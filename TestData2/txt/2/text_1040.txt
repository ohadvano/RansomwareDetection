I nod. “I am aware, yes. Terry was a good person.”
Tom looks at me as though I have piqued his curiosity. “You knew the victim?” He writes on his notepad.
“Yes, we worked together at the diner.” I can feel myself getting emotional just by talking about him.
“And were you and the victim	close?”
Ryder snarls. “What are you suggesting? That she was romantically involved with a guy that's old enough to be her dad?”
Ryder's words cause me to wince to which he notices straight away and looks at me apologetically.
I shake my head. “Terry was someone that I considered a very close friend of mine. He always kept to himself and he loved working at the diner. It was like his second home.” I wipe away a tear.
Tom looks at me with sorrow. “Boys, I'd like to have a few words with Alice here alone.”
Why would Tom want to speak with me? He didn't think I was suspicious, did he?
