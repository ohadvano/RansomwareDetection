The last time Sam and I spoke was at my house after bringing Max there from the party, and she didn't seem happy with me at all and we never argue, but you see with Sam, she forgives and forgets a lot quicker than most teenaged girls.
“I look different?”
She smirks as she whispers to me. “Were you by any chance with a boy this weekend, Alice?”
I was with several actually, but one boy in particular. I shrug. “You could say that.”
She gasps. “You were with a boy, were you? And I'm guessing that it's either Max or Ryder because they're the only two guys that you talk to, but I'm telling you right now that you better not have touched a single hair on Bane's head because he is mine!”
“I wasn't with Bane.” I grimace.
Ew.
She takes a deep breath. “Oh thank god. I genuinely thought for a moment there that I was gonna have to bitch slap you.”
“You wouldn't.” I roll my eyes.
