SELENIUM is an anti-oxidant, which helps prevent the hemoglobin in red blood

cel s from being damaged by oxidation. Some natural food sources are kelp, garlic, grains,

and most vegetables.



SILICON is essential for building strong bones, and for the normal growth of hair,

nails, and teeth. It is beneficial in al healing processes, and protects the body against

many diseases. Some natural food sources are fruits, particularly apples, whole grains,

beets, onions, parsnips, and almonds.



SODIUM has a special function in the body to prevent clotting of the blood, to

stimulate the spleen, to regulate heat in body fluids, to neutralize acid, and relax the heart

muscle as wel as other muscles in the body. Sodium, as an organic mineral does not

present any problem to the body if used in moderation; but sodium chloride (common

table salt) the inorganic form, can cause problems such as fluid retention, kidney damage,

heart problems, high blood pressure, etc.. Some natural food sources are kelp, celery,

romaine lettuce, watermelon, and sea salt.



145





SULPHUR is found in every cel of the body. The cel s that contain most of the sulphur are

those of the skin, hair, and joints. That is why it is sometimes cal ed the beauty mineral.

Some natural food sources are radishes, turnips, onions, celery, string beans, kale,

watercress, and soybeans.



TIN is needed for the human body, but little more than this is presently known. This

trace mineral element is found in al vegetation growing on soil that is not depleted of tin.



VANADIUM is also a trace mineral that the human body needs, but little more than

this is presently known Natural food sources are whole unrefined grains.

ZINC is needed for the brain, the retina of the eye, and the visual process, as wel

as for normal growth, especial y of the bones. It is also needed for the development of the

sex organs, and for the normal function of the prostrate gland. A zinc deficiency leads to a

diminished sensitivity to taste and smel . Some natural food sources are pumpkin seeds,

sunflower seeds, nuts and green leafy vegetables.

Thus we have taken a look at the 21 minerals our body must have in order to

function properly. Have you noticed how each one of these minerals can be found in the

natural foods God has given us to eat? I want to encourage you to get your minerals from

the natural food as grown, and not in any supplemental form. Vitamin or mineral

supplements are not natural. The synthetic ones are chemicals; and the ones derived from

the plant itself are refined in the sense that they are separated from the rest of the

vitamins, minerals, and enzymes that were in the plant from the beginning.

If the good Lord would have wanted us to take a calcium pil , He would have

created a tree that grew calcium pil s. Instead, He created the almond tree, orange tree,

etc. to grow almonds and oranges, which are high in calcium.

MENOPAUSE



Menopause, (mono meaning month and pause meaning cessation), also referred to

as "change of life." is a natural progression of aging instead of some kind of disease or

hormonal malfunction. It is the time when women stop ovulating.

Menopause usual y occurs between 35 and 58 years of age. The menses may stop

suddenly, there may be a decreased flow each month until there is a final cessation, or the

interval between periods may be lengthened until complete cessation is accomplished.

Menopause cannot be said to have occurred until there has been no menstruation for

twelve months or more.

Natural menopause wil occur in 25% of women by age 47, in 50% by age 50, 75%

by age 52, and in 95% by age 55.

The symptoms that may be associated with menopause can last from a few months

to years varying from being hardly noticeable to severe. With the reduction of estrogen

that occurs from inactive ovarian function, there is a gradual shrinkage of the lining

membranes of the vagina, the vulva, the uterus and the fal opian tubes. A sensation of

dryness, itching, and other symptoms may result. Other symptoms are: vasomotor

instability, nervousness, hot flashes, chil s, excitability, fatigue, apathy, mental depression,

crying, palpitations, vertigo headache, numbness, tingling, urinary disturbances and

stomach and bowel problems.

Hot flashes, or hot flushes, may start with an aura fol owed by a feeling of

discomfort in the abdominal area, perhaps a chil quickly fol owed by a feeling of heat

moving toward the head. Next the face becomes red and sweating is fol owed by

exhaustion.

At puberty the female body begins a cycle of preparing for possible pregnancy

every 28 days. The process is regulated by an intricate interplay of the hormones estrogen

and progesterone. This process continues for the next 35 to 40 years. At that time the

hormones control ing the process start to diminish and the body enters the phase of

menopause.

With the decrease in sexual hormones the woman's body begins to change. Lower

levels of estrogen are thought to cause malfunctions in the body's temperature-regulating

center (the hypothalamus) resulting in hot flashes. Some women have very few problems

with menopause. For others the problems are minimal and some women have major

problems going through menopause. What I have observed over the years is that the

stronger and healthier the women, (due to a good life style, which results in a strong

immune system), the fewer problems they have while going through menopause.

Vegetarian women are definitely at an advantage in handling menopause successful y.

Estrogen is a complex and powerful hormone and an imbalance can cause many

problems throughout the body. It is produced mainly in the ovaries in response to the

hormonal signals it receives from the pituitary gland. Smal amounts of estrogen are also

produced by the adrenal glands.

As the ovaries quit producing estrogen, two areas need to be evaluated. They are

the thyroid and adrenal glands. Like the ovaries, the thyroid is control ed by the pituitary

gland. During menopause we want to make certain that the ovaries are getting adequate

hormonal stimulus from the pituitary. An underactive thyroid can increase the workload of



147

the pituitary to the point the ovary stimulation is compromised. To determine if your thyroid

is overactive, underactive or normal see accompanying information box.





THYROID

The thyroid is a smal gland located in the neck just above the col ar bone. It produces hormones that help regulate the

metabolism in every cel of the body.



Thyroid Temperature Test

Every morning before you get out of bed take your temperature under your arm for five minutes. Keep stil

and quiet, any motion can upset the temperature reading. Keep a record for four weeks. A normal axil ary temperature

would be from 97.8 -98.4. If it is less than 97.8 you have an underactive thyroid. If it is over 98.4 you probably have

an overactive thyroid.

If your thyroid is underactive then you need to fol ow the suggestions mentioned.

Very often hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms wil be eliminated or greatly

improved when an under-active thyroid becomes normal again.

Next, we need to look at the adrenal glands. When they are functioning properly,

they have the capability of producing estrogen. Even smal amounts can produce very

positive results. Almost al women suffering from menopause problems wil have both

underactive thyroids and underactive adrenal glands. Unresolved stress and high intakes

of caffeine and sugar are the most common causes of weakened adrenal glands.



DIET PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART IN MENOPAUSE



One new study has focused on the use of foods containing phytoestrogens to help

regulate menopause. Phytoestrogens are chemical sub-stances found in plants that can

balance the body's natural estrogen levels. In Australia, researchers fed 23 menopausal

women 10% of their calories in the form of phytoestrogen-containing foods such as soy

flour. Afterwards researchers evaluated the maturation of the women's vaginal cel s (one

reliable indication of estrogen activity). In only two weeks maturation had increased 40%(1).

Another very rich source of phytoestrogens is pomegranate seeds. They contain an

estrogen-like compound practical y identical to natural estrogen(2). Some other foods

containing phytoestrogens are: sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, dry barley seedlings,

peanuts, soybeans, common bean seedlings, pea seedlings, corn, radish greens, figs,

beets, okra, strawberries, apples, cherries, olives, plums, carrots, yams, eggplant,

tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, brown rice, oats, wheat, and coconut, with sesame seeds

and sunflower seeds being the two highest in phytoestrogens from this list.

Women who are overweight should be on two meals a day. No water should be

taken at meal time, but plenty of pure soft water should be consumed daily. How much is

plenty? It depends upon your weight. To know the approximate amount of water needed

daily for a sedentary person, you divide the person's weight in half and that is how many

ounces of water they need. For example, a 150 Ib. person's weight is divided in half which

would be 75, so they need 75 ounces of water, which would be approximately nine 8

ounce glasses of water daily. If they work out in the hot sun or sweat a lot they need more.

Most individuals do not eat enough natural foods. What kind of foods should we eat? Al

the natural ones, the more natural the better. Fresh fruit instead of canned fruit, whole

wheat bread instead of white bread, brown rice instead of white rice, honey instead of

sugar, etc. What should we not eat? animal and animal products and sugar. Dairy

products, sugar and meat cause most hot flashes (3).

Exercise is also important, especial y during menopause; outside work in the yard

or garden, walking, bicycling or swimming but no running or jogging.

Sunbathing is another way to help lessen the symptoms of menopause. When

sunlight strikes the skin, it produces sex hormones in the skin itself. Sunlight elevates the

human-female hormones (4).

Avoid stressful situations as much as possible. Stress can be reduced greatly by

daily exercise and sunbathing and taking your problems to God in prayer.



WHAT ABOUT TAKING ESTROGEN?



No, no, no, no, estrogen injections or tablets are NOT NATURAL Estrogen is made

from the urine of a pregnant horse! Premarin is a common estrogen tablet taken during



149

menopause. This drug, premarin, is listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference and has over

two pages of information written on it. Listed below is some of this information. Warning:

"Estrogens have been reported to increase the risk of Endometrial Carcinoma in post

menopausal women." Estrogens should not be used during pregnancy. Estrogens can

cause breast cancer, gal bladder disease, fluid retention, uterine bleeding, uterine fibroids,

impaired liver function, vaginal candidiasis, breast tenderness or enlargement, nausea,

vomiting, abdominal cramps, bloating, headaches, mental depression, spotty darkening of

the skin, particularly on the face, etc. These are some of the side effects of Premarin listed

in the Physicians' Desk Reference. Of course not everyone who takes Premarin wil have

al these side effects.



HERBS TO TAKE FOR MENOPAUSE



Herbs are God's medicine for sickness. Wild yam root, black cohosh and red rasp-

berry are just three of the many herbs that are good for menopause. My favorite, and the

one I think works best is wild yam root. The best way to take any herb is in tea form.

Capsules and tinctures are not as effective. With wild yam root you would use 1 1/2

teaspoons per 8 oz. cup. Boil for 10 minutes, then let steep 20 minutes, strain and drink.

Most teas you do not boil, but the exception is when you are using the root. Best time to

drink the tea is right before bed on an empty stomach. Drink one cup daily. You should be

able to buy any of these herbs in any good health food store.

NATURAL BIRTH CONTROL





There are many forms of birth control which are harmful to the

human body, some of these forms which I would not recommend

are:



Birth control pil s, which are steroids, they act by preventing

ovulation and are almost 100% effective, but have many side

effects and are harmful to the body. Spermicides in the form of

foam, placed in the vagina prior to a intimate relationship, act by

kil ing the sperm are also harmful to the body. lUD's or intrauterine

contraceptive devices, are plastic or metal objects (usual y copper)

that are placed inside the uterus. They act by preventing the

fertilized egg from attaching itself to the lining of the uterus. These

are foreign objects that are within the body and often the body wil

try to reject the IUD causing side effects. Diaphragms are dome-

shaped pieces of rubber with a flexible spring circling the edge. It is inserted into the

vagina so as to cover the cervix and must be used in conjunction with a chemical spermi-

cide. Tubal ligation involves surgical division of the fal opian tubes and ligating the cut

ends. This form of sterilization is effective but virtual y irreversible and causes many

problems as each month the eggs are unable to be discarded the normal way through the

vagina and must be absorbed into the blood stream and eventual y eliminated by the

kidneys. Vasectomv consists of cutting the vas deferens and tying each end so the sperm

can no longer travel from the testicles to the urethra. This form of sterilization is effective

but also can cause problems.



One form of birth control which is not natural, but causes no harm to the body, is a

condom. They can be made of rubber or animal membranes. I do not recommend using

the animal membranes. This is a highly reliable means of contraception.



Natural Ways of Birth Control Are:



Calendar Rhythm Method

Over the years, the rhythm method alone has proven to be only 60-80% effective.

Ovulation occurs approximately 2 weeks prior to the next period. Fourteen days is the

average, but it can occur 12-16 days before the fol owing period. If you had a list of your

previous cycles for 12 months (the more the better) you wil be able to determine if you

have a 28 days cycle, or if it is longer or shorter that 28 days. You then count back 14

days from the start of your period and that is the time of ovulation when a pregnancy can

occur.



In order for a pregnancy to occur a fresh, live sperm from the man must meet and

fertilize a live egg from the woman. This can only happen during the few days in the

woman's fertility cycle. Pregnancy can happen if there is an intimate relationship at the



151

exact time of ovulation. It is also possible to get pregnant up to 72 hours before ovulation.

The sperm normal y lives 2 or 3 days (possibly up to 5 in ideal situations). Since the egg

can live from 12-24 hours a person needs to abstain for 24 hours after ovulation. In order

to avoid pregnancy, a couple must abstain for 3 days preceding ovulation and 1 day after

(see chart on page 2).



This method would be very simple if we could pinpoint the exact time of ovulation

each month. Since we can only estimate the approximate time of ovulation we need to

al ow some extra leeway for error. Sickness, travel, worry, excitement, etc. can cause an

irregular cycle once in a while for most women, and often for a few women.



Researchers found that conception was more common from early

winter to spring (October to March). The most fertile month was

November. (British Journal, 297:1,309-10)





Cervical Mucus Method



In the female, cervical mucus is being created al the time by special cel s inside the

cervix and changes character during the monthly cycle. You may have noticed this normal

discharge and wondered why it was so profuse at times and absent at other times. You

wil find this mucus at your vaginal opening you do not need to check inside.





In the beginning and end of the cycle (the safe time) when the hormone estrogen is

low, the mucus is scant, sticky and opaque with cel ular matter. In the middle of the cycle

(the unsafe time) it changes to fertile type mucus. As the estrogen level increases,

preparing for ovulation, the quantity of mucus increases. It becomes thinner and milkier.

Then, with more estrogen, it gets clearer and more watery. At the estrogen peak, right

before ovulation, it gets slick and glassy and you may be able to stretch an unbroken

shimmering thread of it between your thumb and forefinger.



At this fertile time, the mucus has usual y increased to ten times what it was earlier.

This abundant fertile mucus is helpful to the sperm. It nourishes them, guides them

upward through fiber -like channels, and protects them from the acid ph of the vagina (the

mucus is alkaline.



After ovulation, the hormone progesterone causes the mucus to change to an

infertile type within a day or two. Progesterone inhibits the mucus-producing cel s of the

cervix and the mucus again becomes scant, thick, sticky, and opaque white or yel ow from

cel ular matter and protein content. After the fertile phase, the mucus wil return to the dry

or sticky type. Note: Check mucus at times when not ready to have an intimate

relationship as this wil produce lubricating mucus which is not the same as cervical

mucus.





SPERM CAN LIVE UP TO 5 DAYS. EGGS LIVE FROM 12-24 HOURS.





Basal Body Temperature Method



A reproductive hormone that is released after ovulation causes the body

temperature to rise several tenths of one degree over what it was before ovulation. To

avoid pregnancy, the safest time to have an intimate relationship is after you are sure you



152

have already ovulated. You wil have relatively low temperatures from the time of your

period until you ovulate. Ovulation wil cause a rise of about 6/10 of one degree. This rise

can happen in a day or it can stair-step up over a period of several days. After you have

recorded four consecutive days with a temperature that is higher than your normal

temperature then it is a safe time.



You must remember that five days prior to ovulation when the temperature is

normal is an unsafe time due to the fact that sperm can live up to 5 days.



If you want the absolute surest, most infallible form of natural birth control,

you only have an intimate relationship in the later part of the cycle (after the

rise in temperature for four consecutive days) until the time of the period. The

unsafe time being from the period to ovulation.





Note: Take your temperature within an hour of the same time each morning upon

awakening, If you sleep late, your temperature could show a false rise. Use a Basal

Thermometer, which measures in l/10th degrees instead of 2/10th degrees like a regular

thermometer. You should take your temperature rectal y or vaginal y rather than by mouth

because it is more accurate. A very important aspect of this method is keeping good

charts and records.



Herbs





Wild yam root contains diosgenin, used to manufacture progesterone. Most of the

steroid hormones used in modern medicine, especial y those in contraceptives, were

developed from elaborately processed chemical components. It is best to take this herb in

tea form, one glass just before bed each night. Use distil ed water or reverse-osmosis

water, bring to a boil, remove from stove, add 1 - 2 teaspoons of the herb and let steep for

20 minutes or longer.



153





OVERWEIGHT





Sixty-two percent of the American people are overweight -

that is more than one out of every two people in the United States!

Since intemperance in eating is such a major problem, I feel

compel ed to write about it. After twenty years of dieting, says a

national survey, the average American is now five pounds heavier.

The American Seating Company, one of the world's leading chair

manufacturers, has widened their standard seats by two inches to

accommodate the ever expanding American.





People are concerned about their weight. According to a

recent survey commissioned by the Calorie Control Council, 40 -

50 percent of those between the ages of 35 and 59 years old were

dieting. There is a difference between being overweight and being obese. If you can pinch

an inch of fat at your lower rib, you are overweight; and you are obese if you are 20% or

more overweight.



For every extra pound of weight, you shorten your lifespan by one month; so

someone who is 24 pounds overweight would die 2 years sooner. If you are obese, you

have a three times greater chance of having heart disease, are five times more likely to

develop diabetes, and are more likely to develop osteoarthritis and low back pain. You are

also more likely to develop cancer of the colon, breast, prostrate, cervix, uterus, and

ovaries. As the statistics plainly show, being twenty percent or more overweight, wil not

produce good health.



The reason that 62% of the people in this country are overweight is because of our

traditional eating habits. Americans eat a hearty breakfast, a hearty lunch, a hearty dinner,

and snack the rest of the time. Far more time is spent appropriating than eliminating, so

we carry around much excess fat.



Mankind believes that he can put large amounts of natural or unnatural foods into

his body and not have to take the blame for the sickness he brings upon himself by his

own improper choices.



If we eat three meals a day, we should have three eliminations a day. When natural

elimination is made difficult, then a special method for cleansing the body of these toxic

wastes is put into action, through sneezing, colds, discharges from the nose & eyes,

sores, and skin diseases of many kinds, such as pimples, boils, abscesses and ulcers.



Poor eating habits, and the taking of drugs, prevent or hinder our body from

keeping our system clean. Many of these toxins end up being stored in our bodies as fat,

or in our organs such as our kidneys as kidney stones, or in our gal bladder as gal stones;

or our arteries become plugged with arterial plaques which can cause a heart attack or



154

stroke. Al of these diseases, and many more, are the result of improper eating which

causes a high toxic build-up in the body.



It is important to realize that the body fluids, which contribute to the life processes,

are al alkaline except for the gastric juice;, and that the waste fluids are al acid, such as

the urine, perspiration, etc.. These acid products must be eliminated because the healthy

state of the body is one of alkalinity. If the tissues of the body become acid, il ness occurs.

This toxic acid build up in the body is the result of eating too many concentrated foods.

Ideal y, we should be eating a diet that consists of 80% alkaline forming foods, 20% acid

forming foods, as wel as a limited amount of high concentration foods (i.e. those

containing low water content).





First, let's look at some foods that are acid forming: meat, eggs, al grains (except

mil et and buckwheat), and al nuts (except almonds and brazil nuts). These foods should

make up 20% of our diet, except for the meat and eggs, which we should not use. The

other 80% of our diet should be made up of al alkaline-forming foods, which are fresh

fruits and vegetables. Concentrated foods (those with low or no water content) should be

eaten in limited amounts, whereas fresh fruits and vegetables have a high water content

and can be eaten in large amounts. Since our bodies are composed of a high percentage

of water, then we need to eat large amounts of fruits and vegetables which are also a high

percentage of water. This water in the food we eat transports the nutrients in the food to

al the body's cel s, and in turn removes toxic wastes.



So we see then that for optimum health we need to be eating meals that consist

largely (80%) of fruits and vegetables, and 20% of acid forming foods such as grains and

nuts; and that the concentrated foods (foods low in water) should be eaten in limited

amounts. As you eat more natural fresh foods, your caloric intake wil become less, but yet

you wil feel ful . For example, one apple has 80 calories, is 83% water, and is alkaline, as

opposed to l/6th of an apple pie, which has 405 calories, is quite low in water content, and

is both alkaline (apples) and acid (the crust). If we fol ow these guidelines, our

eliminations, in time, wil become normal, our body wil be able to get rid of the large

amounts of excess weight and toxins, and we wil start feeling great and losing weight.



So far, we have looked only at the physical disadvantages of being overweight; but

what about the mental disadvantages. Overweight or obese persons, as a general rule,

are insecure; they don't feel accepted because of their weight. They are not happy

inwardly, even though many try to put on an outward show. They are not as ambitious

when it involves physical activities. They are not happy with themselves because of their

weight problems; and consequently they usual y are not happy with others. They also tend

to be highly emotional; and most are unable to control their tempers.



These are just a few of the mental disadvantages associated with being overweight

or obese. I personal y believe that through the power of prayer, and fol owing God, a

person can get the victory and wil become temperate in their appetite; and this wil

change them spiritual y, mental y, and physical y. Then they can be the happy, healthy

person God has always wanted them to be.



.





155

It takes wil power and determination with God's help, to overcome appetite. Just

like any other habit you want to overcome, you must plan your strategy so you wil not fal

again and again and again. What can I do when those hunger pangs strike and I am

tempted to be intemperate? Drinking a glass of water can displace cravings for food.

Since dehydration encourages cravings for food, it is vital to consume adequate water

every day. You wil find that if you drink your water quota between meals (a minimum of

eight (8) glasses daily, you wil feel satisfied and be less likely to crave food between

meals.





Because exercise helps to curb hunger, taking a brisk walk outside in the fresh air

is an excel ent aid. During working hours or whenever time is limited, even a few minutes

spent deeply breathing fresh air can rejuvenate you and take your mind off food. Diversion

tactics are also helpful, such as going to visit a friend, working in the garden, or shopping.





First of al , exercising in the morning increases the body's metabolism, causing the

body to burn calories at nearly twice the rate for the next six hours. Exercise gears up the

body's metabolism, and increases its ability to "burn" calories. Exercise should be a main
