


Walking is the simplest type of exercise and the best al -around prescription of

healthful living. It is free, requires no expensive equipment, and is suitable for al ages. It

can be done at your own convenience, either alone or with a companion. The best way to

keep fit is to walk, and walk, and walk, and walk.

TEMPERANCE - A

REMEDY FOR

DISEASE





" Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in al things." (1 Corinthians

9:25). Our problems and our sicknesses are often the result of our own intemperate habits.

A man does not die; he kil s himself. A healthy, happy person is one who is wel balanced

physical y, mental y, and spiritual y.

Temperance means self control or moderation in the enjoyment of those things

which are good, and the avoidance of that which is harmful. For a better understanding of

temperance, I am breaking this chapter into two sections. Part I wil deal with moderation

in that which is good; and part two wil deal with avoiding that which is harmful.





PART I - MODERATION IN THAT WHICH IS GOOD





We learned earlier in this book that sunshine is very healing to the body, but too

much sunshine wil result in sunburn; too much exercise wil cause exhaustion; too much

sleep causes one to become lazy; too much money causes one to become selfish; too

much entertainment causes one to become irresponsible; too much reading can ruin one's

eyes; too much hurrying can cause a nervous breakdown, and too much food can cause

obesity. We can plainly see that we al need some sunshine, some exercise, some food,

etc., but too much is harmful. If a little is good that doesn't mean that a lot is better. This is

especial y true when it comes to food. We need moderation in al good things, and I'm

going to be covering just three of them, moderation in food, cleanliness, and

entertainment.



62





MODERATION IN FOOD



Most obese people can improve their situation by simply reducing their intake of

food and increasing physical activity. Overeating can be the root cause of any number of

il nesses, from gastric indigestion, obesity, heart disease, etc. The less active an individual

is, the less food is required. Overeating not only puts undue stress on the digestive

organs, but it weakens the entire body system making it more prone to disease. A person

who can control his appetite is a self-disciplined individual.



MODERATION IN CLEANLINESS





Personal cleanliness is actual y another type of moderation, cleanliness of

body and clothes. No one wants to be around someone who doesn't regularly bathe or

wash their clothes. Cleanliness of one's home and belongings is also important. Have you

ever had the unfortunate experience of visiting someone whose house was so dirty and

cluttered that you could hardly get in the front door? Many diseases are the result of poor

sanitation. Closely related to cleanliness, is neatness and tidiness. Keeping things neat

and in order is encouraging to our mental attitude.



MODERATION IN ENTERTAINMENT





The major entertainment in America is the television set. The average child

watches over 40 hours of T.V. a week. That adds up to almost 6 hours a day. This is not

moderation at al and that is why we are having so many problems with our youth today

like violence, sexual permissiveness, disrespect, lying, stealing, etc. What can we expect

when they watch this on T.V. over 40 hours every week?

Television is a very poor substitute for entertainment. What happened to the days

when families did things together, like biking, camping, hiking, father and son building

something together, mother teaching her daughter how to bake

bread or make a dress? What do most families do together today?

They watch T.V. together, where there is no communication

between them; it is al one way. The T.V. is communicating its

negative system of beliefs to them. Why do we have a generation

gap? Why do we have poor reading skil s? Why do we have such

negative outlooks on life? Why are we overweight and physical y

unfit? Why do we have such short attention spans? Why does

actual life seem boring? The answer to al these and more is the television. We as a

nation have not been selective in the programs we see nor the amount of T. V. we watch.

The Bible tel s us what we sow, we shal reap; and we here in America are now reaping

the results of improper television viewing. May God help us to see our errors.



PART II - AVOIDING THAT WHICH IS HARMFUL





The second part of the definition of temperance is

"avoidance of that which is harmfulâ€. There are literal y

thousands of things that are harmful, but we wil be looking at

just a few of these. We al know we should avoid such things



63



as alcohol, tobacco and drugs. They are a poison to the body and we should stay away

from them. Since you already know this, I wil not make any further mention of them. What

I want to share with you are things that you may not be aware of that are harmful to your

body. I have picked out 6 that we're going to look at. They are coffee, tea, colas,

chocolate, baking powder and soda.



HARMFUL EFFECTS OF COFFEE. TEA. COLAS AND CHOCOLATE





These al contain methylxanthines which can cause physical and physiological

damage. Al of the methylxanthines have been associated with chromosome damage and

deformities in the offspring of the user; and cancer is more common in those who use

methylxanthines, especial y chocolate, which may begin developing cysts and fibrous

tumors especial y in the breast, the so-cal ed fibrocystic disease. Methylxanthines have

the ability to alter the very protoplasm of cel s, and to attach or concentrate in cel s for an

unknown period of time. The effects begin shortly after taking the drink containing them,

and lasts for about four hours. Some of the symptoms can be imperfect balance, rapid

heart beat, insomnia, fatigue, finger tremor,

headache, restlessness, irritability, depression and

gastrointestinal disturbances.(2) If one is accustomed

to the regular use of coffee, tea, colas or chocolate,

one may feel less alert, less contented, more sleepy

and irritable when there is a delay in having these

products. The shocking thing is that over 90% of the

American population uses caffeine, which is found in

coffee, tea and colas. (See chart). Decaffeinated

coffee and tea have more harmful substances than

the caffeinated. A special note on chocolate - it is ful

of insects, (mainly cockroaches), rodents and other

contaminants. Visible or solid animal excreta must not exceed 10 mil igrams per pound.

For chocolate powder or pressed cakes, there must not be more than 75 insect fragments

in 3 tablespoons of the powder. These are al al owable according to the booklet published

by the United States Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare, entitled "The Food Defect

Action Levelsâ€.



90% of the American Population use caffeine





HARMFUL EFFECTS OF BAKING POWDER AND SODA





The use of soda and baking powder is harmful. Soda causes inflammation of the

stomach by eating away the lining of the stomach. Soda also decreases the pancreatic

juices, which are used for digestion; and al baking powders leave a residue of soda and

bicarbonate of soda which destroys vitamins. The alum baking powder leaves a residue

consisting of Glauber's salts (sulfate of soda) and aluminum hydrate (which itself is

poisonous to the body). The cream of tartar baking powders leave a residue of tartar of

soda and potash -Rochel e salts. The phosphoric baking powders leave a residue of

phosphate of lime and soda.(3) Some health food stores carry a baking powder which they

are told is a health baking powder and is not harmful. This is not true, there has never

come on the market a baking powder that does not leave a residue of soda.

CLOSING

Our bodies are not our own, to treat as we please, to cripple by habits that lead to

decay. The wonderful mechanism of the human body does not receive half the care that is

often given to a mere lifeless machine. Our bodies belong to God, He has arranged every

fiber and nerve and sinew and muscle and wil keep our bodies in perfect health, if we wil

cooperate with Him by being temperate and obeying His natural laws of health.

TRUST IN GOD





Stress today is one of the major causes of disease and death in our modern

society. Worry and fear are burning out the life forces. As many as 32 mil ion people, 15%

of al Americans, require some form of mental health services. In addition, approximately

25% of the American population suffers severe emotional stress; this means that a total of

40% of the American population have severe emotional problems.

I have found that one's problems are most often the

result of one's own wrong habits and decisions. Great

intel ectual and spiritual powers are not the result of

chance; they are the fruits of effort. Many of the diseases

from which men suffer are the result of mental depression.

Certain classes of thoughts produce hormones that tend

to destroy the health of the mind and break down the life

forces. These include hatred, anxiety, jealousy, anger,

fear, envy, excitement, prolonged or abnormal sexual

stimulation, excessive ambition, worry, guilt, etc.

The condition of the mind affects the health to a far greater degree than many realize.

People who always frown, worry, lose their tempers very quickly, hold grudges, or are

always tense, are causing toxic poisons to circulate through their body. As the adrenal

glands secrete their adrenaline (which is very toxic if not used up) into the bloodstream, it

causes many adverse side effects, such as headaches, ulcers, high blood pressure, etc.

For example, if you are attacked by a dog, your adrenal glands immediately pour

adrenaline into your system to give you supernatural strength to run or fight. However,

when you get mad or unhappy, this adrenaline again pumps into your system and if you

do not use up this adrenaline, it becomes toxic and affects the internal organs of the body.

It is very important then, that you learn to take your problems to God and He wil help you

smile your worries away, and help you control your temper so that the adrenal glands



66



won't dump adrenaline into your system. But if you do get upset, go out for a brisk walk,

chop wood, etc. to help burn up some of the excess toxic adrenaline.



WRONG ATTITUDE CAN CAUSE DISEASE



Disease is sometimes produced and is often greatly aggravated, by the

imagination. I've known people who have had minor il nesses and felt so sorry for

themselves, that if the normal recovery rate for their il ness was 6 weeks, it would take

them 3 or 4 months to recover. I've known others who

have had major il nesses, who were given just a few

months to live, but these people didn't feel sorry for

themselves. They were fighters; they said, "No way, Doc.

I'm going to beat this cancer;" and many do. A positive

mental attitude can cure us, or a negative mental attitude

can put us in the grave.



The American people today are programmed to be

negative. Our news media, the newspaper, television and

radio, scream the trophies of pain each day. Almost

everything is negative. If I were to publish a newspaper I

would print mostly positive news, relegating negative news to the back page; in that way

anyone who wanted to make the news would have to do something positive. Today, the

opposite is true, and the news is slanted to cover the unpleasant, the ugly, the tragic; and

this promotes feelings of suspicion, envy, unhappiness, etc. A man's mind may be likened

to a garden, which may be intel igently cultivated or al owed to grow weeds: but whether

cultivated or neglected, it wil bring forth according to what he has dwelt upon. Good

thoughts wil produce good actions; bad thoughts wil produce bad actions.



MENTAL THOUGHTS AFFECT PHYSICAL HEALTH

You've been invited to a friend's house for a dinner party. You are there with al

your friends eating and having a great time. You especial y are enjoying the good food.

You hear the phone ring and the hostess says it's for you. As you pick up the receiver your

mother on the other end says your brother was just kil ed in a car accident two hours ago.

Suddenly you feel weak and dizzy, you can't think straight; your appetite is now gone, your

whole body just shuts down, and you are in a daze. What changed your whole physical

wel -being? Just 5 words ('your brother was just kil ed'). I am thankful that this is not a true

story; but I believe it shows us that the relation that exists between the mind and the body

is very intimate. When one is affected, the other sympathizes.

Another class of thoughts produces hormones that have a beneficial effect on

circulation, digestion, movement of the intestines, and even the production of blood and

antibodies. These thoughts are patience, love, joy, peace, kindness, sympathy, etc.

Nothing tends more to promote health of body and soul than does a loving, forgivable

spirit.

I believe we were put on this earth to be a blessing to others; our lives should be a

life of service for humanity. Did you know that the average American dies just three years

after he begins receiving Social Security? Studies have shown that early deaths are partly

due to the fact that, when retirement is suddenly thrust upon a person they find that they

have lost their purpose in life. The best preparation for retirement is to begin working for

God by helping others now. This wil give you a purpose for living and then you wil have

something very worthwhile to do when your retirement years come.

Deeds of kindness and unselfish service are twice a blessing, benefiting both the

giver and the receiver of the kindness. The consciousness of right doing is one of the best



67



medicines for diseased bodies and minds. When the mind is free and happy from a sense

of duty wel done and the satisfaction of giving happiness to others, the cheering, uplifting

influence brings new life to the whole being.





CHOOSING TO FOLLOW GOD IS THE SECRET OF HAPPINESS





In the human mind we have the greatest potential force for good or evil depending

upon how we choose to use that great intel ect God gave us. There are only two powers in

this world of ours, the power for good and the power for evil. Each one of us has a choice

to make - a choice to serve God and fol ow Him, or to serve self and fol ow the devil.



Power for Good (God) versus Power for Evil (Devil)



God wants to save you

The devil wants to destroy you

He is the author of life

He is the author of death

God wants you to be healthy The devil wants you to be sick

To be temperate in all things To be intemperate in all things

God wants you to be happy

The devil wants you to be sad

Helping those in need brings One who lives only for self

happiness





is never happy



The secret of happiness is to go beyond the cal of duty in al things - to render

more and better service than is expected of you no matter what your task may be. The

surest way to doom yourself is to perform only work for which you are paid. Think not that

you are being cheated if you deliver more than what you receive. There is a pendulum to

al life: if not rewarded to day it wil swing back tomorrow ten-fold.





The Power of Choice is a Great Gift



Choose to love rather than hate

Choose to laugh rather than cry

Choose to create rather than destroy

Choose to go ahead rather than quit

Choose to praise rather than gossip

Choose to heal rather than destroy

Choose to give rather than steal

Choose to pray rather than curse



THE BIBLE HAS THE ANSWERS

For those interested in studying the Bible, I would suggest

that you first always pray before opening the Bible to read

it. In your prayer ask the lord to help you to understand

what you are about to read. There are many infidels who

have studied the Bible, but they were the studying it for

the wrong reason. Those who study the Bible to find God

are studying it for the right reason, and they wil not be

disappointed.

PART II





This section of the book

deals with specific information on

various health problems. There will

be some repetitions in this section

due to the overlapping of certain

health problems and what one

should do for them.



Part II can be used as a quick and

easy reference guide to enable the

reader to look up information on

specific health problems.

AIDS & CANCER



Note: My program for aids and cancer are exactly the same so I have combined

these two so not to have to duplicate it twice. Of course there are some sections that are

not applicable to Aids such as the facts about chemotherapy. The greatest Doctor of al is

your body with the power of God. For example: when you get cut, no doctor heals the cut,

your body does the healing. When a person has aids or cancer they need to help their

body to heal itself and this program listed below for Aids and Cancer does just that.



Cancer is a uniquely western problem. People in China, Japan, and Southeast Asia

seldom have cancer. Most people in Africa and South and Central America have little fear

of the dread disease, yet in North America, Australia, New Zealand and affluent countries

in Europe, cancer is epidemic. In 2006 cancer wil claim the lives of more than 600,000

persons. More Americans wil die of cancer in the next 14 months then have perished in

every war the nation has ever fought in.





FACTS ABOUT CHEMOTHERAPY



Chemotherapy is thirteen drugs are used in chemotherapy and their consequent side

effects (as listed in the drugs package inserts for physicians), which include: destruction of

the immune system, leukopenia, hemorrhage, gonadal suppression, bone marrow

depression,

phlebosclerosis

(hardening

of

the

veins),

severe

cel ulites,

vesication(blistering), tissue necrosis(death), fever, chil s, nausea, prolonged vomiting,

partial or total hair loss, lethargy, disorientation, ataxis(inability to coordinate muscle

movements), dysarthria( impaired speech), anorexia, entertitis, stomatitis, erythema,

(morbid redness of the skin), anemia, liver failure, kidney failure, cancer, and death



For decades there has been a great deal of controversy within the medical community

over what kind of medical treatment is most efficacious in treating cancer. Latest findings

reveal al conventional medical treatment for cancer is not helpful. The late Dr. Hardin B.

Jones, Professor of Medical Physics and Physiology at Berkeley, California, made a study

lasting 25 years of the lifespan of cancer patients, and concluded that untreated patients

do not die sooner than patients receiving orthodox treatment, (surgery, radiation and

chemotherapy), and in many cases they lived longer. After almost 40 years as a cancer

researcher, Dr. Jones found for example that survival in breast cancer is four times longer

without conventional treatment. He stated, â€œPeople who refused treatment lived for an

average of 12 and a half years. Those who accepted other kinds of treatment lived on an

average of only 3 years.â€ It is important to note that no refutations of Dr. Jones work have

appeared, while on the other hand, his studies have been supported by other researchers,

as a search of the Science Citation Index reveals.



Even the Journal of the American Medical Association took note of the phenomenon

when, in its diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by Dr. Maurice Fox, a biologist from

the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. On the basis of studies carried out at the



70

Harvard School of Public health, Dr. Fox found, among other things, that: Those who

refused medical procedures had a lower mortality rate than those who submitted.





NATURAL CURE FOR AIDS AND CANCER



MUST CHANGE YOUR DIET

In 1979 a special report was issued by the U.S. Surgeon General, citing more than 2,000

scientific studies from around the world, and compiled with the advice of more than 2,000

doctors, nutritionists and biochemists, who concluded that the normal American diet is

dangerous. Of the 2.1 mil ion Americans who died that year, the report said that 1.5 mil ion

died from diseases associated with diet. The report stressed that most people should

reduce the consumption of fat, especial y saturated fats, such as from eggs, butter, or

untrimmed red meats.(1)



Researchers at the University of Victoria in British Columbia did a careful fol ow up on 200

persons who underwent a "spontaneous remission of cancer". They found that 87% of

those persons had switched diets, usual y to a vegetarian diet. Note: A vegetarian diet

will also put aids into remission.



Recently a link between excessive meat eating and cancer has been explained by Dr.

Wil iard J. Visek a research scientist at Cornel University. The problem, according to Dr.

Visek, is ammonia the carcinogenic by-product of meat digestion.



Although aids and cancer are increasing at an alarming rate and they can be prevented,

by keeping our bodyâ€™s immune system up. Much poisoning of the body has been caused

by the use of improper foods, such as meat, dairy products, white sugar, white flour, white

rice, along with the use of liquor, tobacco, coffee, soda and al other denatured foods.

Good wholesome food builds good blood, where as unwholesome food builds a poor

quality of blood. Cancer wil not develop where there is a pure blood stream and the

bodyâ€™s immune system is functioning at its optimum.



For years the National Cancer Institute held fast to the principal that diet had nothing to do

with cancer. Recent overwhelming evidence has forced them to change their mind. They

now even recommend that one consume certain fruits and vegetables in order to prevent

cancer. â€œFruits, such as oranges and bananas, and leafy green and yel ow vegetables,

including carrots and broccoli, al contain cancer preventing vitamins and fiber, and should

be a part of everyoneâ€™s daily dietâ€, says the National Cancer Institute.



To prevent and cure aids or cancer we must keep our bodyâ€™s immune system high. This is

done by fol owing eight simple rules that I wil briefly cover here. Lots of fresh air, using

lots of pure water, eating lots of wholesome natural foods, getting sufficient rest, moderate

daily exercise, getting outside in the sun everyday, being temperate in al we eat and do

and having faith in God.



Every one of us has cancer cells within us. Cancer has to be treated by building the

bodyâ€™s immune system then the bodyâ€™s white blood cells, etc. will attack and

destroy the cancer from within. Cancer cells are weaker than normal cells and will

not get out of control if our immune system is high.



71



HOW DO WE FIGHT AIDS OR CANCER



There is no one drug, herb, or treatment that wil put aids or cancer into remission. Aids or

cancer has to be treated by building the bodyâ€™s immune system. Listed here are some

natural ways to help build the immune system.



ELIMINATE SUGAR AND JUNK FOODS



Eating white sugar wil paralyze and hinder your

white blood cel s from fighting off an infection.

Eating 25 teaspoons of sugar wil paralyze 92%

of your white blood cel s for approximately five

hours. The average American eats over 42

teaspoons of sugar per day. For example: A

banana split has 24 teaspoons of sugar. A 12 oz

coke has approx. 8-10 teaspoons, a piece of

white bread 2 teaspoons. See chart on sugar

content in chapter on sugar. It must be

remembered that sugar or empty calories and

junk foods interfere with the working of the bodyâ€™s immune system.



ELIMINATE HIGH FAT DIET



Diets high in refined fats have long been associated with increased cancer risk. Breast

cancer is more frequent in women on diets high in both saturated fats, (whole milk), and in

animal fat.(2) A low fat diet not only prevents breast cancer but increases the survival of

women who already have breast cancer. (3)



EAT A TOTALLY RAW DIET



This is or wil be the hardest single thing to fol ow, but it is very important. Only raw fruits,

vegetables, nuts and sprouted grains are what you wil be eating until your aids or cancer

is in remission. Nothing cooked no cooked beans, bread, potatoes, etc. Sounds tough, but

let me tel you this is much easier then taking chemotherapy and having your hair fal out,

vomiting, being weak, etc. And, of course chemotherapy for cancer or AZT for aids wil

not build up your immune system. Instead it wil tear it down. Raw food is live food and

possesses the highest nutritive value. It is ful of vitamins, mineral, enzymes,

phytochemicals, etc. Cooked food is dead food, plant any seed and it wil grow. Cook the

seed and then plant it and it wil not grow, because itâ€™s life principle has been destroyed. .

Place cancer cel s in a cooked media and they wil proliferate. Now place the cancer cel s

in a raw matter and they wil disappear! This astounding fact is known to the Cancer

society, but the public was never informed. (4)



DO NOT EAT BETWEEN MEALS



A Swedish study indicated the frequency of snack eating may be related to the risk of

colon cancer. Earlier, largely ignored studies have suggested that each eating episode

over the course of the day increases colon cancer risk. Regular meal intake did not seem

to produce the same risk as did snack consumption. (Cancer Causes and Control3: 77-

81,1992)



72





DRINK ONE TO THREE GLASSES OF CARROT JUICE DAILY



Carrots are a very good source of Vitamin A, and the juice

should be taken 15-30 minutes before your vegetable meal. A

recent study done by Dr. Raymond J. Shamberger, Professor

of the Dept. of Biochemistry, the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio,

showed that Vitamin A is one of the most important aids to the

bodyâ€™s defense system fighting and preventing aids or cancer.

When subjected to carcinogens, this vitamin has a remarkable ability to inhibit the

introduction and or retard the growth of both malignant and non-malignant tumors. (5)



DRINK PLENTY OF PURE SOFT WATER



How much is plenty? It depends upon how much you weigh, you take your weight, divide it

in half and that is how many ounces of water you need in a 24 hour period. Of course if

you are working out in the hot sun and perspiring a lot you would need more. For

example: you weigh 160 lbs. Half of that is 80 so you need 80 ounces, which would be 10

eight ounce glasses. The type of water we need to drink is soft water that is water that has

no minerals, as the minerals in water are inorganic and are harmful to our health. Where

as the minerals in food are organic and our body needs these type of minerals. Two types

TAKE DAILY SUNBATHS



Expose as much of the body to the sun. If you have a light complexion start with ten

minutes and gradual y increase it to a minimum of one hour a day. While sun bathing use

no lotions, sunscreens (they can cause cancer), or oils. Do not wear glasses while sun

bathing as it is important for the ultraviolet light to get into the eyes, and glass of any kind

wil keep the rays out. Interferon is effective against several different kinds of cancer

including carcinoma, sarcoma and leukemia. This fact spurred the American Cancer

Society; to purchase interferon from Finland for experimental use. Dr. Hans Strander of

Finland discovered that he could give interferon to terminal bone cancer patients and

double the number of long term disease free survivors. White blood cel s in our bodies

manufacture this wonderful interferon that can help so dramatical y in cancer. Sunlight is a

great stimulus for increased white blood cel production and thereby increases the

production of interferon.
