NATURAL FOODS





"Let your food be your medicine and your medicine be your food"

Hippocrates



What are natural foods? They are foods that are natural, such as apples, potatoes,

corn, almonds, etc. They have no added artificial flavorings, colors, or preservatives; and

they are foods that are not refined, such as white flour or corn oil.



142 YEAR OLD MAN

In 1980, the Los Angeles Times and Weekly World News carried articles about Wu

Yunging, a man who lived in China. Mr. Yunging was an extraordinary person, for he was

142 years old. What do you suppose his diet consisted of? He said that he eats corn, rice,

sweet potatoes, fruits and vegetables. In other words, he eats no meat, milk, eggs, refined

oils, sugars, etc. He had reached the age of 142 because he ate the kind of foods that

God original y gave to mankind to eat in the Garden of Eden. These foods were fruits,

nuts, grains and vegetables or herb bearing seeds.



DIET IS THE MAJOR CAUSE OF DISEASE

A 712 page report, issued by the U.S. Surgeon General in 1979, which cites more

than 2,000 scientific studies from around the world and was compiled with the advice of

more than 200 doctors, nutritionists and biochemists, came to the conclusion that the

normal American diet is dangerous. Of the 2.1 mil ion Americans who died the report said

that 1.5 mil ion died from diseases associated with diet. The report brought out that most

people should reduce the consumption of fat, especial y saturated fats, such as from eggs,

butter or untrimmed red meat. It suggests more vegetables and fruits, more whole grain

foods, and cereal products. The report recommends that dried beans and peas be used

as a source of protein to replace some animal products. Dietary fat, the report said

increases risks for obesity, some types of cancer, gal bladder and heart disease. The

report also said excess cholesterol levels, strongly associated with heart attacks, should



35





be reduced by limiting consumption of foods of animal origin, such as eggs, dairy

products, meat, poultry and fish.

Our refined food is now kil ing us on the instal ment plan. More than 4,000 heart

attacks occur every day in the United States. Every 50 seconds a new diabetic is

discovered. Half of al Americans over 40 have high blood pressure. These diseases are

not found in 75% of the world's population. Why? Because Americans like to eat; they eat

too much; and they eat the wrong kinds of foods such as meat, milk, eggs, sugar, oil,

refined and processed foods.

"You are what you eat, Natural food, unadulterated, just as it

comes from the Creator, is the food that gives energy, health and

life. Refined food on the other hand, brings fatigue, sickness and

death. Yet man has tried to improve (is that possible?) upon the

natural food God has given us.

What should Americans be eating in order to stay healthy?

Simply this "the more natural the food, the better", whole wheat

flour instead of bleached white flour; brown rice, instead of white rice; fresh peaches,

instead of canned peaches; beans and nuts instead of meat; dried figs instead of a candy

bar, etc.



HARMFUL FOODS THAT DESTROY YOUR HEALTH

There is such a large variety of good natural foods that it would be very time

consuming to try and mention them al . But there are such a limited amount of unnatural

foods that I shal list the majority of them that most Americans use and then proceed to

explain why they are harmful to the body and should not be

Used.

Group I - Al kinds of meats, this includes chicken and fish.



Group II - Al animal products: cheese, ice cream and eggs. (milk covered in

another chapter )

Group III - Alcohol, coffee, tea, colas, chocolate, baking powder, and soda

(covered in another Chapter)

Group IV - Al spices such as pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc.

Group V - Al refined oils.

Group VI - Al refined sugars, such as corn syrup, date sugar, etc. (covered in

another chapter).



Group VII Al refined grains, such as white flour, white rice, etc.

Group VIII Al vitamin and mineral Supplements (covered in another chapter).



After covering these harmful foods and how they hurt the body the last section of

this chapter wil be on simple rules for eating natural foods.



GROUP I - ALL KINDS OF MEAT

Man's Body Was Not Designed To Eat Meat. Let's look at some simple

physiological aspects of meat eating. A carnivore's teeth are long, sharp, and pointed for

ripping and tearing flesh. Man has molars for crushing and grinding.

A carnivore's jaw moves up and down only, for tearing and biting.

Man's moves up and down and from side to side for grinding. A

carnivore's tongue is rough; man's is smooth. A

carnivore's saliva is acid and geared to the



36





digestion of animal protein. Man's saliva is alkaline for the digestion of starch. A

carnivore's intestines are three times the length of its trunk, designed for rapid expulsion of

food stuff, which would otherwise quickly rot. Man's intestines are twelve times the length

of his trunk and designed to keep food in them until al nutrients are extracted. The liver

and kidneys of a carnivore are capable of eliminating large amounts of uric acid whereas

man's liver and kidneys have the capacity to eliminate only a smal amount of uric acid. A

carnivore's urine is acid. Man's is alkaline.



Consider the elephant. How much dead flesh does he eat?

none, and an elephant can live for over a hundred years because

he is a vegetarian. Whereas, carnivorous animals, such as a cat,

or dog live anywhere from 10-15 years. What are the strongest

animals in the world? The ones used for centuries because of their

endurance and strength: elephants, water buffalo, camels, mules,

and horses; and they al have this one thing in common, they are

vegetarians. A lion, which exclusively eats flesh has very little endurance, for he sleeps

approximately 20 hours a day.



PESTICIDES IN FOOD

The presence of at least some pesticide residues in food is an inescapable fact of

life. Plant foods are much lower in pesticide residues than meat and other animal

products. Dairy products general y contain two-fifths the pesticide residues found in meat;

leafy vegetables contain only one twenty-fourth the pesticides found in meat. Nathaniel

Altman's - Total Vegetarian Cooking, p. 21, 1981.



MORE BACTERIA IN MOST MEAT THAN IN MANURE

Meat is dead flesh, and something that is dead should be buried and not put into

our stomachs. Flavor in meat is due to the presence of uric acid that

is in the meat. What is uric acid? It is one of the waste or excretory

products of the body, or simply said, it is the urine of the animal. Uric

acid is not the only thing about meat that is bad. Another thing wrong

is the putrefactive bacteria found in meat. The bacteria in meats are

identical in character with those of manure and are more numerous

in some meats than in fresh manure. A microscopic count has been made of bacteria

found in meats of various kinds, so that people may know what they are getting when they

eat meat (1) See chart.

HIGH MEAT DIET (WHICH IS ALSO HIGH IN FAT) IS MAJOR CAUSE OF HEART

ATTACKS, STROKES, AND CANCER

Meat is an incomplete source of nutrition. As a consequence, reliance on a meat

based diet actual y becomes a liability to human health. But meat is not only a liability for

what it does not contain; it is also a liability for what it does contain; excess protein, fat,

cholesterol, and blood, besides worms, microbes, and cancer viruses. (2)

Over three out of every four people in this country die of cardiovascular disease,

(heart attacks & strokes) or cancer. We haven't always died so massively of heart attacks,

strokes and cancer until after World War I, when we could afford high fat diets of meat,

fish, poultry, eggs and processed foods. Back in 1960, sufficient research evidence was

available to prompt an editorial Statement in the Journal of American Medical Association

which said, a vegetarian diet can prevent 90% of our thrombo-embolic disease (blood

clotting diseases of the head, heart and legs) and 97% of our coronary occlusions. (3)

Nearly everyone knows that Americans today eat too much fat. Around 40-45% of

the calories eaten in the average American diet is from fat. Meat, especial y red meat, is

the single largest source of fat in the U. S. diet. For percentages of fat in certain animal

products, see accompanying chart.



Animal Product

Fat Content (% of total calories)

Steak

65 â€“ 80%

Lamb

75%

Ham

80%

Hot Dog

85%

Whole Milk

50%

Cheese

60 â€“ 85%

Cream Cheese

90%



The Dietary Guideline Advisory Committee has proposed to limit fat intake to 10% of

the calorie intake in 1990. The American Heart Association was total y in support of these

new guidelines. If the American people would reduce their fat intake to 10%, we would see

a large decrease in heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and cancer.



FAT AND CANCER

Populations with a high incidence of cancer were always consuming high fat diets.

The U.S. Academy of Sciences in Washington, D. C., says, "Of al the dietary factors that

have been associated epidemiological y with cancers of various sites, fat has probably

been studied most thoroughly and produced the greatest frequency of direct associations."

In 2005 over 510,000 people in the United States, died of cancer, 1,397 people a day, or

one every 62 seconds. The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society

have now clearly shown that the incidence of several cancers increases with the amount

of meat and fatty foods consumed.(3) Women who eat meat daily have nearly four times as

much breast cancer as those who use meat less than once per week. (5)

Fats elevate serum cholesterol and impede circulation leading to strokes and heart

attacks. Fats increase the chances of getting cancer. Fats increase the chances of getting

diabetes. Fats reduce muscular endurance. Animals store poisons in their fats. Fats delay

digestion. Fats are fattening.





38





CANCEROUS ANIMALS SOLD FOR FOOD

Despite growing evidence of similar cancer viruses in man and animals, animals

with malignancies are stil al owed to be sold by merely removing the obvious cancer area.

Each year mil ions of cattle are sold for food that had malignant eye tumors when

slaughtered. Nevertheless, after condemning only the heads, the carcasses

were sold for food. It is not possible for al the meat stamped, "Grade A

Inspected", to have been inspected. One processing plant in Georgia,

processes 85,000 chickens per day with eight inspectors. That would require

each man to "inspect" more than 10,000 chickens in a day.

Ralph Nader charges that the United States Department of Agriculture

favors big "agribusiness", and therefore fails to protect otherwise defenseless Americans

from bad meat, contaminated poultry and toxic pesticides. In most states, nearly

unmonitored inspectors tend to be subjected, both to intimidation and bribes. As a result,

they routinely approve for processing "4-D" animals - that is, animals that were dead,

dying, diseased and disabled. (6).





CHICKENS â€“ DONÂ´T EAT THEM





Chickens today are commercial y raised on many drugs! They are cramped into very smal

crates; they are not permitted to touch the ground or exercise; and they are ful of

diseases, especial y cancer. Chickens bought by consumers are heavily contaminated by

intestinal microorganisms from the animals, chiefly E. Coli. If the chickens have been fed

antibiotics, those germs are usual y resistant to antibiotics .(7) In addition to antibiotics and

contagious infections, sometimes, chickens are subjected to contaminated feed. Chickens

and eggs were contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls in Idaho and Montana in 1979.



FISH - GOOD FOR THE FISH BOWL. BUT NOT FOR YOU

Many fish are ful of toxic chemicals that have been dumped into our lakes and

oceans. Human viruses present in contaminated water are now found

in fish, and can be carried to man without infecting the fish in the

transaction. These organisms have been found in unprecedented

numbers, and include human polio viruses, cox sackie viruses and

rheo viruses. (8)

In several areas in the United States, the fish tapeworm

(Diphyllobothrium latum), has been identified in man. Infection occurs when undercooked

fish is eaten .(9).





39



IF I DON'T EAT MEAT, WHERE WILL I GET MY PROTEIN?

Protein is the most complex of al food elements, and its assimilation and utilization

are the most complicated. The hardest food for the body to break down is protein. When

protein food is eaten, it takes more energy for it to go through the process of digestion

than any other food. Protein is not built in the body by eating protein. Protein is built from

the amino acids in food. It must first be digested and split into its component amino acids.

The body can then use these amino acids to construct the protein it needs.

There are twenty-three different amino acids that have been discovered. Fifteen of

these can be produced by the body; and eight must be derived from the foods we eat.

That is why these eight are cal ed essential. There are no "essential" amino acids in flesh

that the animal did not derive from plants, and that humans cannot also get from the

plants they eat. If you eat fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains on a regular basis, you are

receiving al the amino acids necessary for your body to build the protein it needs.

Plant foods contain al the amino acids necessary to make protein, according to

Suzanne Havala, author of the American Dietetic Association's position paper on

vegetarian diets. She says that it is no longer necessary to consciously "combine" plants

to make a complete protein. Eating a variety of plant matter and getting enough calories to

satisfy energy needs is a better way to insure that a vegetarian diet is healthy. She also

notes that the belief that animal products are necessary for healthy eating is simply based

on a combination of culture and habit.

Americans eat too much protein, from 80 to 125 grams a day. The human body

recycles approximately 70% of its protein and loses about 23 grams a day, that's eight-

tenths of an ounce. It is lost through the feces, urine, hair, skin and perspiration. The RDA

requirement for protein is 56 grams a day, which, I believe, is stil too high. I think that 30-

35 grams a day is more than adequate. The Hunza people and half a bil ion Hindus eat

very little protein and they have no protein deficiencies. Studies show that excess protein

in the diet is harmful, contributing to kidney disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, heart disease,

cancer, etc.



3000 PHYSISCIANS RECOMMEND ELIMINATING MEAT AND DAIRY

Wel , scratch the milk and meat, a physician's group advises. The Physicians'

Committee for Responsible Medicine announced a new attack on the "Basic Four" urging

the U.S. Department of Agriculture to replace the 35 year old guide with

new groupings that concentrate on fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole

grains, and with meat and dairy products optional. Who is this Physicians1

Committee for Responsible Medicine? They are a group of 3,000

physicians dedicated to preventive medicine. Why have they

recommended such a drastic deviation from our traditional four food

groups? They are aware of the overwhelming evidence which demonstrates that plant

foods not only provide adequate, but also superior nutrition. As one of the members of the

Committee, Dr. Denis Burkitt, an Irish surgeon, states, "Knowledge of the diet and lifestyle

to which we are genetical y coded wil lead to the prevention of disease".





40





NEW FOUR PROPOSED FOOD GROUPS





Grains - Breads, pasta, cereal, corn, millet and barley are rich in fiber,

complex carbohydrates, protein, 7 vitamins and zinc.





Vegetables - All provide essential nutrients, including Vitamin

C, beta-carotene, riboflavin, iron, calcium and fiber.





Legumes - Beans, peas and lentils are good sources of protein,

fiber, iron, calcium, zinc and B vitamins.





Fruits â€“ Rich in fiber, Vitamin C and beta-carotene. Choose

whole fruit over Juices, which donâ€™t contain As much fiber.





41





MANâ€™S BASIC FOUR





MILK

VEGETABLES &



BREADS &

FRUITS



CEREALS





GODS BASIC FOUR





When you eat grains and vegetables, you are obtaining your food first hand; but when you

eat meat, you are getting your grains and vegetables second band. The only effect meat

eating has on health is that it deteriorates it.



42





GROUP II - ALL ANIMAL PRODUCTS, CHEESE, ICE CREAM, AND EGGS

(MILK COVERED IN ANOTHER CHAPTER )

Cheese has harmful effects on the body. As we know that milk

is harmful for one's health it Stands to reason that cottage cheese or

hard cheese would be doubly so, since it is concentrated and

fermented milk.

Rennet is used in the curdling of milk for cheese making.

Rennet is obtained from the whole stomach lining of calves, lambs,

kids or pigs. During the fermentation or curing of cheese, a mixed

group of microorganisms grows in the milk curd. Protein, fat, and carbohydrates are the

major nutrients affected during the curing process. The protein portion of cheese is

fermented to peptides, amines, indols, skateal and ammonia. The fat in cheese is

hydrolyzed to irritating fatty acids. The carbohydrates of milk, mainly lactose, is converted

to lactic acid by putrefaction. Most of the products of fermentation are toxic and irritating,

including the esters, the acids, and certain of the amines.

Polio viruses can survive in cheddar cheese throughout the life of the product. Most

cheeses are made of unpasteurized milk. Salmonel a, staphylococci, and brucel a

organisms can survive long periods in the cheese. A number of outbreaks of disease, as

wel as food poisoning, have been traced to cheese (10).





IGE CREAM AND ITS HARMFUL EFFECTS ON THE BODY

As we wel know, ice cream is usual y made from milk, sugar and eggs. We also

know that these are al harmful to one's health. But how many people are aware of some

of the other ingredients that are found in some ice creams? The

majority of ice cream manufacturers take ful advantage of the fact that

they are not legal y required to list al of the additives they use in

making ice cream. Operating on priorities of freezer stability, cost

effectiveness, and taste, they mix up concoctions of chemicals which

are packaged and sold as ice cream, but have no authentic claim to

the name. According to Arrow Magazine of September 1985,

laboratory analyses have found that the fol owing ingredients may

commonly be found in your cheaper grades of ice cream.

Diethyl glucol - A cheap chemical used as an emulsifier (agent used to hold two

ingredients together in Suspension) instead of eggs; identical y the same chemical used in

antifreeze and in paint removers.

Piperonal - Used as a substitute for vanil a; a chemical used to kil lice.

Aldehyde C17 - Used to flavor cherry ice cream; an inflammable liquid used in

aniline dyes, plastic and rubber production.

Ethyl acetate - Used to give ice cream a pineapple flavor; used as a cleaner for

leather and textiles, and its vapors have been known to cause chronic lung, liver and heart

damage.

Buytyraldehyde - Used in nut-flavored ice creams; also used as an oil paint solvent.



Amyl acetate - Used for a banana flavor; also used for oil paint solvent.



Benzyl acetate - Used for a strawberry flavor; also a nitrate solvent.





43





As Arrow so aptly puts it, "The next time you are tempted by a luscious

looking sundae or banana split or ice cream soda, think of it as a mixture of

antifreeze, oil paint, paint remover, nitrate solvent, leather cleaner and lice

kil er!" And if this is done to ice cream, what are they doing to color, flavor,

thicken and embalm hundreds of other foods on the store shelves?





EGGS AND THEIR HARMFUL EFFECTS ON THE BODY

Eggs are not a natural food, since they come from an animal source that contains

many diseases. Ordinary cooking of eggs, including boiling, frying and

baking, often fails to kil bacteria such as salmonel a in eggs.

A large number of al ergies are produced by the use of eggs.

Bladder al ergies resembling cystitis, urethritis, various skin

inflammations, gastrointestinal Symptoms, and even conjunctival

al ergies (reddening of the eyes) occur as a result of eating eggs. (11)

A cerebral food al ergy has been ascribed to eggs in which transient

loss of vision occurs, along with headache, hives, and partial amnesia. (12) Eggs are very

high in cholesterol, which leads to heart attacks and strokes. There is more cholesterol in

three eggs than there is in 2 pounds of hamburger; eggs account for over 1/3 of al the

cholesterol eaten in America. For optimum health we need to eliminate eggs from our diet,

and let eggs do what eggs were created for: to hatch baby chicks.





GROUP III - CHOCOLATE, BAKING POWDER AND SODA ARE

COVERED IN OTHER CHAPTERS





GROUP IV - SPICES ARE HARMFUL TO THE HEALTH

Spices have varying quantities of irritating chemicals in them. Al three types of

pepper (red, black, and white) have been shown to cause hemorrhaging

in the stomach. According to scientists at the University of Texas, black

pepper and turmeric alter cel s permanently. Turmeric causes breaks in

chromosomes in such a way as to alter the normal cel 's ability to

reproduce itself "Curry and other hot spices can cause damage to the

kidneys, particularly kidney stones." (13)

There are various condiments and spices that contain acids or volatile oils that are

potential y harmful to the kidneys. These include vinegar, black pepper, ginger, al spice,

mace and cinnamon. Some additional spices, which are irritating to the body and should

not be used, are: nutmeg, cloves, anise seed, caraway, chili powder, curry powder,

mustard, hot paprika, poppy seed, etc.





44





GROUP V - REFINED OILS

Oils are harmful to the body. Most plant foods contain very little fat, however,

modern food technology has made it possible to chemical y remove these

natural fats and process them into oil. Twelve ears of corn are processed to

make one tablespoon of corn oil. During the processing al the good fiber,

vitamins, minerals, enzymes, etc. are removed from the corn, leaving

nothing but oil which is 100% fat. Oils of any kind, whether corn oil, olive

oil, safflower oil etc.are not natural and are harmful to the body.

Al refined fats are a burden to the body, they thicken the blood,

slowing down circulation which affects the heart and blood vessels. These oils contribute

to overweight, diabetes, and gal stone formation; and recent studies suggest they may be

involved in breast and colon cancer (14)



GROUP VI - ALL REFINED SUGARS COVERED IN ANOTHER CHAPTER



GROUP VII - REFINED GRAINS

Refined grains are harmful to the body. Grains are made in

such a way that the vitamins and minerals are carried almost

entirely on the outer layer. Mil ing removes this layer leaving a

white, easily ground central kernel, which is almost devoid of

vitamins and minerals. The central portion has the starch and the

protein, but both of these are more difficult to metabolize without

the accompanying minerals and vitamins.

The mil ing of wheat into refined white flour removes much of the fiber, 40% of the

chromium, 86% of the manganese, 76% of the iron, 89% of the cobalt, 68% of the copper,

78% of the zinc and 48% of the molybdenum. These are al trace elements that our body

needs. The mil ing process also destroys a large percentage of the vitamins. Bleaching is

yet another process that destroys additional vitamins and minerals in grain.

Natural grains such as whole wheat, barley, corn, mil et, oats, rice and rye are what

we need for proper nourishment. But when these are mil ed they are almost worthless.



GROUP VIII - ALL VITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS COVERED IN

ANOTHER CHAPTER



SIMPLE RULES FOR EATING NATURAL FOODS

Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and supper like

a pauper. Eat your meals at regular times; and between meals eat

nothing. It is best that five hours elapse between meals. Two

meals a day, breakfast and the afternoon meal are better than

three for those who have a slow metabolism, who are overweight

and who have sedentary Jobs or do very little physical exercise.

Late suppers, just before bedtime, are particularly harmful, as

much of the food eaten is stored as fat instead of used. For those

who eat three meals a day, the third meal should be a light meal
