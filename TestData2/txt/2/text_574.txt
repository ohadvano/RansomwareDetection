“Kill me?” I stutter.
“I promise you, if you get in my way and humiliate me again as you did in there, I'll kill you myself.”
I reach with both of my hands to stop Bane from strangling me. His figure goes all blurry, when suddenly his hand disappears from my throat. I fall to the ground like a rag doll on all fours, and start gasping for air.
I hear them arguing above me, but I can't make out a single word.
I look up with blurry eyes to see Kellan standing in front of me in a protective stance.
“He was killing her and you weren't gonna do shit about it! She's got nothing to do with the murders here!”
Ryder's head tilts to the side as he listens to Kellan, “You don't know that. Anyway, leave us. I need to have a little conversation with Alice. Alone.”
Both Silver and Bane snicker like hyenas as they run into the middle of the road.
“Kellan, leave. I'm not going to hurt her.”
