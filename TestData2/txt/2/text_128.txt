I feel Ryder's presence coming closer and closer just as he stops right behind me, I hear his breathing against my neck. “I hope you're not talking about who I think you are.”
When he places his hands on my hips, my breathing increases.
“What you did was unforgivable.”
Picturing Max's beaten face and him standing on crutches brings back the anger I had earlier today.
Ryder leans in close to my ear, his mouth slightly touching the top of my ear. “And I told you that I didn't do it.”
His whole body frames mine so perfectly that I lean slightly backwards into his tall frame. He leans forward, wraps his arm around my waist and pulls me tighter to him. I feel his warm, solid chest against my back.
“How do I know if you're telling the truth?” “Then, you'll just have to trust me.”
He rubs his nose behind my ear causing a shiver to run down my back.
I escape his hold. “Enough.”
