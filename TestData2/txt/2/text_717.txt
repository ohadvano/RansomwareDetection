The door surprisingly opens and the first thing I see is Sam's tear stained face with mascara running down both of her cheeks.
“You guys are so loud I couldn't even concentrate on crying anymore.”
I pull her into my arms. “You scared the shit out of me when I couldn't find you. I started thinking the worst.”
She steps away and wipes her eyes. 'Tonight didn't go as I'd hoped, but I just wanna go home and get the hell away from here.”
Kellan grasps a hold of her hands and smiles reassuringly at her. “Ignore Bane and what he said to you because he's like that with everybody. Like a girl such as yourself, he was probably intimidated by your beauty.”
Sam smiles back at him but says nothing in response.
Is that a blush!?
“I think someone needs to lay off the alcohol	”
The door on the other end suddenly slams open with Bane rushing down the stairs, yelling at Kellan to follow him.
