My blurry vision allows me to see a form entering the kitchen. The moment Sam sees me on the floor shaking uncontrollably, she screams so loud that it hurts my eardrums.
She crouches down in front of me. “Alice!?” She places her hand gently on my shoulder. “Please......help...me.”
I place my head on the tile floor to cool myself down.
“What do you want me to do!? Tell me how I can help you.” She cries.
“Get..Ry...Ryder. He can help.” Sam's already reaching for her phone.
I don't know why I asked Sam to call him, but what other choice did I have? Maybe with his guidance, he'll help me survive this change, but one thing is for sure that I can't take any more of this pain.
If this happens every time I change I don't think I'd have the strength to do it.
“It's happening! So, get your wolf ass to my house right now!”
She slams the phone into the receiver and rushes back to me.
