Jealous much?
Ryder just stares at Silver. “What's it to you? Get over it.” She wheezes. “God, I was just asking. You used to tell me everything before she came along.” Silver sneers at me.
Ryder sighs in annoyance. “Silver, it's none of your business what I do.”
She looks at Ryder in confusion. “Why are you being like this?”
“Like what?”
“Like I don't mean anything to you anymore. She's only been in your life for a week and you're acting like she's more important to you than your own pack. It makes me angry that she's more of a top priority to you than I ever was, and I've been in your life for a long time!”
“Maybe that's because I care about her more than I ever cared for you.”
Silver looks as though she's been slapped. “What did you just say?”
From the corner of my eye, I see Kellan shake his head in frustration, unlike Bane who hasn't looked away from the TV.
