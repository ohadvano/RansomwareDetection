The moment we reach Sam's garden, Ryder releases me and backs away. By the time Sam joins us, Ryder has shifted back into his human form, wearing only his trousers, he looks down at me with a frown on his face.
“Turn her back!” Sam snaps.
He turns to her with a snarl. “Don't tell me what to do.” 'Turn her back now!”
Ryder ignores her and crouches down beside me.
I'm too weak to move from my position on the floor, and I think he knows that too.
I lie on the floor and close my eyes, I don't know how but I feel my body suddenly changing, and it does so without any effort. I'm aware that I have no clothes on and that Ryder's sitting next to me, but I no longer care about looking decent for anyone.
“Move!” Sam nudges Ryder out of the way and places a fluffy blanket over me.
I gather the strength to sit up from the floor and wrap the blanket around myself.
I look at Sam to see her eyes welling with tears. “Alice?”
