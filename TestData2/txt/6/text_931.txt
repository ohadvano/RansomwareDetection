Now, for beating up your precious friend, if I remember correctly, Kellan and I were at the diner right after you left yesterday. And for Bane?” Ryder shrugs. “He doesn't give a shit about anybody but seeing as he doesn't know what the hell you're talking about, then I guess you're at a loss here.”
He turns away from me with Bane on his heels.
Kellan remains looking at the ground. “You really think we'd do something like that?”
“Kellan, I don't know what to believe right now, but if you saw the state Max is in then you wouldn't know what to think.”
“Alice, we don't just go around beating people.”
“Then, how do you explain Max's injuries? Did you know that he's on crutches?”
Kellan's voice starts to rise. “So, you think that we did it? If you do then you obviously don't know who we are.”
“Then why would he accuse you three and lie to me?” Kellan shrugs. “You're asking the wrong person.”
I remain silent.
