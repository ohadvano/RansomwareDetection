
The drive to the school takes about twenty minutes. The silence in the car gives me the time to think to myself about the last couple of days. I think about the day Terry's body was found and almost losing Sam tonight, and I honestly believe that this day couldn't possibly get any worse.
When we get to school, the car stops just outside the entrance, 'I won't be long.' I unbuckle the seatbelt and open the door.
“Sam's mum told me that her keys might be in her locker considering they weren't found anywhere near the car.”
I nod in understanding. “Okay.”
“Do you want me to wait for you here?”
She's most likely really tired from work so I shake my head. “No, it's okay, go home and rest.”
“I'll see you at home.” She waves and leaves.
I wave back, walk up the steps and into the school. The doors are surprisingly still open at this hour, maybe a few teachers are still here doing last minute preparations for tomorrow.
