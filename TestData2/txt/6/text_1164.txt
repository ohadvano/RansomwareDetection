I look at the clock and see that it's past nine.
Teachers aren't usually late to lectures so it's kind of unusual for it to happen to Mr Thompson, because he's never late.
At exactly 9:15 the door to the classroom opens and in walks Mr. Thompson with another student.
Holy...
He has a chiselled shaped face with hooded grey warm eyes. Lips full and firm with spotless porcelain skin.
Golden wispy, untamed thick hair, his body tall and lean. He's wearing a denim jacket on top of a white t-shirt.
Skinny jeans and light brown work boots.
“Good morning class, I apologise for being late. I'd like to introduce everyone to our new classmate. This is Max Fields, and he'll be joining our class so please make him feel welcome.”
I hear people talking under their breaths while Mr. Thompson speaks quietly to Max. I can hear the girls fangirling behind me and I can just imagine that every guy in this classroom thinking they've got competition.
