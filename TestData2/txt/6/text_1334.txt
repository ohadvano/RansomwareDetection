He simply just shrugs. “Maybe I just heal quicker than others. Maybe I know how to look after myself after being in a fight.”
“Enough of the lies, Max.”
Max leans forward. “I'm not lying to you, Alice. You were there with me that night Ryder and I fought. You helped me when everyone else just stared and laughed at the new kid getting the crap beaten out of him. But not you.”
“Are you trying to avoid answering the question?”
“So what if I am? Are you going to call Ryder and ask him to beat the answers out of me?”
I scoff. “Of course not. Violence doesn't solve anything. If anything it makes things worse.”
“I couldn't agree more.” Max stays silent for awhile then sighs. “So, what's your next question?”
“You haven't answered this question.”
He frowns. “I did answer it. Did I not tell you about how I recover so fast? But seeing as you chose to ignore that, then I suggest that we're done here.”
