When I reach the spare bedroom, I see that Sam's given me something to wear for bed. I remove my clothes, put on the sweats and the vest then get into bed. The moment my head hits the pillow, I feel my eyes grow heavy, and soon find that I can't keep my eyes open.
Chapter 12

It's the last day of the week, and I couldn't be happier that it's finally Friday. This week has been beyond crazy, and I'm ready to put this week completely behind me.
When Sam comes to wake me up at 8, I get up from the bed, take a shower and wear the clothes that Sam has provided me with. I put on black skinny jeans and a band t-shirt that I'm unfamiliar with.
When I come downstairs, I see that Sam's mother has prepared us both breakfast.
“Morning Alice, did you sleep well?”
She grabs the steaming kettle and pours the hot water into three mugs.
I smile as I make my way to the table. “Morning Sally. I actually slept better than I thought I would.”
