The room's silence is interrupted with more intense sounds of my bones breaking, making me have this urge to let go. The bones in my face hurt so much that I can't stop the tears from falling.
Sam struggles in Ryder's hold.
“Let me go to her! She's struggling!” Sam screams.
Ryder grunts as she elbows his chest. “She's doing what needs to be done!”
When I feel the bones start to change the shape of my face, I go to scream but it's not a scream that leaves my mouth.
What does leave my mouth is a loud piercing howl that's probably loud enough to scare the living creatures nearby, and the urge to burst comes almost unexpectedly.
I feel like a bomb is about to go off inside me, and then it happens.
I'm standing on all fours; body perfectly formed into a wolf.
My wolf instinct has taken over my entire body, and I'm left speechless. I'm looking at myself at a distance in Sam's floor length mirror, and all I can do is look at myself.
