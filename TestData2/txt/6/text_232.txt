Before Ryder has another chance to slam Max against the wall again, I approach both men and separate them.
“Now, before this gets out of hand, I think it's best if I speak with Max alone.” I glance briefly at Ryder.
His head swings to me. “Over my dead fucking body.”
I stand in front of him. “I know what I'm doing. So, go and wait for me in the car.”
Ryder stares at Max with his fists clenched. “Answer every question she has for you, otherwise I'll be coming for you, and believe me when I say that you won't like the way I do things.” With that, he storms out of the house leaving me and Max alone.
I can feel from inside that she hates being here even more than I do, but I pray to the heavens that she won't do anything reckless.
Stay calm.
“Remember when you told me that nothing's going on between you two? I find that really hard to believe.”
I sigh. “Can we just get this whole thing over and done with?”
