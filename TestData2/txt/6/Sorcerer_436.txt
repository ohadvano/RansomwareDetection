“So,” the serpent said, “this is the lowly human who wishes to get inside my womb?”
Kiran glanced over at Gatril and wondered what the bosdrake could’ve told the lamia. He brought his eyes back to the lamia and said, “My name is Kiran Kehomba. I’m a young sorcerer in training. Great serpent, I wish to receive some of your queex so I can complete a spell. I’m ready to do anything you desire.”
“Is that so?” she said. Half her body slithered off the rock and wound its way around Kiran. His muscles felt almost weak against her muscles, even though she was careful not to touch him. “What makes you think I need anything from a human, other than to put him in my stomach?”
Kiran’s said, “Well…besides eating, what else do you like, great serpent?”
“My name is Scalian,” she said.
“Yes. Right. Scalian.” Kiran looked at Gatril again, who urged him to go on. “Well Scalian, I can give you anything you want besides a human to eat. Like the best sex you ever had, for example?”
Scalian frowned. “…Is that all?”
Kiran fumed. He climbed out of her coils and stood a distance away. “Look here,” he said, “my plan was to attack you while you were sleeping, but I chose not to. I’m trying to be nice. Just stop being mysterious and tell me what you want already?”
But to Kiran’s surprise Scalian laughed, a raspy one. She turned to Gatril and said, “I guess you were right. He isn’t a sexplorer.”
“Wait, you were testing me?” Kiran scratched his head.
Scalian said, “Yes. I hate humans who try to establish their dominance over everyone else. If your friend hadn’t convinced me otherwise, I would’ve already eaten you.”
“Okay…” said Kiran. “Then, will you give me your queex?”
“I will,” said Scalian. “But I won’t have sex with you,” she showed Kiran her long tail. “I use this when I get lonely. I’ll pleasure myself and provide the queex to you.”
“Oh,” said Kiran. “That’s good news.”
“However,” Scalian began, “I will need something to stimulate me. You and your friend will have to mate in front of me to get me properly aroused.”
“Whoa,” said Kiran. “I don’t think I can do it in front of someone else.”
Then Gatril hugged Kiran’s arm and said, “Oh, stop being so shy. I thought you said sorcerers are willing to do anything to get what they want?”
Kiran remembered his words clearly, and decided this wasn’t worth walking back on his resolve. “Alright. I’ll do it.”
“Good,” said Scalian. “Follow me to my burrow.”
The lamia slithered off into the vegetation. The human and bosdrake followed behind, careful not to trip over her elongated body. Scalian eventually got on all fours and crawled into a hole in the ground big enough for a cow to fit through.
Kiran and Gatril crawled through the dark, cool tunnel, with Kiran’s small lantern as their guiding light. The path eventually ended in a vast circular space, which despite Scalian’s size, was big enough that she only occupied one third of it.
Upon entering into the serpent’s chambers, Gatril began to strip. “We better get started.”
Kiran took off his clothes under the watch of Scalian. She was able to contorts her body so that her lower half with her legs, vagina and anus rested before her. Kiran handed her a jar, instructing her to pour her fluids inside it when the time came.
Gatril took Kiran’s hands, bouncing on her feet and jiggling her breasts. “So you want me to go first or you?”
“Let’s do it together,” Kiran said, getting on his back.
Gatril stooped over his face, stroking his erect manhood. She turned to Scalian with a seductive grin. The other reptile began to tickle her vulva with her tail and fingered her anus.
Kiran grabbed Gatril’s bottom and buried his face between her butt-cheeks as his frisky tongue eagerly wiggled inside her, soaking up all the seeping moisture. Gatril took hard licks of the tip of his member, each causing the boy to twist his toes. Gatril swallowed his penis, bobbing her head slowly, forcing all of him into her throat.
Scalian stuck her tail into her sufficiently moist passage, poking against her cervix with thrusts that made her tense. “Hey…you two…switch now…”
Kiran lifted Gatril off his face, and Gatril spat his penis out of her mouth. She turned around and positioned her vagina over his lap. She sat, slowly guiding Kiran inside her, making both of them moan. Scalian made sounds of euphoria as well.
Gatril grinded rhythmically on top of Kiran, increasing her speed and the intensity. Both of them winced each time Kiran slid deeper into her. She moved fiercely now, both of them wearing intense expressions.
Scalian bit her lips as she thrusted her body parts inside her. Her ears filled with the moans of the two. Fluids seeped out of both ends; where her vagina produced queex, her anus produced smek, however she concentrated more on milking more of her queex for the young man. 
Kiran grip Gatril’s waist and thrust his hip like a piston. Her muscles clenched vice-like, but he kept going like a rocket, creating unbearable friction that had them wincing and bearing their teeth at each other, locked in a battle. Scalian’s body gyrated in coils as the pleasurably waves spread through her like an intoxicating high.
With such intensity among them, it was no surprise when they climaxed simultaneously in a chorus of screams and sighs. Scalian brought the jar to her leaking vagina as she trembled, filling it to the point where it overflowed onto the floor of the cavern.
Gatril sighed and leaned over Kiran’s face as both caught their breath, drenched in sweat. They kissed, gently. They chuckled, and kissed again. 
Gatril got off him, dripping his seed onto the ground. The bosdrake said to Scalian who was lying down, “Are you finished?”
