I look inside Sam's locker in search for her keys but come up empty handed. I check again to make sure that they're there but her keys are nowhere to be found. I close the locker and turn to leave when I see what appears to be a single light ignited in a classroom.
With light footsteps, I draw nearer to the classroom and open the door when I notice that this classroom is familiar.
Who could be here at this hour?
I jerk in surprise when a voice brings me to attention.
“Looking for these?” Sitting in his chair holding a chain of keys on the end of his finger is Mr Edmund.
I peer at the keys he holds. “Are those...Sam's keys?” “Indeed.” He sighs “Kids these days, so irresponsible.”
I frown, confused on why he has her keys. “Why do you have her keys?”
“They merely came into my reach.” He twirls the keys around his fingers and stands. “I presume that you're here to collect them?”
“That's right...”
