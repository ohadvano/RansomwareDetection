INVASION OF NORTH AFRICA

President Antivon is in southern Israel with his troops. He wants to personally oversee the invasion of his next prize, which will be Africa. He sees the Pyramids as part of the energy source for the harmonic convergence of the universe. To him they are aligned in a precise way to collect and disseminate the energy of the universe to a god, and that would be him. As it was for the Pharaohs, so it would be for him. He was their heir. He desperately wanted to "own" the Pyramids, and the rich mineral resources of Africa along with them.
The Western Alliance forces based in Jerusalem headed south into North Africa. The African nations were no match for the combined military forces of the West, and fell easily one by one. Egypt, Sudan, Libya and Ethiopia fell first, all within a week. After a short rest for his troops and new supplies, Antivon was preparing to order his forces further south into central Africa. He felt the power of the Pyramids flowing through him. He was invincible.
But unexpected news of a massive Eastern Alliance army marching west toward the Middle East reached him. At the same time, when the Northern Alliance saw the Eastern Alliance headed for the Middle East, they sent their forces southward to cut them off. The Southern Alliance forces from Middle East countries had already made a surprise advance on Israel, and were now at the border of northern Israel, leaving their own countries undefended. The armies of the world were all headed toward Israel.
Infuriated, Antivon ordered his combined Western Alliance military forces to turn around and head north at full speed to prevent the Northern, Eastern, and Southern Alliances from trapping his army in Africa. His forces drove hard, and within two days the bulk of his forces had exited Africa into southern Israel. The three other Alliances were all within a couple days of entering Israel from various directions, with the Southern Alliance already massed at the border waiting for the proper timing to cross over.
Jill Steiner had been reporting on the invasion of Africa, and now turned to covering the invasion of the Middle East by all four world Alliances. The stage was set for Armageddon. She quotes from the Old Testament:
Daniel 11:40 “[King of the West – Antichrist] will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood. 41 He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon [where Jews are in supernatural hiding] will be delivered from his hand. 42 He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape. 43 He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Cushites in submission. 44  But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many. 45  He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain [Jerusalem]. Yet he [Antichrist] will come to his end, and no one will help him.”
Satellite video shows the armies of the world all headed toward northern Israel. The Western Alliance is headed northward, having just departed from Egypt into southern Israel. The Eastern Alliance is shown headed through northern Iran and about to enter Iraq, while the Northern Alliance is headed south through Turkey and will then make its way through Syria. The Southern Alliance army is in Jordan on the border with Israel, having left their own countries unprotected as the Eastern Alliance storms through. They should all converge within the next few days. The destination for each one of them is northern Israel. They could not attack southern Israel and Jerusalem directly because the Western Alliance is too strong there.
Within the next several days the armies will all meet at the Jezreel Valley in northern Israel to do battle on the wide Plain of Esdraelon, near Megiddo, just south of Nazareth. The valley has become better known by a Hebrew and Greek word compilation combining "har" and "Megiddo," which means the "Hill of Megiddo," forming the word "Armageddon."  The stage is set for the bloodiest battle in all human history.
CHAPTER 33
PREVIEW OF TRUMPET #7 -- WOE #3

With Armageddon and the Second Advent of Christ close at hand, Jill Steiner is in her news studio telling her audience what is coming next.
Jill: "Six Bowl Judgments and six Trumpet Judgments have been completed. There are seven of each, so one Bowl and one Trumpet remain. Recall that the first six Bowls were inserted in between the sixth and seventh Trumpet Judgments, which is the “Third Woe” which is yet to come. The Third Woe includes events just prior to and during the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. So the Third Woe includes the last Trumpet and last Bowl. In other words, all that remains is the Grand Finale, a combination of the seventh Bowl and seventh Trumpet Judgments."
After a brief pause Jill adds "I can't believe I just said all of that."
Jill continues: "The armies of the world have gathered to attempt to destroy Israel and the Jews, but instead have ended up facing each other at Armageddon. It is at this point when the Lord will return. The Second Advent is not so much a single event as a series of events which occur as Jesus Christ returns and completes the task of cleansing the earth from evil in preparation for His rule during the Millennial Kingdom. His first task will be to destroy the assembled armies which have invaded Israel.  Jesus Christ will very soon return to earth at His Second Advent, deliver His people who are under siege in Israel, destroy the armies of the four Alliances which are massed at Armageddon, and then assume His rightful place as Ruler of the earth."
Jill introduces her studio guest: "I have invited Professor Heathrow, Professor of Biblical Ancient Civilization Studies at the University of Southern California, to explain what the Bible says is about to happen during this Grand Finale. Welcome back to the program. Professor Heathrow, according to the Book of Revelation, Armageddon is only days away. Tell our audience what to expect next."
Professor Heathrow: "I described the timing issue on your show over 3 years ago, so let us review.  The Bible tells us the Tribulation is seven years long consisting of two equal sections, each exactly 1260 days long.  Bible years do not match our current calendar years, since the ancients measured years by the moon, and a year was 360 days long, which was twelve complete moon cycles.  Of course, our solar years are 365 days plus one extra day every four years.  So 3 1/2 moon-years is 360 x 3.5 which is 1260 days.  But days are days, and the Bible says the Tribulation will last 2 x 1260 equals 2520 days.  That is 37 days short of seven solar years, since we had 2 leap years since the Vanishment.  Therefore in solar years the Tribulation will last a total of 6 years 10 months and 24 days.  That means the Second Advent of Jesus Christ is just 5 days away.  And Armageddon happens when the Lord returns."
Jill: "So Professor, we are just 5 days from Armageddon?"
Professor Heathrow: "Correct. Five days and no more. We will start with an overview of what leads up to Armageddon and the Second Advent, and then cover the supporting verses from the Bible in detail to understand why we know these things. Jesus Christ will return to earth when Satan's four human armies are amassed in Israel, forming a battle line from the north at Armageddon, going southeast along the Jordan River Valley into southern Jordan, and extending back over to Jerusalem and into southern Israel. These armies are intending to destroy each other, and also the Jewish believers in Israel. At the northernmost part of the battle line in north Israel is Armageddon (aka the Plain of Megiddo, Esdraelon, or Valley of Jezreel) where the bulk of the four armies will be located."
"In southern Israel the Jewish believers are fighting the Antichrist's forces. Some Israeli Resistance troops in Jerusalem will be cut off and in danger of being annihilated, but the Lord will cover the Antichrist forces with supernatural darkness for the last hours prior to the Second Advent, preventing the destruction of the Jewish believers fighting against him. This will be the second time this darkness is used by the Lord to create an impenetrable darkness where artificial lights will be of no use, so the unbeliever armies and their sophisticated weapons of war, many of which rely on using the electromagnetic spectrum such as fiber optics, microwave, GPS and other technologies, will be immobilized by it. Then the whole world will be darkened during the last day, and while it is still dark, without warning there will be blinding light and angelic trumpets, and the Lord returns to deliver His people who are in great jeopardy."
"Jesus Christ first comes down to southern Israel (Judah) to defend the Jewish believers there, since they are in the most danger once the supernatural darkness is lifted by the Second Advent. Then He will go to Jerusalem and literally stand on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem and split it in half with an earthquake, allowing the Jewish remnant of believers fighting in Jerusalem to escape using the newly formed valley through the middle of the Mount of Olives. As the Jewish believers are empowered by the Lord, they begin to wipe out the unbeliever armies in southern Israel, then these Jewish fighters come to the aid of those fighting in Jerusalem. The Lord also brings panic and confusion on the enemy forces, causing them to turn on each other. Once southern Israel and Jerusalem are secure, the Lord proceeds to work His way up from the south, wiping out the unbeliever armies amassed all along the Jordan border with Israel where the Jewish believers who had fled at the Midpoint of the Tribulation are in hiding.  He then goes up along the Jordan River, wiping out the forces massed along it. Finally, the Lord attacks the unbeliever armies of the four kings at Armageddon where they have gathered to fight each other."
"Upon seeing the Lord, these four armies stop fighting each other and turn instead to fight against Him. At that point they are annihilated by a single word from the mouth of Jesus Christ, the world war ends, and all Tribulation Bowl and Trumpet Judgments are complete. All elect angels and resurrected believers from Heaven ride along with Him, but do not participate in the destruction. The Lord needs no help, although He allows the Jewish believers fighting in and around Jerusalem to have their victory over the unbeliever armies which had sacked Jerusalem. The end of the world war sets the stage for Jesus Christ to claim His rightful position as ruler of the earth from Satan who usurped the position at the fall of Adam in the Garden of Eden.
Jill: "What are some of the supporting Bible verses for what you just described will happen?"
Professor Heathrow continues: "Daniel 11 reveals some of the maneuvering of the four Tribulation armies of the North, South, East, and West, which will all converge on the Middle East, and Israel in particular, to attempt to kill the Jews and fight the Lord as He returns:
Daniel 11:40 “At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him [the King of the West – Antichrist] in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him [the Antichrist] with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He [the Antichrist is now every “he”, “him” and “his” in these verses] will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood. 41 He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon [where Jews are in supernatural hiding] will be delivered from his hand. 42  He will extend his power over many countries... 44  But reports from the east and the north will alarm him [the other three Alliance armies advancing toward Israel], and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many. 45 He will pitch his royal tents between the seas and the beautiful holy mountain [Jerusalem]. Yet he [the Antichrist] will come to his end, and no one will help him.”
"Then the Book of Joel describes the return of the Lord and the destruction of the four armies massed at Armageddon:"
Joel 3:11 “Come quickly, all you nations from every side, and assemble there. Bring down your warriors, LORD! 12 “Let the nations be roused; let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat [near Jerusalem], for there I will sit to judge all the nations on every side. 13 Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, trample the grapes, for the winepress is full and the vats overflow—so great is their wickedness!” 14 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD [Second Advent] is near in the valley of decision. 15 The sun and moon will be darkened, and the stars no longer shine [on the day of the Second Advent].
Professor Heathrow continues: "As we have seen, just prior to the Second Advent there will be supernatural darkness over the entire earth. This worldwide darkness follows the darkness covering only the Antichrist's empire and military forces caused by the 5th Bowl Judgment."
Jill interjects to Professor Heathrow: "Professor, what does the Book of Revelation say specifically about the return of the Lord and Armageddon?"
Professor Heathrow: "Some of the important verses are as follows:"
Revelation 19:11 “I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war.”
"During the Second Advent of Christ, Jesus Christ returns as a Warrior-King to deliver His people, eliminate the degeneracy on the earth, further avenge the killing of believers during the Tribulation, and establish His Millennial Kingdom on earth. As Jesus said in the Book of Matthew, everyone on earth will see His coming:"
“For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 28  Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.  29  Immediately after the distress of those days “‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’ 30  Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven [after total darkness]. And then all the peoples [unbelievers] of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. 31  And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect [dead Old Testament and Tribulation believers resurrected] from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.”
"Zechariah 14 covers the battle in and around Jerusalem which is ongoing when the Lord returns.  The Israeli Resistance will be fighting the forces of the Antichrist.  The battle will not be going well for the Resistance fighters, and the Lord will turn that around:"
"Zechariah says: "Then the LORD will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights on a day of battle. 4  On that day [Second Advent] his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south. 5 You [believer Jews in Jerusalem] will flee by my mountain valley [pathway newly formed by the earthquake], for it will extend to Azel [outside Jerusalem city limits]. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come [Second Advent], and all the holy ones with him [all believers in resurrection bodies, and all elect angels]. 6 On that day there will be neither sunlight nor cold, frosty darkness. 7  It will be a unique day—a day known only to the LORD—with no distinction between day and night [supernatural darkness]. When evening comes, there will be light [at the return of Christ]. 	12
This is the plague with which the LORD will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. 13 On that day [Second Advent] people will be stricken by the LORD with great panic. They will seize each other by the hand and attack one another. 14 Judah [Jewish believers from outside Jerusalem] too will fight at Jerusalem.”
Professor Heathrow continues: "Zechariah prophesied about the Second Advent and how the very first act of the Lord will be to help the Jews fighting in southern Israel (Judah), followed by deliverance of the Jewish believers trapped in Jerusalem. As a result these Jews will become empowered to defeat the attacking army of the Antichrist during the time of the Second Advent:"
“Then the LORD will appear over them; his arrow will flash like lightning. The Sovereign LORD will sound the trumpet; he will march in the storms of the south, 15 and the LORD Almighty will shield them. They will destroy and overcome with slingstones. They will drink and roar as with wine; they will be full like a bowl used for sprinkling the corners of the altar. 16 The LORD their God will save his people on that day.”
"The Jewish believers in southern Israel will fight with extreme enthusiasm as the Lord shields them and also brings panic and confusion on the unbeliever armies. The Jewish forces are enabled by the Lord to accomplish incredible feats of daring, bravery, and skill as warriors. They will destroy the enemy outside Jerusalem, then will go do the same in Jerusalem. The Lord could do this Himself, but He allows the Jewish believers to have their own victory over their oppressors who have killed so many of their friends and compatriots.
Revenge belongs to the Lord, but He sometimes shares it for specific purposes. Zechariah continues:"
“The LORD, who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the human spirit within a person, declares: 2 “I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem. 3 On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves. 4  On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness,” declares the LORD. “I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations [supernatural darkness]. 5 Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the LORD Almighty is their God.’ 6  “On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume all the surrounding peoples right and left, but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place. 7 “The LORD will save the dwellings of Judah first [first act of the Second Advent is in southern Israel outside of Jerusalem], so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem’s inhabitants may not be greater than that of Judah [those Jewish believers in southern Israel but outside Jerusalem]. 8 On that day the LORD will shield those who live in Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD going before them [Jewish believers will be fierce warriors]. 9 On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem.”
"And finally Isaiah talks about Armageddon:"
Isaiah 34:1 “Come near, you nations, and listen; pay attention, you peoples! Let the earth  hear, and all that is in it, the world, and all that comes out of it! 2 The LORD is angry with all nations; his wrath is on all their armies. He will totally destroy them, he will give them over to slaughter. 3 Their slain will be thrown out, their dead bodies will stink; the mountains will be soaked with their blood. 4  All the stars in the sky will be dissolved and the heavens rolled up like a scroll [nuclear warfare among the four Kings' armies]; all the starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine, like shriveled figs from the fig tree. 5  My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; see, it descends in judgment on Edom [western Jordan], the people I have totally destroyed [where enemy armies are massed along the Jordan River Valley]...6 For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom [both located along the Jordan River Valley]...8 For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of retribution, to uphold Zion’s cause.”
Professor Heathrow:  "Isaiah goes on to say: “Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah [southeast of the Dead Sea in Jordan], with his garments stained crimson? [The Lord has annihilated the armies massed along the Jordan border with Israel] Who is this, robed in splendor, striding forward [to finish the task at Armageddon] in the greatness of his strength? “It is I [Jesus Christ at Second Advent], proclaiming victory, mighty to save.” 2 Why are your garments red, like those of one treading the winepress? 3 “I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath; their blood spattered my garments, and I stained all my clothing. 4  It was for me the day of vengeance; the year for me to redeem had come 	6 I trampled the nations in my anger; in my wrath I made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground.”
Professor Heathrow continues: "And finally from Joel again:"
Joel 3:16 The LORD will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem [during Second Advent]; the earth and the heavens will tremble. But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.”
"From these Old Testament passages we can piece together the path the Lord will take during the Second Advent.  There are probably at least 100 million unbelievers engaged in these battles when the Lord returns, and they will all be killed, starting with the Antichrist's forces in southern Israel (Judah) outside of Jerusalem, then those in and around Jerusalem, followed by the enemies of Israel massed along the Jordan border southeast of the Dead Sea (Bozrah), then finally the remainder at Armageddon.  The Lord accomplishes most of the slaughter of the unbeliever armies, but also empowers believer Jews to fight and defeat their enemies, especially in southern Israel (Judah) and around Jerusalem."
Jill: "So let me try to summarize, Professor. At the Second Advent Jesus Christ will engage in four separate battles, not just one battle at Armageddon in northern Israel. The four battles will be:
1)  Southern Israel, also called Judah: The Lord starts by delivering the Jewish believers fighting the Antichrist forces in southern Israel outside of Jerusalem. These Jews will be in immediate peril and must be delivered first.
2)  Then He goes to Jerusalem where He will stand on the Mount of Olives just east of Jerusalem and cause an earthquake, creating a valley through the Mount so that the Jewish believers trapped in Jerusalem will escape.
3)  After that, He goes to the border between Israel and Jordan along the Jordan River and destroys the Antichrist forces along that border and near Bozrah, Jordan -- also called Edom, Moab and Ammon -- where the Jewish believers who fled Israel at mid-Tribulation have been hiding.
4)  And finally Christ goes to northern Israel where the world's four Alliance armies are massed at Armageddon, and He destroys all remaining enemy forces of the Kings of the North, South, East, and West. So Armageddon is the Grand Finale."
Professor Heathrow: "Exactly right, Jill. Could not have stated it better myself."
Jill: "Thank you, Professor. We will be right back......" After a few seconds Jill realizes there are no longer any advertisements, and nothing to fill in the gaps. The news studio has devolved into just two people doing something because they want to. No one is getting paid to perform the work. There are no businesses supporting the news. There is no economy remaining, only the "cash market" where a few basic items are sold at very high prices.
Otherwise, everyone is just waiting, although most do not know what they are waiting for. But they wait anyway. LA has become an empty shell of its former self. Jill is surprised there is still electricity to power her show. She pulls out one of her last remaining bottles of water and takes a small sip. There are only a few remaining, and nowhere to buy more.
CHAPTER 34
THE TWO WITNESSES KILLED

Jill Steiner and Jack Ford have gone to a 24 hour format.  She takes short breaks and naps as she can, while Jack rolls video which comes in at a steady pace.  Her news is still number one in the world, but the world has a lot fewer people than it did a couple years ago.  She wonders how many are still watching.  It must be a large percentage of those remaining since video keeps coming in from all over the world.  It is far more than Jack can process.
Jill: "The world is within a few days of Armageddon. During these next several days, events will move very quickly, especially in Israel."
Producer Jack Ford tells Jill there is something happening in Jerusalem. He puts up live video from Jerusalem where Moses and Elijah are about to speak near the Temple.
Jill: "Let's look at the live video feed from Jerusalem shared by a viewer:"
Moses and Elijah are shown making their way to the Temple Square to address the crowd gathered there. Moses begins: "The end is near for the forces of evil. Our job here on earth -- our second time here -- is now finished. We will return to our home for now, and word of our deaths will be reported everywhere. This must happen. But we will return for a third time in a few days. Those of you who believe in the Lord will soon see this world changed into a paradise after the Lord returns and eliminates the forces of evil. For those who are not believers in the Lord, this is your final chance to believe in Him and accept the free gift of salvation provided through the Lord Jesus Christ. This is our final message."
After they finish, Jill reads from Revelation 11:
Revelation 11:7 “Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them. 8 Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city—which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt—where also their Lord was crucified. 9 For three and a half days some from every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial. 10 The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.”
As Moses and Elijah finish speaking, a dark shadowy figure looms large above them. Moses looks up and declares "Do what you must! Your doom is very near, and you cannot escape it." With that, Moses and Elijah fall dead on the Temple Square.
The scene is viewed live around the world, and Jill's coverage is the most watched. As the two fall, the close-in crowd made up mainly of believers, becomes silent. But after a few moments those farther back break out in cheers, celebrating the death of Moses and Elijah. World leaders are quick to join the celebration. President Antivon, who is traveling with the Western Alliance military forces headed toward northern Israel, stops to provide an interview about the event with a local reporter. Jill picks up the live video feed and airs it on her show:
President Antivon: "This is a great day for people of the earth. These two have been a source of much pain for people everywhere. Their bigoted views that there is only one God were outdated. Now they are dead and gone. Good! I declare this a day of celebration, and extra rations will be provided, along with extra water. Our people have been starved and are thirsty because these two held back the rain from falling. Crops failed, and after the other disasters happened the rain was the only source of drinking water. We are finally rid of these two. So let the celebration begin!"
The LANX coverage shows video feeds of large crowds gathering in several locations around the world, celebrating the death of Moses and Elijah. After showing the celebrations, Jill reads to the audience from her book regarding the death of Moses and Elijah:
"As the Second Advent nears and their witnessing is complete, God allows one of the senior demons who had come out of the Abyss (Abaddon) to kill them both. Their corpses will lay in the streets of spiritually bankrupt and degenerate Jerusalem – like Egypt and Sodom of old -- for 3 ½ days and no one will bury them.	Their deaths will be a cause for great celebration among the unbelieving populace, especially among the false religious leaders who hated them for opposing their idolatry. But their celebration will soon turn into shock, panic and intense fear.
Jill tells her audience there will soon be an earthquake in Jerusalem. Within the hour it happens. As the crowds in Jerusalem are shown celebrating in the streets of Jerusalem, an enormous earthquake hits the city. There is severe damage, and buildings fall everywhere. Many are killed and injured.
After airing the video showing widespread destruction in Jerusalem, Jill reads:
Revelation 11:13 “At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.”
Then Jill reads from her book:
"At the time the two witnesses are taken up into Heaven, Jerusalem is devastated by a large earthquake and 7000 die instantly... Now these Jewish believers begin to celebrate, and are the ones who “give glory to the God of heaven.” More about the earthquake issue later. Some unbelievers convert due to the event, but most do not. This is essentially the last chance they will have to change their minds about Christ and be saved."
Jill ends with "It is three days until Armageddon and the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. We will see Moses and Elijah again on that final day.”
CHAPTER 35
THE BATTLE IN ISRAEL

Israeli Resistance fighters under General Dayan are on the move.  The forces of the Antichrist are determined to eliminate the Israeli Resistance, and they have set out to destroy the remaining two groups under General Dayan and General Gurian.  The secret location of the Israeli Resistance near Bethlehem had been discovered, so they were forced to relocate.  They chose a new location west of Bethlehem, and just 15 miles southwest of Jerusalem.  During the troop movement a portion of the Israeli Resistance forces under General Gurian went northward toward Jerusalem for supplies, but were cut off from returning to the main group and were forced to head into enemy territory on the outskirts of southern Jerusalem, where they engaged the Western forces.  The fighting was not going well for these Israeli Resistance troops in Jerusalem, but General Dayan could not get help to them.  He had his own issues with Western troops on his heels trying to catch up with him as he headed westward to set up a new encampment, which at this point seemed unlikely to happen.  There seemed to be no direction they could go without engaging Western troops.  Both General Dayan's and General Gurian's Israeli Resistance troops were trapped.
The two groups of Israeli Resistance forces under the command of Generals Dayan and Gurian engaged the enemy as best they could. Mainly they tried to avoid head-on confrontations, and instead used short incursions to make small gains here and there. They fought the forces of the Antichrist bravely, but their prospects of getting out alive seemed slim, humanly, speaking. But they knew they would be delivered in just a few days.
Both Generals knew the Bible prophecies about the end of the Tribulation. Zechariah prophesied about the Second Advent and how the very first act of the Lord will be to help the Jews fighting in southern Israel outside Jerusalem, followed by deliverance of the Jewish believers trapped inside Jerusalem. As a result these Jewish Resistance fighters will become empowered to defeat the attacking army of the Antichrist during the time of the Second Advent. As Zechariah prophesied, Judah (southern Israel) will be besieged as well as Jerusalem. Then when all the nations of the earth are gathered against Israel "the Lord will return and strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness...I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations [supernatural darkness]." The Generals told their troops to watch for the supernatural darkness, which would blind the enemy forces but not the Israeli forces, and allow them to attack the enemy and overpower them while they are blinded.
The LORD will save those in southern Israel outside of Jerusalem first, then He will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem. The two Generals reassured their troops: "As Moses told the people of Israel when they were trapped against the Red Sea, and all seemed hopeless: "Stand still and watch the deliverance of the Lord!”
CHAPTER 36
THE SECOND ADVENT

In Jerusalem near the Temple the bodies of Moses and Elijah had been lying in the street for three days while many came to look and scoff and celebrate their death. The unbelieving world was glad to be rid of them. They constantly reminded them that their days on earth would be short, and then they would spend eternity in the Lake of Fire. World leaders saw the two as getting in their way. Their message was seen as no longer valid in a modern world.
The witnesses were despised, and the authorities would not let them be buried. They wanted the world to watch their bodies rot in the street where they had died.
Jill Steiner now remains in the studio 24 hours per day.  She does not want to miss a thing, so she sleeps in small segments at the studio.  She told her audience earlier this morning to watch the bodies of Moses and Elijah today, because they would see something spectacular.
And they did.
A viewer in Jerusalem who was an avid follower of Jill Steiner's news kept a live video feed going from just before sunrise. Of course, Jack Ford kept the video on screen full time, sometimes side by side with other video coming into the studio. In Jerusalem at sunrise, Moses and Elijah suddenly stood up. A few standing by cheered. They knew it was coming. But most were horrified to see the rotting corpses, which had been stinking from lying three days in the sun, alive and whole again. As the world watched Moses and Elijah, now alive again for a third time, the pair raised their hands toward the sky and departed upward in a cloud.
As the two were standing there, Jill read to her audience: "As it says in Revelation 11: “But after the three and a half days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them. 12 Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on.”
Jill continues: "Resuscitated once again, the two show the power of God to an evil world, then are taken up into Heaven as the world watched in disbelief and horror. That spectacular event is a signal that the seventh Trumpet is about to begin. They are resuscitated on the day the Lord returns. Today is that day, the Day of the Lord. The Second Advent of Christ."
Jill reads from her book, as she has done so often. It has never let her down:
"The Second Advent of Christ is the 3rd Woe and includes the seventh Trumpet and the seventh Bowl. The armies of the world will gather to attempt to destroy Israel and the Jews, and will end up facing each other at Armageddon, at which point the Lord returns. The Second Advent is not so much a single event as a series of events which occur as Jesus Christ returns and completes the task of cleansing the earth from evil in preparation for His rule during the Millennial Kingdom...At the Second Advent He returns to deliver the earth from Satan's rule and arrives as a Warrior-King, judging the guilty and avenging the death of those believers killed by these evil people, and destroys the armies attempting to slaughter Jewish believers in Jerusalem and throughout Israel. His warrior role is primarily aimed at the final defeat of Satan and his demons, but degenerate mankind will join Satan’s cause, making them also the objects of His vengeance."
Jill reviews the current status: "The Antichrist and his Western Alliance army has invaded Israel attempting to destroy it. God has also pulled the other three Alliance armies of the Kings of the North, South, and East into northern Israel to set up one final battle at Armageddon, and also to distract and frustrate the Antichrist's forces (King of the West) as they attempt to kill all remaining Jews in Israel. The Antichrist's armies are now split into four parts located in southern Israel, Jerusalem, the Israel/Jordan border, and the Jezreel Valley in northern Israel.
Jack Ford shows video from southern Israel where Western Alliance forces have been trying to wipe out the Israeli Resistance forces under Generals Dayan and Gurian, who are bravely fighting the Western Alliance forces. President Antivon has given his hardened troops orders to wipe out all Jewish fighters, and take no prisoners. The battle was not going well for the Israeli Resistance. It was at this hopeless point when the darkness came, and the video turned blank, but the audio remained.  Jack was confused for a moment, but then Jill explained to her audience:
"We are now seeing the second supernatural darkness supplied by the Lord to shield his people. It affects only the Western Alliance forces while the Israeli Resistance forces will be able to see clearly."
Back in southern Israel General Dayan recognized what was happening, and it was just as Zechariah had prophesied. His troops could see clearly, but the Western Alliance forces of the Antichrist were blinded by the darkness. He ordered his troops to attack. This was for Jerusalem. This was for the imprisonment of Jews captured and sent to concentration camps. This was for revenge.
The tide of the battle turned, as the blinded Western Alliance forces could not see or detect the Israeli Resistance troops as they engaged them. These were the hardened evil forces which had ransacked Jerusalem and taken their fellow Jews into captivity, sending them out of Israel into concentration camps.  The Israeli Resistance forces under the command of Generals Dayan and Gurian are fighting with great enthusiasm as the Lord shields them while the blinded Western Alliance troops mostly fight each other because the Lord brought panic and confusion on them. The Jewish forces are enabled by the Lord to accomplish incredible feats of daring, bravery, and skill as warriors. They will first finish the task of destroying the enemy outside Jerusalem, then will go do the same inside Jerusalem. The Lord could do this Himself, but He allows the Jewish believers to have their own victory over their oppressors who have killed so many of their friends and compatriots. Revenge belongs to the Lord, but He sometimes shares it for specific purposes.
It was as Zechariah had prophesied:
Zechariah 9:15 “And the LORD Almighty will shield them. They will destroy and overcome with slingstones. They will drink and roar as with wine; they will be full like a bowl used for sprinkling the corners of the altar. 16 The LORD their God will save his people on that day.”
Jack Ford then runs another video of satellite footage showing the four Alliance armies are in place in the Jezreel Valley of northern Israel. There does not seem to be much movement, as all sides seem to be waiting for something to happen.
Jill:  "The stage is set, as it says in Revelation 16.
“Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.”
"While we are waiting for that Grand Finale, let me provide an overview from my book The Future Times which has served us so well over the past seven years:"
"At the Second Advent, Jesus Christ will return to earth when Satan's four human armies are amassed in Israel, forming a battle line from the north at Armageddon, going southeast along the Jordan River Valley, and extending to Jerusalem and southern Israel. These armies are intending to destroy the Jewish believers in Israel, many of whom are trapped in their last remaining stronghold in a portion of Jerusalem. At the northernmost part of the battle line in north Israel is Armageddon (aka the Plain of Megiddo or Esdraelon; Valley of Jezreel) where the bulk of the four armies will be located. The Jewish believers fighting the Antichrist troops in Jerusalem are cut off and in danger of being annihilated, but the Lord covers the Antichrist forces with supernatural darkness for the last several days prior to the Second Advent, preventing the destruction of the Jewish believers fighting against him. This will be an impenetrable darkness where artificial lights will be of no use, so the unbeliever armies and their sophisticated weapons of war, many of which rely on using the electromagnetic spectrum such as fiber optics, microwave, GPS and other technologies, will be immobilized by it. Then the whole world will be darkened during the last day, and while it is still dark, without warning there will be blinding light and angelic trumpets, and the Lord returns to deliver His people who are in great jeopardy. Jesus Christ first comes down to southern Israel (Judah) to defend the Jewish believers there, since they are in the most danger once the supernatural darkness is lifted by the Second Advent. Then He will go to Jerusalem and literally stand on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem and split it in half with an earthquake, allowing the Jewish remnant of believers fighting in Jerusalem to escape using the newly formed valley through the middle of the Mount of Olives. As the Jewish believers are empowered by the Lord, they begin to wipe out the unbeliever armies in southern Israel, then these Jewish fighters come to the aid of those fighting in Jerusalem. The Lord also brings panic and confusion on the enemy forces, causing them to turn on each other. Once southern Israel and Jerusalem are secure, the Lord proceeds to work His way up from the south, wiping out the unbeliever armies amassed all along the Jordan border with Israel where the Jewish believers who had fled at the Midpoint of the Tribulation are in hiding. Finally, He attacks the unbeliever armies of the four kings at Armageddon where they have gathered to fight each other. Upon seeing the Lord, these four armies stop fighting each other and turn instead to fight against Him. At that point they are annihilated by a word from the mouth of Jesus Christ and the world war ends, and all Tribulation Bowl and Trumpet Judgments are complete. All elect angels and resurrected believers from Heaven ride along with Him, but do not participate in the destruction. The Lord needs no help, although He allows the Jewish believers fighting in and around Jerusalem to have their victory over the unbeliever armies which had sacked Jerusalem. The end of the world war sets the stage for Jesus Christ to claim His rightful position as ruler of the earth from Satan who usurped the position at the fall of Adam in the Garden of Eden."
Jill is reporting as the scene unfolds:
Jill: "The world's four great Alliances are gathered together for battle at a place called by many names.  It has been called the Valley of Jezreel, the Plains of Esdraelon, and the Valley of Megiddo.  It is otherwise known as the ancient site of Mount Megiddo, translated as "Armageddon."  It is an eye shaped valley 25 miles long and about 6 miles wide at the center. The pupil would be the city of Afula.  At the eyelash area is Nazareth, the boyhood home of Jesus Christ.
"Is it only a coincidence that the world has long viewed "Armageddon" as the ultimate battle leading to total destruction? I think not. The boy from Nazareth, who became the Lord of the Universe, is coming home."
Jill continues: "Friends, let me be very clear. If you are not a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, you are on the wrong side of history. The forces gathered together at Megiddo are about to be wiped out. All of them. In one instant. The Lord is coming back. He will destroy the forces gathered at Megiddo."
"The Bible says "every eye will see Him." We are very close to that moment. The "Great Tribulation" is about to end, and it will end with the slaughter of evil. If you are on their side, you will not be delivered. I do not have anything else to say to you. I have said what there is to say...so we now wait for the return of the Lord."
With that said, Jill looks at the video screen and waits. The screen shows the forces of the world milling around, seemingly waiting for someone to give an order. The world waits. No one does anything except to watch and wait. Most of the world's people are starving, thirsty, sleep-deprived, and have very painful red sores, now thoroughly infected from the endless scratching. There is no economy. There are no jobs. There is no recreation. But believers are doing well because of divine protection, although everyone suffers from the effects of the disasters and judgments. But those who took the Mark suffered just as unbelievers did.
While waiting, Jill Steiner wants her audience to know that for believers, the future is very bright:
"In summary of what the Millennium will be like, it is the Kingdom which Christ will rule for 1000 years, with His throne located in Jerusalem.  It will be a time of perfect environment on the earth.  All Jews will be regathered into a much larger nation of Israel.  Jerusalem will be raised up as a mountain higher than any other on earth.  We see that after the Tribulation the Lord will heal the earth since it will be in terrible shape.  The destruction which occurred will be repaired, and the earth will also be changed such as the flattening of mountains, few islands and so forth.  Satan and fallen angels will not be on the earth to try to influence man and world events.  Humans in resurrection bodies will be on the earth as rulers over the humans who are living out their natural lives.  Elect angels will also live on the earth.  Plant life will be restored and also tamed.  Animals will no longer be wild or eat each other.  The seas and sea life will be restored and will thrive.  The sun and moon, afflicted during the Tribulation, will be made whole again.  Barren land and deserts will bloom.  The earth will be very friendly to mankind and will easily provide much bounty."
Producer Jack Ford tells the staff to keep the live video feed from Jezreel on screen. An hour passes, and then another. The screen shows the forces continuing to mill around. It is now almost sunset in the Jezreel Valley.
Suddenly a bright flash of light occurs in the atmosphere circling the entire earth. It is seen around the world. In the atmosphere above Israel there is much activity, looking like an army of clouds moving quickly from place to place, first to southern Israel, then far south Israel, and then above the Jordan River. At that point the army of clouds moves up along the Jordan River toward northern Israel.
Jill reads from her book:
Isaiah 63:1 “Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah [southeast of the Dead Sea in Jordan], with his garments stained crimson? [The Lord has annihilated the armies massed along the Jordan border with Israel] Who is this, robed in splendor, striding forward [to finish the task at Armageddon] in the greatness of his strength? “It is I [Jesus Christ at Second Advent], proclaiming victory, mighty to save.” 2 Why are your garments red, like those of one treading the winepress? 3  “I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath; their blood spattered my garments, and I stained all my clothing. 4  It was for me the day of vengeance; the year for me to redeem had come 	6 I trampled the nations in my anger; in my wrath I made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground.”
Joel 3:16 "The LORD will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem [during Second Advent]; the earth and the heavens will tremble. But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.”
These Old Testament passages show the path the Lord will take during the Second Advent, starting with the Antichrist's forces in southern Israel (Judah) outside of Jerusalem, then those in and around Jerusalem, followed by the enemies of Israel massed along the Jordan border southeast of the Dead Sea (Bozrah), then finally the remainder at Armageddon and anywhere else in Israel.
The armies of Heaven are the "clouds" which can be seen above Israel. It includes all elect angels plus those believers who were taken up at the Rapture nearly seven years ago. Those taken up in the Vanishment have returned. The returning believers are in their final status as eternally sanctified in resurrection bodies and each one is more powerful than any angel ever was, including Satan, yet they do no fighting. Only Jesus Christ has earned the right to be the Judge and to execute these intense judgments.
Revelation 19:15 “Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. “He will rule them with an iron scepter.”  He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. 16  On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.”
Isaiah 34:1 “Come near, you nations, and listen; pay attention, you peoples! Let the earth  hear, and all that is in it, the world, and all that comes out of it! 2 The LORD is angry with all nations; his wrath is on all their armies. He will totally destroy them, he will give them over to slaughter. 3 Their slain will be thrown out, their dead bodies will stink; the mountains will be soaked with their blood. 4  All the stars in the sky will be dissolved and the heavens rolled up like a scroll [nuclear warfare among the four Kings' armies]; all the starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine, like shriveled figs from the fig tree. 5  My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; see, it descends in judgment on Edom [western Jordan], the people I have totally destroyed [where enemy armies are massed along the Jordan River Valley]. 6 The sword of the LORD is bathed in blood, it is covered with fat—the blood of lambs and goats, fat from the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom [both located along the Jordan River Valley]. 7  And the wild oxen will fall with them, the bull calves and the great bulls. Their land will be drenched with blood, and the dust will be soaked with fat. 8 For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of retribution, to uphold Zion’s cause.”
The Israeli Resistance fighters under General Dayan have completely defeated the Western Alliance forces of the Antichrist in southern Judah, and enter Jerusalem to help General Gurian's forces trapped inside the city. They merge their forces just as a great earthquake occurs, splitting the Mount of Olives and creating a new valley through which the Israeli Resistance forces escape out of Jerusalem toward the east.
General Dayan looks back through the newly formed valley to see the remaining Western Alliance forces enter the other end of the valley, and coming toward them. Once the forces are all inside the valley, the walls of earth from the Mount of Olives fall in on them and they are killed. Every last one of them.
The two Generals count heads as they make their final escape out of the newly formed valley. Not one has been killed or even wounded in all the fighting over the past 24 hours.  The troops look skyward to see the army of clouds proceeding northward.
General Dayan stops his troops and tells them:  "Today we have been given a great victory by the Lord.  It is He who delivered us in southern Israel today, and it was He who split the Mount of Olives for our escape.  It was He who covered the enemy troops with earth as He had covered the Egyptian army with the Red Sea during the time of Moses.  He then quoted from Psalm 21 "Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies; your right hand will seize your foes.
When you appear for battle, you will burn them up as in a blazing furnace. The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath, and his fire will consume them."
Jill continues reading from her book and quoting from the Bible to fill the time between events.
Matt 24:27 “For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man... 29  Immediately after the distress of those days “‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’ 30  Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven [after total darkness]. And then all the peoples [unbelievers] of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. 31  And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect [dead Old Testament and Tribulation believers resurrected] from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.”
Revelation 16:17 “The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, “It is done!” 18 Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since mankind has been on earth, so tremendous was the quake. 19 The great city [Jerusalem] split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed... 20  Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found. 21  From the sky huge hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds, fell on people. And they cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because the plague was so terrible.”
"After the 7th Bowl is released, the phrase “It is done!” is stated by the Lord from the throne room in Heaven. This is the final Bowl Judgment before the Second Advent of Christ.
Tremendous earthquakes, huge hail, and devastating natural disasters torment the remaining unbelievers around the world.  The huge hailstones kill many unbelievers, destroy their homes and other structures, and cause widespread panic.  Again, believers are spared from these judgments unless they take the Mark of the Beast.  Jerusalem is split into three parts by an earthquake, allowing the Jewish believers in the city to flee to safety as they are fighting the armies of the Antichrist who is attacking Jerusalem (Zechariah 14:4-5).  “No earthquake like it has ever occurred since mankind has been on earth” describes its intensity.  Many other major cities also collapse during the massive earthquakes.  Islands cease to exist from all the tsunamis and explosive volcanoes set loose by those earthquakes.  Mountains are leveled worldwide.  All of this sets up changes in the landscape for the Millennium, when the earth  will be leveled as mountains fill in the valleys setting the stage for perfect weather.  (Isaiah 40 - 64)"
Revelation 19:11 “I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war. 12 “His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself. 13 He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God. 14 The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean. 15 Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. “He will rule them with an iron scepter.”  He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. 16 On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.”
Revelation 19:17 “And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair, “Come, gather together for the great supper of God, 18 so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and the mighty, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, great and small.”
There is about to be a great feast for the vultures. This is literal slaughter of the human unbeliever armies of Satan, resulting in an enormous number of dead. It is the first stage of removing all unbelievers from the earth. The Millennium will start with only believers on the earth under the rule of Jesus Christ.
Jack Ford has kept his "Armageddon Cam" video, as he called it, going full time for the past 24 hours.  Suddenly he tells Jill that something is happening there, and it needs her attention immediately.  The video from the Jezreel Valley shows the armies of the four Alliances are all looking skyward.  The army of clouds appears on the video over the Jezreel Valley.  The forces of the four world Alliances all turn their weapons away from each other, and upward toward the cloud army.  And then there is a single bright flash, like the sun glistening off the blade of a highly polished and sharp sword.  In an instant there are two million dead bodies lying where the four armies had stood just moments earlier.  Jill thought to herself: “That was almost anticlimactic.”  But then the video showed two figures who remained alive and standing.  These two would get special treatment.  They were the Antichrist, and his False Prophet.
Jill reads of their fate:
Revelation 19:19 “Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army. 20  But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed the signs on its behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur. 21  The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.”
"The King of the West, also known as the Antichrist, and his False Prophet were at Armageddon, along with the Kings of the North, South, and East.  The armies of the four Alliances were all killed by the Lord except that the Antichrist and False Prophet were not directly killed, but instead were kept alive so they could be thrown alive into the Lake of Fire. These two have become the very first residents of that eternal Lake of Fire, which will eventually replace the current Hell.  These two evil dictators will be its only residents for the next 1000 years.  Obviously being “thrown alive” into the Lake of Fire is a far more tortuous outcome."
Jill continues: "Now that the Antichrist and False Prophet have been eliminated, all Jews everywhere will now return to Israel. This is the regathering which was promised to Abraham long ago. As a matter of fact, I need to pack for the trip."
Jill concludes her final broadcast: "Jesus Christ has put an end to evil dictators, war, disasters, hunger and endless misery.  He has been revealed as the only true King and the only true Lord.  He will now sit on His Millennial Throne and rule over the renewed earth, which He will heal. In fact, the paradise is already starting to emerge. Look outside, it is like a super- Spring emerging after a long dark winter of evil. And the Antichrist is gone -- now that's a Vanishment! We started seven years ago with one, and we end today with another. The Antichrist has vanished.  Forever.  The nightmare is over.  The Millennial Kingdom of our Lord is here!"
"This is Jill Steiner, and Jack Ford, signing off from Los Angeles, California, USA.  We hope to be reporting from Jerusalem shortly.  And there will be no more daily reading of long lists of horrible disasters.  I hope to bring you wonderful stories of our Lord's reign and the resulting perfect environment, abundance, beauty and grace -- for the next 1000 years!”

FOR BELIEVERS IN JESUS CHRIST THERE IS NO END 




Vanishment & Tribulation

About the cover:
The cover depicts the Resurrection (Rapture) of the Church when all believers who are alive will be taken up into the atmosphere by the Lord Jesus Christ, given eternal bodies, and then taken into Heaven. Their human bodies on earth will disappear when this happens as the Bible says:
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.  And so we will be with the Lord forever." (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17)
"We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed -- in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality."  (1 Corinthians 15:50)

PREFACE

This novel is closely based on Bible prophesies about the Resurrection or "Rapture" of the Church and the seven year Tribulation which follows. In that sense this is not a work of fiction. However, fictional characters and situations are intertwined with the actual order of prophesied Biblical events to make those events come alive and be more understandable to the Reader. The primary purpose is to inform about what the Bible says, but it is also meant to be interesting and entertaining, because the Bible is not boring.
When the Rapture of the Church happens it will be generally seen as an unexplained "Vanishment" by unbelievers of that time as they attempt to explain it away. With all believers removed from the earth, the remaining restraints on evil will be greatly diminished, and the world will be ready to accept extreme evil in ways not otherwise possible. But many who are left behind will be awakened by the Rapture and will believe in Jesus Christ as their Savior. These new believers will see it for what it really is, a wake-up call. Jews will especially be awakened to the reality that they missed their prophesied Messiah. A period of Tribulation will then engulf the world for 7 years and the forces of evil personified by the Antichrist will severely persecute the new believers. Many will be killed -- martyred in great numbers because of their faith. The thin veil of civilization will be ripped apart from top to bottom as the basest instincts of sinful mankind are unleashed. This seven year period of Tribulation will be the most evil of all human history, and as a result God will allow judgments and disasters of types and magnitudes never before seen on the earth.
The Tribulation will be a time of evil lawless dictators who destroy individual freedoms and trample the rights of anyone they do not agree with, especially the new believers.  The forces of evil will have their seven year revelry, but God will avenge the persecution of His believers. Evil will have its last stand, but Truth and Justice will triumph as the Lord returns at the end of the Tribulation to destroy the forces of evil and institute His 1000 year Millennial reign under perfect environment on this same earth, which only He can put in place.
But first, the Vanishment awakens a world in slumber.	and triggers the seven year countdown to Armageddon.
CHAPTER 1
THE VANISHMENT

Sometime in the future.....
Veteran SkyCopter News pilot Tommy Jackson slowly turns his helicopter southward as he heads back toward the Los Angeles airport.  No sudden turns, since in the seat beside him is newly-minted reporter Sean Thompson, on his first helicopter reporting trip.  Tommy has cleaned up after newbie reporters before, so he has learned that lesson well.  After a quick run northward over the San Gabriel mountain range to obtain aerial video for an upcoming report on the Angeles National Forest, the SkyCopter News crew is heading back to LAX airport to refuel and get their afternoon assignment.  As they pass over the last of the mountain peaks, the LA basin scene comes into full view, and today they can actually see all the way to the ocean.  Pilot Tommy Jackson has done this many times, and always looks forward to the moment he crests the last peaks of the mountain range and sees the spectacular LA basin  view.  As he does, this time the scene is disturbing.  Wait -- why all the black smoke, and in so many locations?  It was just normal LA traffic when the crew left the airport only an hour ago. On closer inspection they see the nearest freeway, the I-210, is shut down in both directions, with multiple accidents, some vehicles burning.  As they gaze further into the LA basin and head toward downtown, the scene becomes clearer as one of complete chaos.  Tommy turns  on the police scanner which had been turned off while filming, and it is erupting with chaotic calls for assistance.  Tommy pushes the helicopter to maximum speed while reporter Sean Thompson reaches to turn on his outboard cameras, and then relays an urgent message to the LANX News producer:  "This is SkyCopter 1 -- quick, you need to air this live video right now!"
In the studio LANX News producer Jack Ford takes one look at the footage coming in from SkyCopter 1 and shouts into the earpiece of on-air news anchor Jill Steiner, who is doing a live interview with a local politician.  "Jill, cut off the interview -- urgent breaking news.  Cover the SkyCopter footage I am putting up now.  Do it right now."  Jill stops talking in mid-sentence as footage appears on the screen behind her.  She gasps as she struggles to orient to what it shows.  The live helicopter video pans across the Los Angeles basin showing traffic snarled, many overturned cars, freeways clogged, black smoke rising from multiple areas, police cars and ambulances everywhere.  There is mass chaos and city highways are at a virtual stand– still. The producer tells Jill to let the SkyCopter News reporter cover the story.  She shakes her head in disbelief and then her veteran anchor skills kick in. She instinctively goes into her breaking news routine.
LANX anchor Jill Steiner: "We have breaking news, and are going straight to our SkyCopter Reporter over the I-5 freeway north of downtown....Sean, the video is frightening...what is going on?"
SkyCopter Reporter Sean Thompson's voice comes on-air as he struggles to decide what to cover first: "Jill, we have an enormous mess down there. The freeways are absolutely shut down. Accidents are everywhere, and many vehicles are burning. Hundreds of accidents, maybe over a thousand, we just don't know. Multiple ambulances are moving as best they can, and if they can, but it won't be enough. The police and EMS crews report they are overwhelmed and a number of their own vehicles have crashed. I see at least one gasoline tanker on fire on I-5 just north of downtown. There are reports of two Metro Rail train accidents. Police are reporting that many of the accidents were caused when vehicles just seemed to crash without any reason, and all over the city. And another odd thing, initial reports state there are very few survivors of all the freeway crashes."
Jill to SkyCopter 1: "What happened, Sean?  That many vehicles don't just...um...crash, for...for no good reason..." Jill stumbles as she tries to find the right words while still watching the live video feed.  "What else do you see?  And what do you mean, very few survivors?"
SkyCopter News Reporter: "Jill, it's just a mess, and I can't tell what is actually going on down there." Sean struggles to catch his breath...and also think of something useful to say. "Let me just say that we need eyes on the ground to tell both of us. We will try to get lower for a better view, but air traffic control is overwhelmed, and there is thick black smoke coming from the airport area. We are heading that way next to check it out."
"Give me just a moment" Jill says into the camera as she listens to her producer through her earpiece..."We are getting reports that this is happening all over the U.S. Something very strange is going on here and elsewhere....so now we will...hold on a moment..." Jill says as she presses on her earpiece "...and now my producer is telling me this may even be a worldwide event. What the hell is going on? OK, we are cutting over to our Washington D.C. news affiliate DCNX as they report on this breaking news..."
DCNX News feed starts while their reporter is in mid-sentence: "...and so it seems there are mass casualty events occurring all over the U.S. But they are spread out, not localized as in a terrorist attack. Additionally, reports out of several European countries show it is a global event, but exactly what has happened, no one seems to know. The main issues reported so far have been mass vehicle accidents, including numerous car and commercial truck accidents, several airplane crashes, freight train derailments, and a Washington Metro train accident in the underground near downtown. Emergency services and first responders are overwhelmed and cannot handle the multiple incidents. It is mass chaos out there. In related news, several well-known people seem to be missing. Requests for a statement from the White House have so far gone unanswered. There seems to be an unusual amount of confusion over there and staffers refuse to say anything. Whatever this is, whether some new form of diffused terrorism or mass technological glitches or whatever else, I can only say that the scale of this disastrous event has never before been seen.  Back to you in the studio.	"
As the DCNX report ends, LANX anchor Jill Steiner comes back on-air: "As we have just seen, this is not a local LA event. And whatever it is, it is very big and highly unusual. We going to a break to try to sort this out as best we can, and will be right back "
The Producer keeps the SkyCopter News live feed going, with the SkyCopter News crew now over south LA as Jill goes off air. Jill and her news staff discuss the events and the limited information available. A couple of her staff members who were seen just before the breaking news are now missing from the studio. Jill looks at their boss and tells him "Either find them or fire them. This is no time to be running off without permission!"
News Producer Jack Ford relays to Jill that police radio scanner reports indicate the cars that crashed had no drivers. Jill tells her news staff "get an automated driver-less car expert on the line and tell us if there has been some type of systemic software malfunction. And get a terrorism expert in here ASAP for me to interview. Also check for experts on any other types of technological glitches that might explain some of this. Just get me some people to interview. Now!!!"
Several news staff members report cell phone coverage problems as Jill is forced to go back on air without much information. She wings it and stalls for time. All she can do is cover what she sees on the SkyCopter News video, which shows a scene of freeways at a standstill, multiple smoking accident scenes, emergency vehicles which cannot move through the stalled traffic jams, and thick black smoke coming from the airport which has been confirmed as an inbound airplane crash just short of the runway on the beach along the ocean.
As Jill talks on-air about the live video feed from SkyCopter News she gets new inputs from her Producer, then tells the audience: "We now have reports that many of the cars were NOT the driver-less models.  Also, many of the cars which crashed did not have a driver at the crash site.  What does that even mean?  Going now to our on-scene reporter Don who is near downtown and stuck on the I-10 freeway.  Don – what can you tell us?"
Don:  "Jill, I am not able to move my car out here since the I-10 is a parking lot.  But I ventured out on foot and have seen several crash scenes where there was no one in the car at all, and no one near them.  Driver-less or driver-controlled is not the issue here.  Many of these cars simply had no one in them at all when they crashed."
Jill: "I'm not sure I understand what you mean the cars had no one in them. You mean the people were thrown clear?"
Don: "No, no, no...Jill, there was no one anywhere near the accident scenes. Not in them, not around them, not thrown from them. There were no drivers found. Just clothing in the driver's seat, and shoes on the floor. Beyond that I have no explanation.  Some had passengers who survived but they report their driver just vanished...they were there in the car one moment, and then gone the next. Drivers disappeared, and then the cars crashed, or at least that is what I have heard from multiple crash sites I have personally seen. Very odd, but I am just reporting what I have heard and seen out here."
At LA Police HQ the Chief and his leadership staff are watching LANX news coverage while trying to figure out what is happening with their officers out on the streets. LA Police Chief Washburn is watching the news while also monitoring incoming reports from his officers. He asks his Watch Captain: "What have we got here? No drivers in the crashed cars? Are you kidding me?" As the Captain shrugs, Desk Sergeant Thornton breaks in: "Sir, it's just as reported. My officers on-scene are reporting no people in or around many of the crashed cars. Or if there are crash survivors, they were passengers, and were not driving at the time of the crash. So sometimes there was a passenger or two who survived, but no drivers were found.
Something very strange has happened here, Chief. One of our guys mentioned Revelation."
Chief Washburn: "Revelation? Revelation of what?"
Sgt Thornton: "Not of what. The Bible. The Book of Revelation. Sergeant Fowler used to talk about this at lunch. He said some day people would just disappear. Believers “gone to be with the Lord” he would say. He was supposed to be here at work today but he never showed up.
He's a very religious guy, and he is also never late to work."
Chief Washburn: "I don't care what he said, I need facts."
Sgt Thornton: "Well sir, then you tell me. All the officers who I know are Christians are missing. Some were out on patrol when their cruisers crashed, others did not show up for their shift, and some were at their stations and vanished. Reports say there were uniforms in seats of the wrecked police cars. That's what I know."
Chief Washburn: "I'm going out there to see for myself." He exits for his police helicopter which is already running and waiting for him. As they lift off Chief Washburn wonders to himself if his family is safe. How many families are asking that question right now? But he returns his focus to the task at hand. An impossible one, for certain.
Back at the LANX studio, on-air anchor Jill Steiner has been reporting for over an hour now. “We now have reports of multiple airplane crashes around the country coming into the studio, including the one here near LAX"...She pauses to listen to her earpiece	"My Producer says we have someone who will try to explain what is going on. Actually, not live, but an online video. Really? Well, if that's all we have, then OK. We don't have much else, so roll that video now.”
The online video starts playing:
"Sometime in the future people will be searching for answers, trying to figure out why millions of people suddenly vanished. People were there one moment and then just disappeared, while many others did not show up where they were expected to be.
Vehicles crashed and no driver was found, and these were not self-driving. Airplanes crashed and the pilot's body was not at the crash site. People just disappeared, mainly in areas where Christianity has been more widely accepted. Many will be asking: "Where did all those people go?" "Why did people just vanish?" "What happened to their bodies?"
I am the author of the book "The Future Times" and other books about the Bible. My books are free, just as salvation is a free gift from God to those who believe in Jesus Christ as Savior.  I am not selling anything -- I am merely providing information from the Bible, where the answers you seek were written over 2000 years ago.
This catastrophic event is called by various names, one is the "Rapture" which means carried away, but "Rapture" is not a Biblical word.  More precisely it is called the Resurrection of the Church, with the Church being all believers in Jesus Christ during the current Age of Biblical time. The Bible says believers are not given their eternal bodies immediately after death, but must wait with patience for a resurrection event to occur in the future.  For the Church Age all believers in Jesus Christ who are alive when the Resurrection occurs will be given an eternal resurrection body, which is why the bodies disappear on earth as the mortal takes on immortality.  At the same time Church Age believers who had died prior to the Resurrection are brought back from Heaven into the atmosphere and also given their eternal bodies.  These are immortal bodies far more powerful than the bodies of angels.  The Bible reveals this in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 which says:
"The Lord Himself will descend from Heaven with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. We who are alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will be with the Lord forever."
And 1 Corinthians 15:50 says:
"...flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed— in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.”
It is likely only believers will hear that "shout and trumpet" since it is intended to call them home, but possibly it could be heard more widely on the earth.
But why did this happen now? What does this mean? And what comes next? The short answer is: intense judgment is coming, and time is very short.
Let me provide the timeline:
1) This resurrection event ends the Church Age and begins a period called the Great Tribulation (a term from Revelation 7:14), namely a 7 year period of great judgments on the earth which will intensify during that time. It also starts a 7 year clock ticking toward the 2nd Advent of Christ and Armageddon.  The Tribulation is divided into two parts, each 3 1/2 years long.  The first part will be bad, but not nearly as bad as the last 3 1/2 years, which will be the worst period in all human history.
While that online video is rolling, the news crew talk among themselves: Jill: “We need someone to interview live."
Producer: "We can't seem to get any church leaders on the phone right now to talk with us. So we need to just keep this You Tube video rolling to give us time to sort things out."
The video continues rolling....
"The resurrection event leaves only unbelievers on the earth. For those of you who are unbelievers when the Rapture occurs, meaning you have never believed in Jesus Christ as your Savior, you have no more than 7 years remaining to live unless you become a believer in Jesus Christ. At the end of the Tribulation all unbelievers will die.  Every last one. But most will die before that time due to the magnitude of the coming judgments. But those who become believers in Christ after the Rapture and survive the Tribulation will go into the Millennium, a 1000 year period of perfect environment on this same earth, which will be healed by God after the devastation of the Tribulation. Those surviving believers will live for another 1000 years in a paradise on earth, so if you believe in Jesus Christ as Savior immediately after the Rapture, you might live another 1007 years since there will be almost no death during the Millennium.
But what will happen during the 7 years of the Tribulation?  During the first 3 1/2 years there will be increased warfare and economic disaster.  Some nations will take advantage of the Rapture to attack other nations due to the chaos.  Soon after, the Western nations will consolidate power under a new leader called in the Bible the Antichrist, an evil dictator disguised as a god-like savior of the world.  He will deceive the world and ascend as ruler over the western nations, first taking over three of them, then another seven will capitulate to him forming a multi-nation Western alliance.  He will display false miracles, and also appear to die, only to live again -- a phony "resurrection."  This Antichrist will even be treated as a god, and a statue of him will be put into the new temple in Jerusalem after the first 3 1/2 years have passed.
During the last 3 1/2 years the judgments on the earth will become nearly unbearable. People will die by the billions.  Yes, billions.  By the end of the Tribulation probably 90% of the population of the earth will be dead from the judgments and warfare.  These judgments during the final 3 1/2 years will be brutal.  There will be massive earthquakes, huge tsunamis, explosive volcanoes, fireballs from the sky, destruction of the worldwide food chain and water supply, widespread famine and disease, nuclear war, and other disasters, with judgment upon judgment, and the earth will become a stinking mess with very little food or drinking water.  These are not metaphors.  This will all be very real.  Misery and death will be the norm.  Israel will be attacked several times.  Then after seven years the armies of the world will meet at Armageddon where they will be destroyed by the return of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself at His Second Advent as He prepares to take over rulership of the earth, and then He will institute the Millennium.
Those who become new believers will be persecuted during the Tribulation as never before. Many will become martyrs, and this will become the primary reason for the judgments on the earth. Jews will generally lose their blinders about Jesus Christ and will accept Him as their Messiah-Savior in much greater numbers. There will immediately be 144,000 Jews who will see the Rapture for what it is, and will believe in Jesus Christ and then begin to evangelize the world.  Believers must resist the Antichrist and his Mark of the Beast system of economic and social control if they want to survive.  The faith of believers will be tested to the breaking point.  It must be this way.  The lost and dying world can only be evangelized by their suffering, but their reward will be great in Heaven.  Families will be ripped apart by the evil of the world.
But believers must study and follow the Word of God.
There will be some confusion about the Rapture, as many high level clergy in some established denominations will be left behind. These were not true believers, even if they were high-ranking leaders of their church denominations. A believer relies on faith in Jesus Christ to provide salvation through the work of Christ on the cross rather than their own work, while those who try to work their way into heaven actually reject the salvation work of Jesus Christ the only Savior. These so-called pious workers will be left behind since they did not accept salvation as a free gift but rather sought to work for salvation. And others who were considered very sinful people will be taken up to heaven, since they believed in Christ at a young age, but then departed from their faith later. Salvation is a one-time event, and it is permanent.
We do not know what will happen to children who are too young to have made a salvation decision. Will the children of believers who are taken to heaven also be taken? We do not know the answer, so that could go either way.
This has been a brief overview. For more detailed information you can read my book "The Future Times". This is not a commercial...I never sold any of my books, and I certainly do not need anything from you now. But people on the earth need truth from the Bible so that you may believe in Jesus Christ and have eternal salvation, which is available to you right now. The Bible says:
"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved"
"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast" and "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
However bad you think the Tribulation might be, it will be much worse. It would be wise to heed the Bible and accept Jesus Christ as Savior. Don't delay. 90% of the people on earth at the time of the Rapture will die in fewer than 7 years. Time is very short, severe judgment is at your doorstep, and then Eternity is forever. Choose wisely."
Camera crew motioning to Jill who is talking to her Producer: "Back live in 3, 2, 1. 	"
Jill: "That was an online video by a book writer talking about what he called "the Rapture of the Church" also known as the "Resurrection of the Church," and how -- as he says -- it would result in worldwide events like those we have been reporting. As the video said, the events are concentrated in the mostly Christian regions of the world, while other areas were mostly unaffected, or not affected at all. Take that for what it is worth. But still very puzzling. We have heard some reporters calling this a "Vanishment." Whatever you call this, we are obviously overwhelmed here as more and more reports are coming in to us of strange events and chaos in multiple locations around the world. Rapture? Resurrection? Vanishment?
We'll be back in just a minute	so stay tuned.”
CHAPTER 2
THE FALLOUT

In Israel, near the new temple recently built on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, a group of young Jewish men are talking among themselves as 24 year old Shem Kolb leads the discussion: “My Christian friend had often told me about this day.  It happened just as he said. He told me it would be the event which would cause many Jews to believe in Jesus Christ as their Messiah.  He gave me this Bible and asked me to read a passage from 1 Thessalonians:
"For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 17  After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. "
Shem Kolb continues: "My Christian friend had also said the Church Age believers would just vanish and be gone, their bodies missing, and people would wonder what happened. He said this would motivate evangelization especially among Jews as their blindness toward Christ as the Messiah would be lifted by the Rapture. I cannot get my Christian friend to answer my texts or posts where he always hangs out, so I assume he has gone to be with his Lord, as he had always said he would. It all seems very real to me right now."
A young man from the group asks Shem: "But what does that mean for us? What are we supposed to do?"
Shem: "My Christian friend also said 144,000 Jews would immediately believe in Jesus Christ then become evangelists who are set apart to evangelize the entire world.  It is very sobering to remember his words.  The Book of Revelation discusses these 144,000 Jewish evangelists in detail.  Here, let me read from Revelation:
"Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea: “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.” Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel."
"My friend said this means before the Tribulation gets really bad, and he told me it surely will, God calls out 144,000 Jews to be evangelists.  That will be necessary since all believers will be gone after the Rapture happens.  Therefore a new group of evangelists must come forward very quickly and fill the need.  That is what he told me.  What do all you think?"
Shem's Jewish friends agreed that all this seemed to be true. They agreed to meet back at the Temple Mount the next day to discuss what to do next.
Back in LA, LANX News anchor Jill Stein continues to provide fast-breaking updates on freeways which remain shut down, airplane crashes, widespread looting being reported, police unable to deal with all the calls, 911 is clogged, cell phone coverage is limited, people on social media looking for loved ones, etc.  After continually saying "More breaking news" she stops and asks herself "Why am I even saying the words "breaking news" anymore?"  She stops as her Producer is talking through her earpiece, and the look on her face is one of disbelief: "We are just now receiving a report...is that confirmed...that the President is missing?  He was last seen in the Oval Office reading through briefing papers and now he cannot be located.  Also just in to us...can this even be true?  We are being told that the Vice President cannot be located, either.  He was in his residence getting ready to travel abroad and now the security staff cannot locate him either.  So what does this mean for our national leadership situation?" Jill listening to earpiece 	"We are joining our LANX affiliate in Washington as an expert there tries to shed some light on this issue	"
LANX joins Wash., DC station affiliate DCNX as a Constitutional lawyer is speaking on air:
(TV feed cuts into the middle of expert talking)	"so as I was saying, if the President is deemed to be unable to fulfill the requirements of his office, in this case he is missing and cannot be located, the Vice President would normally take over. If the Vice President cannot be located to fulfill the functions as President, and so far he has not been, then the Speaker of the House would take over as Acting President. Someone must always be in the position as leader of the country and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. So as I understand it, the Speaker of the House is now on his way to the White House to be sworn in as Acting President. That is all we know right now. I'm sorry, but that is all I have to say, and I need to run to a meeting on this issue now..."
Reporters shout questions as the expert leaves in haste, and the local news station reporter comes back on air. TV feed cuts off and LANX on-air anchor Jill Steiner continues to try to make sense of what is happening for her viewers.
Jill: "Scary times. Is this the beginning of the End Times or is this all just random? Was the book writer correct about the Rapture or Resurrection or "Vanishment" as some others are calling it? Is a time of Great Tribulation just beginning? It is just too much to fathom all at one time." Co-anchor Sarah Boswell has now joined Jill at the anchor desk to help with all the fast-breaking status. Jill turns to Co-anchor Sarah: "But how could both the President and Vice President be randomly missing? As most viewers know, both have made their Christian faith a matter of public record, and their campaigns have emphasized it as an important part of what they believe and who they are as people."
Sarah agrees and listens to new inputs through her earpiece from the producer, then says "Breaking..." but catches herself and then simply continues "We have just received word that Speaker of the House Antivon is about to arrive at the White House, so we now re-join our Washington DC news affiliate for a report..."
Video begins of Speaker of the House Dan Antivon arriving by limousine at the White House. Reporters rush the car as the door opens. A crowd of news reporters are yelling questions with their microphones thrust forward in his face:
Speaker Antivon: "No questions please -- please, not right now. I need to be briefed on the situation and then I will address the nation."  He hurries inside amid a swarm of Secret Service agents and staff members as reporters are left behind. The DCNX news anchor comes on and reports "Speaker Antivon's Chief of Staff has informed us there will be a press briefing shortly after the White House meeting concludes. With both the President and Vice President missing, we can only conclude that Speaker Antivon will emerge from the meeting in charge of the country, at least for now. That is about all we can tell you at this point."
Inside the White House door the missing President's Chief of Staff John Breen is waiting and escorts Speaker Antivon into the Oval Office where the Supreme Court Chief Justice, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and several Senators and House Members are already assembled.
Chief of Staff Breen: "Mr. Speaker, we believe the President and Vice President are not going to be located. Those assembled here have discussed the issue and see no other option except to swear you in as Acting President. Chief Justice Robins concurs that this is the proper approach given the extremity of the circumstances going on in the world. Chief Justice Robins will now discuss the Constitutional issues with you.
Chief Justice Robins: "Since only the Vice President can automatically become President under an emergency succession situation, you would be sworn in today as "Acting President" until the Congress votes and finalizes the succession issue. Of course, the Speaker of the House is stated to be third in line under the Presidential Succession Act, so we are proceeding as it directs. If neither the President nor Vice President are located within a very short time, then Congress would need to vote on final succession and the Acting part will be dropped.
With that, Mr. Speaker, I will now administer the oath of office as the Acting President of the United States to you.  "Please raise your right hand.  Do you solemnly swear.	"
After the swearing-in is complete, Acting President Antivon exits the White House for the Rose Garden where swarms of reporters are gathered to interview President Antivon. He strides out to meet the assembled reporters and states only that he has just been sworn in as Acting President, and will soon give a speech to the nation. He then goes back into the White House without taking any questions. On-air reporters from the various news networks begin to try to explain to their audiences what is going on, but without much information. They relay that Speaker Antivon, now Acting President of the United States, will address the nation, likely later in the day.
Back inside the White House President Antivon meets with the former President's Chief of Staff John Breen, who begins the conversation: "Mr. President, I know that you were opposed to most of the former President's policies, but I will help you however I can during this transition. I and my staff are at your service."
President Antivon: "Assemble all current White House staff members immediately to start the transition process." Breen: "Will do, Mr. President.  I will round up the staff.  They are waiting for orders."
As John Breen leaves, President Antivon thinks to himself how he relishes being called "Mr. President" by the former President's Chief of Staff. Power is what he has always wanted, and it has driven every decision in his life. He is anxious to use that power to its fullest extent.
After several minutes, the staff is assembled in the West Wing. President Antivon enters the room and speaks to current White House staff members: "Your services are no longer required. You are dismissed. My Congressional House staff is now my White House staff." White House staffers look at each other in bewilderment and then shuffle out in disbelief as President Antivon takes all his House Speaker staff members aside and installs them as the new White House Staff. He then addresses his new Presidential staff: "This has been a fortuitous set of circumstances, and now I have the power to change the world. The Vanishment has cleansed the nation of many unwanted people who have prevented progress for a long time. It appears they were Christians -- good riddance. Their religion had no tolerance for someone like me. They held to their singular beliefs in only one God, and only one way to reach their God. They held to their Bible and guns and moralism, and stood in the way of the progressive agenda. Now they are gone, so we can move forward in a highly accelerated manner. And I do mean highly accelerated. We must not waste this crisis opportunity by slow action or timid policies. The harmonics of the universe have converged to give us this moment in time, and we must take advantage of what this creative force is offering to us. I see it as a sign that we are the ones the universe has been waiting for. We are the ones destined to heal the wounds it has suffered under capitalistic greed and excesses, and the moralism of Christianity. The universe screams out to us to save it.  We are the ones it has sent to answer that call.  Now, we will take every advantage, seek every opportunity, ignore any rule or law, and take extreme and bold actions to heal the universe which has suffered from so much harm done to it by humanity under millennia of Christian rule. From this moment on, there are no rules for us to follow except that we will push progressiveness to the maximum and we will not tolerate anyone who stands in the way. Now that the Christians are out of our way, we will make sure they stay out of the way. Permanently! I will be implementing every form of emergency declaration possible while there is chaos. The timing is perfect. We must seize this great opportunity and use it to our advantage. I was born for this day!" The staff breaks out in cheers of approval as President Antivon departs to the White House private quarters to work on his speech to the nation.
As President Antivon enters the private quarters, the belongings of the former President are everywhere. He yells down the hall: "Maid, or someone, anyone?" "Yes, sir?" a running staff member says. "Get this junk out of here! All of it! Now!" As staffers comply, President Antivon sits down and starts typing his speech.
A few hours later at LANX news:
Jill breaks in as the new Acting President is about to address the nation. "We will now join the news feed from the White House to hear from Acting President Antivon:"
Acting President Antivon addresses the nation from the Oval Office: "My fellow Americans. I come to you in a time of great turmoil. I have just been sworn in as your Acting President.
Despite the Vanishment our nation is secure and your government carries on without interruption....(he continues for five minutes). At this time I am declaring both Martial Law and a National State of Emergency which will allow me to have much greater powers to deal with this situation. All I can do is assure you that your government will continue to function and I promise you that we will get through this, whatever it is, together."
A Washington, DC reporter provides a report from the White House:
"We have just witnessed the swearing-in of a new Acting President under the most unusual circumstances possible. The President and Vice President were apparently part of the "Vanishment" as some are now calling it. What or why it happened is not yet clear. But the relatively obscure Speaker of the House who had only recently come to that position, and whose past is clouded in mystery, is now our Acting President. But where did he come from? What is his background? What are the underpinnings of his belief system? These are all questions which deserve answers. As for now, we just hope he is the right man for the job. Back to you in the studio."
Jill comes back on-air at LANX, and she has brought in an expert to fill in some details for the audience:
"Those are good questions posed by the DCNX news reporter. We have in our studio a political consultant who has worked with the new Acting President. Mr. Holland, you have worked with him, so what can you tell our viewers about his background, and what we might expect him to do? I mean, most people have barely heard of him. And now he is the Acting President at a most unusual time of crisis."
Joe Holland: "Well, Jill, he is an enigma. I have dealt with him on several occasions yet I still do not know what to think about him. He rose to power very quickly and out of nowhere, going from State office to Speaker of the House after a series of highly unusual circumstances, including a couple mysterious deaths which eventually were ruled suicides. He seems to have been launched out of a cannon into his current position, and it is especially significant that he is from the opposing party to the former President and VP, which changes the political landscape dramatically. He is a hard-core and committed progressive-leftist, and I mean extreme left, which makes him a political disrupter. He is an environmental activist, even to the point of worshiping nature, although he is otherwise an atheist. He brings a deep distrust of religion into the position, especially Christianity, something which brought him into conflict with both the previous President and VP. Acting President Antivon is extremely ambitious and even brash, so I would expect him to take full advantage of the crisis caused by the Vanishment. His eloquence can be riveting, which enables him to convince the masses to follow him. That is something very surreal about him, that he can be so convincing to great crowds of people. There is something "other-worldly" about it, and..."
Jill: "I'm sorry to interrupt, but you just said 'other-worldly'. What do you mean?"
Joe Holland: "I am not even sure what I mean. I suppose there is simply something eerie, even supernatural, about how he can sway people. They find him mesmerizing in a Svengali sort of way. Otherwise I just cannot explain it."
Jill: "OK, please go on, Mr. Holland."
Joe Holland: "Anyway, since he has now been catapulted to the highest office in the land, it is unclear how he will use his power to further his ambitions, but it is certain that he will use every bit of power he can accumulate to himself. I personally view him as someone who wants to accomplish big things. I mean really, really big things. World changing things. He is not a patient man, and will act quickly and decisively to put in place policies to carry out his aggressive agenda. I worry about what he might do under Martial Law emergency conditions, which gives him immense power. And one more thing I must add about him, he gives me a very uneasy feeling, especially his stare, which is unnerving. There is something about him as a person which I do not understand, but it leaves me feeling unnerved. He is a very different type of individual. Almost like talking to more than one person -- I mean it is like there is something inside of him which defies worldly explanation. That is the only way to say it."
"OK, thanks for those insights Mr. Holland." Jill says as she turns toward the camera: "We will seek to provide a more in-depth profile on Acting President Antivon and attempt to answer some of these questions about him as soon as we have more information to report. After a break we will provide an update on what has happened so far today. A most unusual day, indeed."
After a very long day which began with many millions of people simply vanishing, LANX anchor Jill Stein turns over anchor duties to Sarah Boswell who continues with the news, trying desperately to keep up.

That evening at her apartment, Jill Steiner has the news running in the background while she also reads a book she found on the internet called "The Future Times." It was the book mentioned in the online video which was aired on her news show earlier in the day. She reads to herself from the book:
"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, which are Dictatorship, War, Economic Disaster, and Death, will now begin to unfold.  These first four of seven Seals will reveal historical trends which will be pervasive throughout the entire seven year period of the Tribulation, which has just begun.  They reveal the trends which will occur in a very intense and sustained manner throughout the entirety of the Tribulation.  Later there will be specific Bowl and Trumpet judgments unsealed throughout the course of the Tribulation.  The Lord Himself, as Judge of the world, has broken open the 1st Seal."
Revelation 6:1 “I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, “Come!”
"Thunder in the distance warns of the coming storm. The gathering storm early during the Tribulation will be a set of extreme judgments on the earth, and the time for those judgments has arrived."
Revelation 6:2 “I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.”
"Seal #1 is the White Horse of dictatorship under the Antichrist who will strip mankind of their personal freedoms and force upon them a false satanic religion.  So-called “democratic” forms of government will be pushed aside and replaced by strong-armed dictators around the world.  The strongest of them will be the Antichrist, also called the Beast, or the Antichrist.  This man of Satan will appear very early during the Tribulation and deceive the masses into giving up personal liberties in exchange for a promise of collective security under his dictatorship.  The Antichrist will appear to be a leader on a white horse coming to the rescue, but instead he will be a force for great evil who enslaves millions of people.  Early during the Tribulation he will not be seen as a force for evil, and will use cunning speeches and selective warfare to gain his position, and then will assume dictatorship rule over a ten nation confederation.  Revelation 6:2 means “he conquers, so that he may conquer”.  This demon-possessed Antichrist conquers so Satan might gain power through him, and Satan will set him up as an idol to be worshiped by mankind.  So the white horse is dictatorship and loss of personal freedoms as a result of the Antichrist seizing power through conquest, which will continue and intensify throughout the entire Tribulation.  Once these first Seals are opened they reveal ongoing historical trend judgments, so once they begin, they continue throughout the entire Tribulation."
Jill puts down her book and thinks to herself about what happened today, as she tries to make sense of it all. So many horrible things occurred, and all at the same time. "What is the meaning of it, was this really the Rapture of the Church? Or some type of unexplained Vanishment as national leaders are now calling it? Can it really be the beginning of a period of Great Tribulation?" she asks of herself, with no answers.
As the day finally ends Jill is endlessly searching through internet news feeds and blogs.  A website has been set up to help those searching for loved ones who vanished, and she looks at the faces of those who were alive this morning, but now are gone.  The numbers are staggering, and estimated to be well over 100 million.  She falls asleep still wondering what it is all about...
In Jerusalem it is early morning, and the group of nearly a hundred young men have re- gathered on the Temple Mount to continue their discussion from the previous day. Shem Kolb, their de facto leader, asks for their attention as they draw near to listen to him. "Fellow Jews, we are at a crossroads. The issue has been made clear to us that we missed our Messiah Jesus Christ the first time around. We will not make that same mistake again. I ask you to join with me as new believers who will carry forth the message of the Messiah to our own nation Israel and also the entire world. The message of the Messiah must be proclaimed, and time is very short. All believers were removed from the earth by the Rapture, and now new believers must learn how to evangelize.  The Bible says the Messiah will return to earth seven years after the Rapture, and says there will be a core group of Jewish believers who must perform the task of evangelization.  We are the beginning of the 144,000 who will perform that task.  Are you ready?"  Cheers of agreement erupt among the group as these new Jewish believers eagerly await direction from Shem regarding their assignments.  As they prepare to depart, Shem asks them to quickly spread the message about what has really happened, and what it means.
Back at home on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Shem talks with his wife about what he has come to believe.
The morning alarm awakens Jill Steiner and her first thought is "Was it all a dream?"  She turns on the news.  No, it was real.  Day 2 is beginning.  She wonders to herself what today will bring as she hurries off to the studio.
Back at the anchor desk Jill begins her broadcast.  She had only recently been promoted to the position as news anchor of the LANX Morning Show.  It was quite a jump for someone only 27 years old.  Now she is reporting the biggest news in years, maybe decades.  It is only 24 hours after the Vanishment occurred.
Jill: "Good morning LA. We continue with news coverage of the Vanishment. There is a lot to cover but here is a very quick rundown on what we have learned so far:
1)  At approximately 10:20 AM yesterday the Vanishment occurred. People just disappeared. The numbers from around the world are estimated to be more than 100 million people.
2)  The US was hardest hit by the Vanishment, while it was virtually a non-event in the Middle East, Far East, and some portions of Africa. The numbers are highest in the south and southeastern United States.
3)  The cause is listed officially by government leaders as "an undefined Vanishment"
4)  The US President and VP vanished. The Speaker of the House was sworn in as Acting President.
5)  The people who vanished left behind their personal effects, namely clothing they were wearing, jewelry, glasses, phones, and so on at the point where they vanished.
6)  Nationwide, there were huge numbers of traffic accidents, a large number of airplane and train accidents, numerous industrial accidents, unattended critical infrastructure incidents resulting in power outages and countless other accidents, incidents and disruptions.
7)  Many people did not show up where they were expected. People on airplanes vanished and their clothing was left in the seat they had occupied. Numerous small stores were left unattended as owners or clerks did not return to close the shops. And other cases where people should have been in certain places but they were not, however their clothing was there in a pile.
8)  Some eyewitnesses saw people vanish and their clothing fall to the ground as they were talking to them. One person reported: "We were talking and suddenly there was only a pile of clothing where he was standing." Another eyewitness who was a passenger in a car which crashed said the driver was talking and in mid-sentence there was only a pile of clothing in the car seat, and then the car crashed."
9)  Most of those who vanished appeared to be Christians, however some clergy and high level church leaders remain. These are often from certain progressive denominations, but also some long established ones.
10)  The US Congress is in disarray as many Members are missing. There are not enough Senators to have a quorum for many types of voting. The balance of power in the Senate has also changed as the former President's party no longer has a majority of seats since it lost more Members to the Vanishment. This will likely allow Acting President Antivon to secure his power base more quickly.
There is much more, but that is a very quick rundown on what happened yesterday."
Jill continues: "So this is where we are just 24 hours into this phenomena, a Vanishment, or whatever it was.  We go now to where we began the reporting just 24 hours ago, to SkyCopter News reporter Sean Thompson who broke the story yesterday morning in the skies over the LA Basin.  Over to you, Sean:"
"Jill, that's right, just 24 hours ago our helicopter emerged over the San Gabriel mountain range to unveil a sea of chaos in the LA basin."  Sean reminds himself not to be overly dramatic.  "We witnessed clogged freeways.  We saw multiple burning locations, mostly traffic accidents, one airplane crash site, and some industrial accidents.  Now just 24 hours later, with the wrecker trucks having worked non-stop through the night, most freeways are at least minimally passable, although some bridges are closed for inspection.  Most people have stayed home at the request of the Mayor, and the new President has declared a state of emergency, both of which have helped ease the chaos. Essential services are getting back into operation, although slowly. Power outages remain a big problem. The city is returning to a minimally functional state, but only because most people have remained at home. From what we can see from the air, the city seems to have a surreal calm about it." Skip the drama, Sean reminds himself. "Reporting from Sky News, Sean Thompson reporting. Jill, back to you." Sean turns to pilot Tommy Jackson and says "I was a bit dramatic there." "Don't worry" Tommy replied, "for a newbie who was thrust into this yesterday on his first day, you have done just fine. It's not as though we were simply reporting on a fender-bender on the I-5 freeway and then went back to have donuts at the airport."
Jill: "We go now to our reporter Phil Stewart on the street in downtown LA for a walking view of the aftermath of the Vanishment. Phil, what do you see down there?"
"Jill, I have been out walking the streets of downtown LA, both yesterday and this morning. Yesterday I saw chaos as people were screaming that their loved ones, friends, co-workers, and other people had vanished. People were running and screaming in sheer terror and confusion. They had seen something normally reserved for a bad movie. Today it is much calmer, as the streets are mainly empty as people have generally remained home. A few homeless people have formed crude signs with the words "REPENT, THE END IS NEAR" on them. Nothing really new about that. But I have also seen several stores which were never locked up yesterday, and they remain open. A pile of clothes is generally found behind the counter, or elsewhere in those small stores. Very eerie.  Some of those stores have been looted, and looting is a real problem down here today. Police can't do much about it as they are overwhelmed. Just now I see several people running down the street with piles of stuff in their hands, yelling gleefully. I can tell you that I don't feel safe down here myself. The loss of order is just one of the disturbing issues we will need to consider as we move about the city.
Otherwise, given what we have been through during the past 24 hours, I can say that at least no additional people seem to have vanished today.  Jill."
Jill: "Thanks, Phil. We will continue to keep our viewers updated on events as they unfold. Back in just a minute..."
Over the next week, events continue to unfold on the world stage. Overall, the disruptions were confined to mostly Christian areas of the world, such as the US, Europe, and a few other regions. A couple small nations in central Africa were also hit hard. But the US was most severely affected, and was in a chaotic state. President Antivon was confirmed by Congress as President, which ended the "Acting" President issue. He appointed a political unknown as his VP who was previously the head of an environmental activist group. Martial Law continues in effect as President Antivon uses it as a means to implement aggressive political moves, and he signs numerous Executive orders putting controversial and far-reaching polices into effect without the consent of Congress. There is internal tension in the US due to the extreme measures being put in place by the new President. Dissent steadily grows as people see a loss of freedom setting in.
Jill Steiner is at home continuing to read "The Future Times." She does not yet know what to think about that issue. She never had any belief system outside of getting ahead as a reporter. It is what she had always wanted to do with her life. But she finds the book interesting, at least. She reads about what the Bible says will happen during the first half of the Tribulation:
"Now the Lord opens the 2nd Seal, the Fiery Red Horse of war.
Revelation 6:3 “When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!” 4 Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword.”
Seal #2 is the Fiery Red Horse and its rider.  This signifies four great armies which will engage in nearly constant worldwide war during the Tribulation, including the army of the Antichrist.  Despots seeking power will take peace from the earth, meaning a continuous world war affecting the entire earth.  The four spheres of power on the earth are the Kings of the North, South, East, and West, who will battle each other.  The resulting wars will include conventional, guerrilla, terrorism, and even nuclear war.
This is what was prophesied by Jesus just days before the cross: “You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end [Second Advent] is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.”  (Matthew 24: 6-7)
This horseman of war will be an historical trend, not a single event. There will be specific battles during later judgments, but the Fiery Red Horse means a world war will start almost immediately and wage during the remainder of the Tribulation. The Rapture will lead to great instability among the nations, and dictators will rush in to take advantage of the chaotic situation."
Jill did not realize it yet, but the world would soon see that the Four Horsemen had just arrived. Global war was at the doorstep. The first installment came quickly and unexpectedly.
