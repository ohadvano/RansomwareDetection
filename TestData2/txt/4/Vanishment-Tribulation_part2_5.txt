CHAPTER 1
THE VANISHMENT

Sometime in the future.....
Veteran SkyCopter News pilot Tommy Jackson slowly turns his helicopter southward as he heads back toward the Los Angeles airport.  No sudden turns, since in the seat beside him is newly-minted reporter Sean Thompson, on his first helicopter reporting trip.  Tommy has cleaned up after newbie reporters before, so he has learned that lesson well.  After a quick run northward over the San Gabriel mountain range to obtain aerial video for an upcoming report on the Angeles National Forest, the SkyCopter News crew is heading back to LAX airport to refuel and get their afternoon assignment.  As they pass over the last of the mountain peaks, the LA basin scene comes into full view, and today they can actually see all the way to the ocean.  Pilot Tommy Jackson has done this many times, and always looks forward to the moment he crests the last peaks of the mountain range and sees the spectacular LA basin  view.  As he does, this time the scene is disturbing.  Wait -- why all the black smoke, and in so many locations?  It was just normal LA traffic when the crew left the airport only an hour ago. On closer inspection they see the nearest freeway, the I-210, is shut down in both directions, with multiple accidents, some vehicles burning.  As they gaze further into the LA basin and head toward downtown, the scene becomes clearer as one of complete chaos.  Tommy turns  on the police scanner which had been turned off while filming, and it is erupting with chaotic calls for assistance.  Tommy pushes the helicopter to maximum speed while reporter Sean Thompson reaches to turn on his outboard cameras, and then relays an urgent message to the LANX News producer:  "This is SkyCopter 1 -- quick, you need to air this live video right now!"
In the studio LANX News producer Jack Ford takes one look at the footage coming in from SkyCopter 1 and shouts into the earpiece of on-air news anchor Jill Steiner, who is doing a live interview with a local politician.  "Jill, cut off the interview -- urgent breaking news.  Cover the SkyCopter footage I am putting up now.  Do it right now."  Jill stops talking in mid-sentence as footage appears on the screen behind her.  She gasps as she struggles to orient to what it shows.  The live helicopter video pans across the Los Angeles basin showing traffic snarled, many overturned cars, freeways clogged, black smoke rising from multiple areas, police cars and ambulances everywhere.  There is mass chaos and city highways are at a virtual stand– still. The producer tells Jill to let the SkyCopter News reporter cover the story.  She shakes her head in disbelief and then her veteran anchor skills kick in. She instinctively goes into her breaking news routine.
LANX anchor Jill Steiner: "We have breaking news, and are going straight to our SkyCopter Reporter over the I-5 freeway north of downtown....Sean, the video is frightening...what is going on?"
SkyCopter Reporter Sean Thompson's voice comes on-air as he struggles to decide what to cover first: "Jill, we have an enormous mess down there. The freeways are absolutely shut down. Accidents are everywhere, and many vehicles are burning. Hundreds of accidents, maybe over a thousand, we just don't know. Multiple ambulances are moving as best they can, and if they can, but it won't be enough. The police and EMS crews report they are overwhelmed and a number of their own vehicles have crashed. I see at least one gasoline tanker on fire on I-5 just north of downtown. There are reports of two Metro Rail train accidents. Police are reporting that many of the accidents were caused when vehicles just seemed to crash without any reason, and all over the city. And another odd thing, initial reports state there are very few survivors of all the freeway crashes."
Jill to SkyCopter 1: "What happened, Sean?  That many vehicles don't just...um...crash, for...for no good reason..." Jill stumbles as she tries to find the right words while still watching the live video feed.  "What else do you see?  And what do you mean, very few survivors?"
SkyCopter News Reporter: "Jill, it's just a mess, and I can't tell what is actually going on down there." Sean struggles to catch his breath...and also think of something useful to say. "Let me just say that we need eyes on the ground to tell both of us. We will try to get lower for a better view, but air traffic control is overwhelmed, and there is thick black smoke coming from the airport area. We are heading that way next to check it out."
"Give me just a moment" Jill says into the camera as she listens to her producer through her earpiece..."We are getting reports that this is happening all over the U.S. Something very strange is going on here and elsewhere....so now we will...hold on a moment..." Jill says as she presses on her earpiece "...and now my producer is telling me this may even be a worldwide event. What the hell is going on? OK, we are cutting over to our Washington D.C. news affiliate DCNX as they report on this breaking news..."
DCNX News feed starts while their reporter is in mid-sentence: "...and so it seems there are mass casualty events occurring all over the U.S. But they are spread out, not localized as in a terrorist attack. Additionally, reports out of several European countries show it is a global event, but exactly what has happened, no one seems to know. The main issues reported so far have been mass vehicle accidents, including numerous car and commercial truck accidents, several airplane crashes, freight train derailments, and a Washington Metro train accident in the underground near downtown. Emergency services and first responders are overwhelmed and cannot handle the multiple incidents. It is mass chaos out there. In related news, several well-known people seem to be missing. Requests for a statement from the White House have so far gone unanswered. There seems to be an unusual amount of confusion over there and staffers refuse to say anything. Whatever this is, whether some new form of diffused terrorism or mass technological glitches or whatever else, I can only say that the scale of this disastrous event has never before been seen.  Back to you in the studio.	"
As the DCNX report ends, LANX anchor Jill Steiner comes back on-air: "As we have just seen, this is not a local LA event. And whatever it is, it is very big and highly unusual. We going to a break to try to sort this out as best we can, and will be right back "
The Producer keeps the SkyCopter News live feed going, with the SkyCopter News crew now over south LA as Jill goes off air. Jill and her news staff discuss the events and the limited information available. A couple of her staff members who were seen just before the breaking news are now missing from the studio. Jill looks at their boss and tells him "Either find them or fire them. This is no time to be running off without permission!"
News Producer Jack Ford relays to Jill that police radio scanner reports indicate the cars that crashed had no drivers. Jill tells her news staff "get an automated driver-less car expert on the line and tell us if there has been some type of systemic software malfunction. And get a terrorism expert in here ASAP for me to interview. Also check for experts on any other types of technological glitches that might explain some of this. Just get me some people to interview. Now!!!"
Several news staff members report cell phone coverage problems as Jill is forced to go back on air without much information. She wings it and stalls for time. All she can do is cover what she sees on the SkyCopter News video, which shows a scene of freeways at a standstill, multiple smoking accident scenes, emergency vehicles which cannot move through the stalled traffic jams, and thick black smoke coming from the airport which has been confirmed as an inbound airplane crash just short of the runway on the beach along the ocean.
As Jill talks on-air about the live video feed from SkyCopter News she gets new inputs from her Producer, then tells the audience: "We now have reports that many of the cars were NOT the driver-less models.  Also, many of the cars which crashed did not have a driver at the crash site.  What does that even mean?  Going now to our on-scene reporter Don who is near downtown and stuck on the I-10 freeway.  Don – what can you tell us?"
Don:  "Jill, I am not able to move my car out here since the I-10 is a parking lot.  But I ventured out on foot and have seen several crash scenes where there was no one in the car at all, and no one near them.  Driver-less or driver-controlled is not the issue here.  Many of these cars simply had no one in them at all when they crashed."
Jill: "I'm not sure I understand what you mean the cars had no one in them. You mean the people were thrown clear?"
Don: "No, no, no...Jill, there was no one anywhere near the accident scenes. Not in them, not around them, not thrown from them. There were no drivers found. Just clothing in the driver's seat, and shoes on the floor. Beyond that I have no explanation.  Some had passengers who survived but they report their driver just vanished...they were there in the car one moment, and then gone the next. Drivers disappeared, and then the cars crashed, or at least that is what I have heard from multiple crash sites I have personally seen. Very odd, but I am just reporting what I have heard and seen out here."
At LA Police HQ the Chief and his leadership staff are watching LANX news coverage while trying to figure out what is happening with their officers out on the streets. LA Police Chief Washburn is watching the news while also monitoring incoming reports from his officers. He asks his Watch Captain: "What have we got here? No drivers in the crashed cars? Are you kidding me?" As the Captain shrugs, Desk Sergeant Thornton breaks in: "Sir, it's just as reported. My officers on-scene are reporting no people in or around many of the crashed cars. Or if there are crash survivors, they were passengers, and were not driving at the time of the crash. So sometimes there was a passenger or two who survived, but no drivers were found.
Something very strange has happened here, Chief. One of our guys mentioned Revelation."
Chief Washburn: "Revelation? Revelation of what?"
Sgt Thornton: "Not of what. The Bible. The Book of Revelation. Sergeant Fowler used to talk about this at lunch. He said some day people would just disappear. Believers “gone to be with the Lord” he would say. He was supposed to be here at work today but he never showed up.
He's a very religious guy, and he is also never late to work."
Chief Washburn: "I don't care what he said, I need facts."
Sgt Thornton: "Well sir, then you tell me. All the officers who I know are Christians are missing. Some were out on patrol when their cruisers crashed, others did not show up for their shift, and some were at their stations and vanished. Reports say there were uniforms in seats of the wrecked police cars. That's what I know."
Chief Washburn: "I'm going out there to see for myself." He exits for his police helicopter which is already running and waiting for him. As they lift off Chief Washburn wonders to himself if his family is safe. How many families are asking that question right now? But he returns his focus to the task at hand. An impossible one, for certain.
Back at the LANX studio, on-air anchor Jill Steiner has been reporting for over an hour now. “We now have reports of multiple airplane crashes around the country coming into the studio, including the one here near LAX"...She pauses to listen to her earpiece	"My Producer says we have someone who will try to explain what is going on. Actually, not live, but an online video. Really? Well, if that's all we have, then OK. We don't have much else, so roll that video now.”
The online video starts playing:
"Sometime in the future people will be searching for answers, trying to figure out why millions of people suddenly vanished. People were there one moment and then just disappeared, while many others did not show up where they were expected to be.
Vehicles crashed and no driver was found, and these were not self-driving. Airplanes crashed and the pilot's body was not at the crash site. People just disappeared, mainly in areas where Christianity has been more widely accepted. Many will be asking: "Where did all those people go?" "Why did people just vanish?" "What happened to their bodies?"
I am the author of the book "The Future Times" and other books about the Bible. My books are free, just as salvation is a free gift from God to those who believe in Jesus Christ as Savior.  I am not selling anything -- I am merely providing information from the Bible, where the answers you seek were written over 2000 years ago.
This catastrophic event is called by various names, one is the "Rapture" which means carried away, but "Rapture" is not a Biblical word.  More precisely it is called the Resurrection of the Church, with the Church being all believers in Jesus Christ during the current Age of Biblical time. The Bible says believers are not given their eternal bodies immediately after death, but must wait with patience for a resurrection event to occur in the future.  For the Church Age all believers in Jesus Christ who are alive when the Resurrection occurs will be given an eternal resurrection body, which is why the bodies disappear on earth as the mortal takes on immortality.  At the same time Church Age believers who had died prior to the Resurrection are brought back from Heaven into the atmosphere and also given their eternal bodies.  These are immortal bodies far more powerful than the bodies of angels.  The Bible reveals this in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 which says:
"The Lord Himself will descend from Heaven with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. We who are alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will be with the Lord forever."
And 1 Corinthians 15:50 says:
"...flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed— in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.”
It is likely only believers will hear that "shout and trumpet" since it is intended to call them home, but possibly it could be heard more widely on the earth.
But why did this happen now? What does this mean? And what comes next? The short answer is: intense judgment is coming, and time is very short.
Let me provide the timeline:
1) This resurrection event ends the Church Age and begins a period called the Great Tribulation (a term from Revelation 7:14), namely a 7 year period of great judgments on the earth which will intensify during that time. It also starts a 7 year clock ticking toward the 2nd Advent of Christ and Armageddon.  The Tribulation is divided into two parts, each 3 1/2 years long.  The first part will be bad, but not nearly as bad as the last 3 1/2 years, which will be the worst period in all human history.
While that online video is rolling, the news crew talk among themselves: Jill: “We need someone to interview live."
Producer: "We can't seem to get any church leaders on the phone right now to talk with us. So we need to just keep this You Tube video rolling to give us time to sort things out."
The video continues rolling....
"The resurrection event leaves only unbelievers on the earth. For those of you who are unbelievers when the Rapture occurs, meaning you have never believed in Jesus Christ as your Savior, you have no more than 7 years remaining to live unless you become a believer in Jesus Christ. At the end of the Tribulation all unbelievers will die.  Every last one. But most will die before that time due to the magnitude of the coming judgments. But those who become believers in Christ after the Rapture and survive the Tribulation will go into the Millennium, a 1000 year period of perfect environment on this same earth, which will be healed by God after the devastation of the Tribulation. Those surviving believers will live for another 1000 years in a paradise on earth, so if you believe in Jesus Christ as Savior immediately after the Rapture, you might live another 1007 years since there will be almost no death during the Millennium.
But what will happen during the 7 years of the Tribulation?  During the first 3 1/2 years there will be increased warfare and economic disaster.  Some nations will take advantage of the Rapture to attack other nations due to the chaos.  Soon after, the Western nations will consolidate power under a new leader called in the Bible the Antichrist, an evil dictator disguised as a god-like savior of the world.  He will deceive the world and ascend as ruler over the western nations, first taking over three of them, then another seven will capitulate to him forming a multi-nation Western alliance.  He will display false miracles, and also appear to die, only to live again -- a phony "resurrection."  This Antichrist will even be treated as a god, and a statue of him will be put into the new temple in Jerusalem after the first 3 1/2 years have passed.
During the last 3 1/2 years the judgments on the earth will become nearly unbearable. People will die by the billions.  Yes, billions.  By the end of the Tribulation probably 90% of the population of the earth will be dead from the judgments and warfare.  These judgments during the final 3 1/2 years will be brutal.  There will be massive earthquakes, huge tsunamis, explosive volcanoes, fireballs from the sky, destruction of the worldwide food chain and water supply, widespread famine and disease, nuclear war, and other disasters, with judgment upon judgment, and the earth will become a stinking mess with very little food or drinking water.  These are not metaphors.  This will all be very real.  Misery and death will be the norm.  Israel will be attacked several times.  Then after seven years the armies of the world will meet at Armageddon where they will be destroyed by the return of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself at His Second Advent as He prepares to take over rulership of the earth, and then He will institute the Millennium.
Those who become new believers will be persecuted during the Tribulation as never before. Many will become martyrs, and this will become the primary reason for the judgments on the earth. Jews will generally lose their blinders about Jesus Christ and will accept Him as their Messiah-Savior in much greater numbers. There will immediately be 144,000 Jews who will see the Rapture for what it is, and will believe in Jesus Christ and then begin to evangelize the world.  Believers must resist the Antichrist and his Mark of the Beast system of economic and social control if they want to survive.  The faith of believers will be tested to the breaking point.  It must be this way.  The lost and dying world can only be evangelized by their suffering, but their reward will be great in Heaven.  Families will be ripped apart by the evil of the world.
But believers must study and follow the Word of God.
There will be some confusion about the Rapture, as many high level clergy in some established denominations will be left behind. These were not true believers, even if they were high-ranking leaders of their church denominations. A believer relies on faith in Jesus Christ to provide salvation through the work of Christ on the cross rather than their own work, while those who try to work their way into heaven actually reject the salvation work of Jesus Christ the only Savior. These so-called pious workers will be left behind since they did not accept salvation as a free gift but rather sought to work for salvation. And others who were considered very sinful people will be taken up to heaven, since they believed in Christ at a young age, but then departed from their faith later. Salvation is a one-time event, and it is permanent.
We do not know what will happen to children who are too young to have made a salvation decision. Will the children of believers who are taken to heaven also be taken? We do not know the answer, so that could go either way.
This has been a brief overview. For more detailed information you can read my book "The Future Times". This is not a commercial...I never sold any of my books, and I certainly do not need anything from you now. But people on the earth need truth from the Bible so that you may believe in Jesus Christ and have eternal salvation, which is available to you right now. The Bible says:
"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved"
"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast" and "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
However bad you think the Tribulation might be, it will be much worse. It would be wise to heed the Bible and accept Jesus Christ as Savior. Don't delay. 90% of the people on earth at the time of the Rapture will die in fewer than 7 years. Time is very short, severe judgment is at your doorstep, and then Eternity is forever. Choose wisely."
Camera crew motioning to Jill who is talking to her Producer: "Back live in 3, 2, 1. 	"
Jill: "That was an online video by a book writer talking about what he called "the Rapture of the Church" also known as the "Resurrection of the Church," and how -- as he says -- it would result in worldwide events like those we have been reporting. As the video said, the events are concentrated in the mostly Christian regions of the world, while other areas were mostly unaffected, or not affected at all. Take that for what it is worth. But still very puzzling. We have heard some reporters calling this a "Vanishment." Whatever you call this, we are obviously overwhelmed here as more and more reports are coming in to us of strange events and chaos in multiple locations around the world. Rapture? Resurrection? Vanishment?
We'll be back in just a minute	so stay tuned.”
CHAPTER 2
THE FALLOUT

In Israel, near the new temple recently built on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, a group of young Jewish men are talking among themselves as 24 year old Shem Kolb leads the discussion: “My Christian friend had often told me about this day.  It happened just as he said. He told me it would be the event which would cause many Jews to believe in Jesus Christ as their Messiah.  He gave me this Bible and asked me to read a passage from 1 Thessalonians:
"For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 17  After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. "
Shem Kolb continues: "My Christian friend had also said the Church Age believers would just vanish and be gone, their bodies missing, and people would wonder what happened. He said this would motivate evangelization especially among Jews as their blindness toward Christ as the Messiah would be lifted by the Rapture. I cannot get my Christian friend to answer my texts or posts where he always hangs out, so I assume he has gone to be with his Lord, as he had always said he would. It all seems very real to me right now."
A young man from the group asks Shem: "But what does that mean for us? What are we supposed to do?"
Shem: "My Christian friend also said 144,000 Jews would immediately believe in Jesus Christ then become evangelists who are set apart to evangelize the entire world.  It is very sobering to remember his words.  The Book of Revelation discusses these 144,000 Jewish evangelists in detail.  Here, let me read from Revelation:
"Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea: “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.” Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel."
"My friend said this means before the Tribulation gets really bad, and he told me it surely will, God calls out 144,000 Jews to be evangelists.  That will be necessary since all believers will be gone after the Rapture happens.  Therefore a new group of evangelists must come forward very quickly and fill the need.  That is what he told me.  What do all you think?"
Shem's Jewish friends agreed that all this seemed to be true. They agreed to meet back at the Temple Mount the next day to discuss what to do next.
Back in LA, LANX News anchor Jill Stein continues to provide fast-breaking updates on freeways which remain shut down, airplane crashes, widespread looting being reported, police unable to deal with all the calls, 911 is clogged, cell phone coverage is limited, people on social media looking for loved ones, etc.  After continually saying "More breaking news" she stops and asks herself "Why am I even saying the words "breaking news" anymore?"  She stops as her Producer is talking through her earpiece, and the look on her face is one of disbelief: "We are just now receiving a report...is that confirmed...that the President is missing?  He was last seen in the Oval Office reading through briefing papers and now he cannot be located.  Also just in to us...can this even be true?  We are being told that the Vice President cannot be located, either.  He was in his residence getting ready to travel abroad and now the security staff cannot locate him either.  So what does this mean for our national leadership situation?" Jill listening to earpiece 	"We are joining our LANX affiliate in Washington as an expert there tries to shed some light on this issue	"
LANX joins Wash., DC station affiliate DCNX as a Constitutional lawyer is speaking on air:
(TV feed cuts into the middle of expert talking)	"so as I was saying, if the President is deemed to be unable to fulfill the requirements of his office, in this case he is missing and cannot be located, the Vice President would normally take over. If the Vice President cannot be located to fulfill the functions as President, and so far he has not been, then the Speaker of the House would take over as Acting President. Someone must always be in the position as leader of the country and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. So as I understand it, the Speaker of the House is now on his way to the White House to be sworn in as Acting President. That is all we know right now. I'm sorry, but that is all I have to say, and I need to run to a meeting on this issue now..."
Reporters shout questions as the expert leaves in haste, and the local news station reporter comes back on air. TV feed cuts off and LANX on-air anchor Jill Steiner continues to try to make sense of what is happening for her viewers.
Jill: "Scary times. Is this the beginning of the End Times or is this all just random? Was the book writer correct about the Rapture or Resurrection or "Vanishment" as some others are calling it? Is a time of Great Tribulation just beginning? It is just too much to fathom all at one time." Co-anchor Sarah Boswell has now joined Jill at the anchor desk to help with all the fast-breaking status. Jill turns to Co-anchor Sarah: "But how could both the President and Vice President be randomly missing? As most viewers know, both have made their Christian faith a matter of public record, and their campaigns have emphasized it as an important part of what they believe and who they are as people."
Sarah agrees and listens to new inputs through her earpiece from the producer, then says "Breaking..." but catches herself and then simply continues "We have just received word that Speaker of the House Antivon is about to arrive at the White House, so we now re-join our Washington DC news affiliate for a report..."
Video begins of Speaker of the House Dan Antivon arriving by limousine at the White House. Reporters rush the car as the door opens. A crowd of news reporters are yelling questions with their microphones thrust forward in his face:
Speaker Antivon: "No questions please -- please, not right now. I need to be briefed on the situation and then I will address the nation."  He hurries inside amid a swarm of Secret Service agents and staff members as reporters are left behind. The DCNX news anchor comes on and reports "Speaker Antivon's Chief of Staff has informed us there will be a press briefing shortly after the White House meeting concludes. With both the President and Vice President missing, we can only conclude that Speaker Antivon will emerge from the meeting in charge of the country, at least for now. That is about all we can tell you at this point."
Inside the White House door the missing President's Chief of Staff John Breen is waiting and escorts Speaker Antivon into the Oval Office where the Supreme Court Chief Justice, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and several Senators and House Members are already assembled.
Chief of Staff Breen: "Mr. Speaker, we believe the President and Vice President are not going to be located. Those assembled here have discussed the issue and see no other option except to swear you in as Acting President. Chief Justice Robins concurs that this is the proper approach given the extremity of the circumstances going on in the world. Chief Justice Robins will now discuss the Constitutional issues with you.
Chief Justice Robins: "Since only the Vice President can automatically become President under an emergency succession situation, you would be sworn in today as "Acting President" until the Congress votes and finalizes the succession issue. Of course, the Speaker of the House is stated to be third in line under the Presidential Succession Act, so we are proceeding as it directs. If neither the President nor Vice President are located within a very short time, then Congress would need to vote on final succession and the Acting part will be dropped.
With that, Mr. Speaker, I will now administer the oath of office as the Acting President of the United States to you.  "Please raise your right hand.  Do you solemnly swear.	"
After the swearing-in is complete, Acting President Antivon exits the White House for the Rose Garden where swarms of reporters are gathered to interview President Antivon. He strides out to meet the assembled reporters and states only that he has just been sworn in as Acting President, and will soon give a speech to the nation. He then goes back into the White House without taking any questions. On-air reporters from the various news networks begin to try to explain to their audiences what is going on, but without much information. They relay that Speaker Antivon, now Acting President of the United States, will address the nation, likely later in the day.
Back inside the White House President Antivon meets with the former President's Chief of Staff John Breen, who begins the conversation: "Mr. President, I know that you were opposed to most of the former President's policies, but I will help you however I can during this transition. I and my staff are at your service."
President Antivon: "Assemble all current White House staff members immediately to start the transition process." Breen: "Will do, Mr. President.  I will round up the staff.  They are waiting for orders."
As John Breen leaves, President Antivon thinks to himself how he relishes being called "Mr. President" by the former President's Chief of Staff. Power is what he has always wanted, and it has driven every decision in his life. He is anxious to use that power to its fullest extent.
After several minutes, the staff is assembled in the West Wing. President Antivon enters the room and speaks to current White House staff members: "Your services are no longer required. You are dismissed. My Congressional House staff is now my White House staff." White House staffers look at each other in bewilderment and then shuffle out in disbelief as President Antivon takes all his House Speaker staff members aside and installs them as the new White House Staff. He then addresses his new Presidential staff: "This has been a fortuitous set of circumstances, and now I have the power to change the world. The Vanishment has cleansed the nation of many unwanted people who have prevented progress for a long time. It appears they were Christians -- good riddance. Their religion had no tolerance for someone like me. They held to their singular beliefs in only one God, and only one way to reach their God. They held to their Bible and guns and moralism, and stood in the way of the progressive agenda. Now they are gone, so we can move forward in a highly accelerated manner. And I do mean highly accelerated. We must not waste this crisis opportunity by slow action or timid policies. The harmonics of the universe have converged to give us this moment in time, and we must take advantage of what this creative force is offering to us. I see it as a sign that we are the ones the universe has been waiting for. We are the ones destined to heal the wounds it has suffered under capitalistic greed and excesses, and the moralism of Christianity. The universe screams out to us to save it.  We are the ones it has sent to answer that call.  Now, we will take every advantage, seek every opportunity, ignore any rule or law, and take extreme and bold actions to heal the universe which has suffered from so much harm done to it by humanity under millennia of Christian rule. From this moment on, there are no rules for us to follow except that we will push progressiveness to the maximum and we will not tolerate anyone who stands in the way. Now that the Christians are out of our way, we will make sure they stay out of the way. Permanently! I will be implementing every form of emergency declaration possible while there is chaos. The timing is perfect. We must seize this great opportunity and use it to our advantage. I was born for this day!" The staff breaks out in cheers of approval as President Antivon departs to the White House private quarters to work on his speech to the nation.
As President Antivon enters the private quarters, the belongings of the former President are everywhere. He yells down the hall: "Maid, or someone, anyone?" "Yes, sir?" a running staff member says. "Get this junk out of here! All of it! Now!" As staffers comply, President Antivon sits down and starts typing his speech.
A few hours later at LANX news:
Jill breaks in as the new Acting President is about to address the nation. "We will now join the news feed from the White House to hear from Acting President Antivon:"
Acting President Antivon addresses the nation from the Oval Office: "My fellow Americans. I come to you in a time of great turmoil. I have just been sworn in as your Acting President.
Despite the Vanishment our nation is secure and your government carries on without interruption....(he continues for five minutes). At this time I am declaring both Martial Law and a National State of Emergency which will allow me to have much greater powers to deal with this situation. All I can do is assure you that your government will continue to function and I promise you that we will get through this, whatever it is, together."
A Washington, DC reporter provides a report from the White House:
"We have just witnessed the swearing-in of a new Acting President under the most unusual circumstances possible. The President and Vice President were apparently part of the "Vanishment" as some are now calling it. What or why it happened is not yet clear. But the relatively obscure Speaker of the House who had only recently come to that position, and whose past is clouded in mystery, is now our Acting President. But where did he come from? What is his background? What are the underpinnings of his belief system? These are all questions which deserve answers. As for now, we just hope he is the right man for the job. Back to you in the studio."
Jill comes back on-air at LANX, and she has brought in an expert to fill in some details for the audience:
"Those are good questions posed by the DCNX news reporter. We have in our studio a political consultant who has worked with the new Acting President. Mr. Holland, you have worked with him, so what can you tell our viewers about his background, and what we might expect him to do? I mean, most people have barely heard of him. And now he is the Acting President at a most unusual time of crisis."
Joe Holland: "Well, Jill, he is an enigma. I have dealt with him on several occasions yet I still do not know what to think about him. He rose to power very quickly and out of nowhere, going from State office to Speaker of the House after a series of highly unusual circumstances, including a couple mysterious deaths which eventually were ruled suicides. He seems to have been launched out of a cannon into his current position, and it is especially significant that he is from the opposing party to the former President and VP, which changes the political landscape dramatically. He is a hard-core and committed progressive-leftist, and I mean extreme left, which makes him a political disrupter. He is an environmental activist, even to the point of worshiping nature, although he is otherwise an atheist. He brings a deep distrust of religion into the position, especially Christianity, something which brought him into conflict with both the previous President and VP. Acting President Antivon is extremely ambitious and even brash, so I would expect him to take full advantage of the crisis caused by the Vanishment. His eloquence can be riveting, which enables him to convince the masses to follow him. That is something very surreal about him, that he can be so convincing to great crowds of people. There is something "other-worldly" about it, and..."
Jill: "I'm sorry to interrupt, but you just said 'other-worldly'. What do you mean?"
Joe Holland: "I am not even sure what I mean. I suppose there is simply something eerie, even supernatural, about how he can sway people. They find him mesmerizing in a Svengali sort of way. Otherwise I just cannot explain it."
Jill: "OK, please go on, Mr. Holland."
Joe Holland: "Anyway, since he has now been catapulted to the highest office in the land, it is unclear how he will use his power to further his ambitions, but it is certain that he will use every bit of power he can accumulate to himself. I personally view him as someone who wants to accomplish big things. I mean really, really big things. World changing things. He is not a patient man, and will act quickly and decisively to put in place policies to carry out his aggressive agenda. I worry about what he might do under Martial Law emergency conditions, which gives him immense power. And one more thing I must add about him, he gives me a very uneasy feeling, especially his stare, which is unnerving. There is something about him as a person which I do not understand, but it leaves me feeling unnerved. He is a very different type of individual. Almost like talking to more than one person -- I mean it is like there is something inside of him which defies worldly explanation. That is the only way to say it."
"OK, thanks for those insights Mr. Holland." Jill says as she turns toward the camera: "We will seek to provide a more in-depth profile on Acting President Antivon and attempt to answer some of these questions about him as soon as we have more information to report. After a break we will provide an update on what has happened so far today. A most unusual day, indeed."
After a very long day which began with many millions of people simply vanishing, LANX anchor Jill Stein turns over anchor duties to Sarah Boswell who continues with the news, trying desperately to keep up.
CHAPTER 3
THE FOUR HORSEMEN

That evening at her apartment, Jill Steiner has the news running in the background while she also reads a book she found on the internet called "The Future Times." It was the book mentioned in the online video which was aired on her news show earlier in the day. She reads to herself from the book:
"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, which are Dictatorship, War, Economic Disaster, and Death, will now begin to unfold.  These first four of seven Seals will reveal historical trends which will be pervasive throughout the entire seven year period of the Tribulation, which has just begun.  They reveal the trends which will occur in a very intense and sustained manner throughout the entirety of the Tribulation.  Later there will be specific Bowl and Trumpet judgments unsealed throughout the course of the Tribulation.  The Lord Himself, as Judge of the world, has broken open the 1st Seal."
Revelation 6:1 “I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, “Come!”
"Thunder in the distance warns of the coming storm. The gathering storm early during the Tribulation will be a set of extreme judgments on the earth, and the time for those judgments has arrived."
Revelation 6:2 “I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.”
"Seal #1 is the White Horse of dictatorship under the Antichrist who will strip mankind of their personal freedoms and force upon them a false satanic religion.  So-called “democratic” forms of government will be pushed aside and replaced by strong-armed dictators around the world.  The strongest of them will be the Antichrist, also called the Beast, or the Antichrist.  This man of Satan will appear very early during the Tribulation and deceive the masses into giving up personal liberties in exchange for a promise of collective security under his dictatorship.  The Antichrist will appear to be a leader on a white horse coming to the rescue, but instead he will be a force for great evil who enslaves millions of people.  Early during the Tribulation he will not be seen as a force for evil, and will use cunning speeches and selective warfare to gain his position, and then will assume dictatorship rule over a ten nation confederation.  Revelation 6:2 means “he conquers, so that he may conquer”.  This demon-possessed Antichrist conquers so Satan might gain power through him, and Satan will set him up as an idol to be worshiped by mankind.  So the white horse is dictatorship and loss of personal freedoms as a result of the Antichrist seizing power through conquest, which will continue and intensify throughout the entire Tribulation.  Once these first Seals are opened they reveal ongoing historical trend judgments, so once they begin, they continue throughout the entire Tribulation."
Jill puts down her book and thinks to herself about what happened today, as she tries to make sense of it all. So many horrible things occurred, and all at the same time. "What is the meaning of it, was this really the Rapture of the Church? Or some type of unexplained Vanishment as national leaders are now calling it? Can it really be the beginning of a period of Great Tribulation?" she asks of herself, with no answers.
As the day finally ends Jill is endlessly searching through internet news feeds and blogs.  A website has been set up to help those searching for loved ones who vanished, and she looks at the faces of those who were alive this morning, but now are gone.  The numbers are staggering, and estimated to be well over 100 million.  She falls asleep still wondering what it is all about...
In Jerusalem it is early morning, and the group of nearly a hundred young men have re- gathered on the Temple Mount to continue their discussion from the previous day. Shem Kolb, their de facto leader, asks for their attention as they draw near to listen to him. "Fellow Jews, we are at a crossroads. The issue has been made clear to us that we missed our Messiah Jesus Christ the first time around. We will not make that same mistake again. I ask you to join with me as new believers who will carry forth the message of the Messiah to our own nation Israel and also the entire world. The message of the Messiah must be proclaimed, and time is very short. All believers were removed from the earth by the Rapture, and now new believers must learn how to evangelize.  The Bible says the Messiah will return to earth seven years after the Rapture, and says there will be a core group of Jewish believers who must perform the task of evangelization.  We are the beginning of the 144,000 who will perform that task.  Are you ready?"  Cheers of agreement erupt among the group as these new Jewish believers eagerly await direction from Shem regarding their assignments.  As they prepare to depart, Shem asks them to quickly spread the message about what has really happened, and what it means.
Back at home on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Shem talks with his wife about what he has come to believe.
The morning alarm awakens Jill Steiner and her first thought is "Was it all a dream?"  She turns on the news.  No, it was real.  Day 2 is beginning.  She wonders to herself what today will bring as she hurries off to the studio.
Back at the anchor desk Jill begins her broadcast.  She had only recently been promoted to the position as news anchor of the LANX Morning Show.  It was quite a jump for someone only 27 years old.  Now she is reporting the biggest news in years, maybe decades.  It is only 24 hours after the Vanishment occurred.
Jill: "Good morning LA. We continue with news coverage of the Vanishment. There is a lot to cover but here is a very quick rundown on what we have learned so far:
1)  At approximately 10:20 AM yesterday the Vanishment occurred. People just disappeared. The numbers from around the world are estimated to be more than 100 million people.
2)  The US was hardest hit by the Vanishment, while it was virtually a non-event in the Middle East, Far East, and some portions of Africa. The numbers are highest in the south and southeastern United States.
3)  The cause is listed officially by government leaders as "an undefined Vanishment"
4)  The US President and VP vanished. The Speaker of the House was sworn in as Acting President.
5)  The people who vanished left behind their personal effects, namely clothing they were wearing, jewelry, glasses, phones, and so on at the point where they vanished.
6)  Nationwide, there were huge numbers of traffic accidents, a large number of airplane and train accidents, numerous industrial accidents, unattended critical infrastructure incidents resulting in power outages and countless other accidents, incidents and disruptions.
7)  Many people did not show up where they were expected. People on airplanes vanished and their clothing was left in the seat they had occupied. Numerous small stores were left unattended as owners or clerks did not return to close the shops. And other cases where people should have been in certain places but they were not, however their clothing was there in a pile.
8)  Some eyewitnesses saw people vanish and their clothing fall to the ground as they were talking to them. One person reported: "We were talking and suddenly there was only a pile of clothing where he was standing." Another eyewitness who was a passenger in a car which crashed said the driver was talking and in mid-sentence there was only a pile of clothing in the car seat, and then the car crashed."
9)  Most of those who vanished appeared to be Christians, however some clergy and high level church leaders remain. These are often from certain progressive denominations, but also some long established ones.
10)  The US Congress is in disarray as many Members are missing. There are not enough Senators to have a quorum for many types of voting. The balance of power in the Senate has also changed as the former President's party no longer has a majority of seats since it lost more Members to the Vanishment. This will likely allow Acting President Antivon to secure his power base more quickly.
There is much more, but that is a very quick rundown on what happened yesterday."
Jill continues: "So this is where we are just 24 hours into this phenomena, a Vanishment, or whatever it was.  We go now to where we began the reporting just 24 hours ago, to SkyCopter News reporter Sean Thompson who broke the story yesterday morning in the skies over the LA Basin.  Over to you, Sean:"
"Jill, that's right, just 24 hours ago our helicopter emerged over the San Gabriel mountain range to unveil a sea of chaos in the LA basin."  Sean reminds himself not to be overly dramatic.  "We witnessed clogged freeways.  We saw multiple burning locations, mostly traffic accidents, one airplane crash site, and some industrial accidents.  Now just 24 hours later, with the wrecker trucks having worked non-stop through the night, most freeways are at least minimally passable, although some bridges are closed for inspection.  Most people have stayed home at the request of the Mayor, and the new President has declared a state of emergency, both of which have helped ease the chaos. Essential services are getting back into operation, although slowly. Power outages remain a big problem. The city is returning to a minimally functional state, but only because most people have remained at home. From what we can see from the air, the city seems to have a surreal calm about it." Skip the drama, Sean reminds himself. "Reporting from Sky News, Sean Thompson reporting. Jill, back to you." Sean turns to pilot Tommy Jackson and says "I was a bit dramatic there." "Don't worry" Tommy replied, "for a newbie who was thrust into this yesterday on his first day, you have done just fine. It's not as though we were simply reporting on a fender-bender on the I-5 freeway and then went back to have donuts at the airport."
Jill: "We go now to our reporter Phil Stewart on the street in downtown LA for a walking view of the aftermath of the Vanishment. Phil, what do you see down there?"
"Jill, I have been out walking the streets of downtown LA, both yesterday and this morning. Yesterday I saw chaos as people were screaming that their loved ones, friends, co-workers, and other people had vanished. People were running and screaming in sheer terror and confusion. They had seen something normally reserved for a bad movie. Today it is much calmer, as the streets are mainly empty as people have generally remained home. A few homeless people have formed crude signs with the words "REPENT, THE END IS NEAR" on them. Nothing really new about that. But I have also seen several stores which were never locked up yesterday, and they remain open. A pile of clothes is generally found behind the counter, or elsewhere in those small stores. Very eerie.  Some of those stores have been looted, and looting is a real problem down here today. Police can't do much about it as they are overwhelmed. Just now I see several people running down the street with piles of stuff in their hands, yelling gleefully. I can tell you that I don't feel safe down here myself. The loss of order is just one of the disturbing issues we will need to consider as we move about the city.
Otherwise, given what we have been through during the past 24 hours, I can say that at least no additional people seem to have vanished today.  Jill."
Jill: "Thanks, Phil. We will continue to keep our viewers updated on events as they unfold. Back in just a minute..."
Over the next week, events continue to unfold on the world stage. Overall, the disruptions were confined to mostly Christian areas of the world, such as the US, Europe, and a few other regions. A couple small nations in central Africa were also hit hard. But the US was most severely affected, and was in a chaotic state. President Antivon was confirmed by Congress as President, which ended the "Acting" President issue. He appointed a political unknown as his VP who was previously the head of an environmental activist group. Martial Law continues in effect as President Antivon uses it as a means to implement aggressive political moves, and he signs numerous Executive orders putting controversial and far-reaching polices into effect without the consent of Congress. There is internal tension in the US due to the extreme measures being put in place by the new President. Dissent steadily grows as people see a loss of freedom setting in.
Jill Steiner is at home continuing to read "The Future Times." She does not yet know what to think about that issue. She never had any belief system outside of getting ahead as a reporter. It is what she had always wanted to do with her life. But she finds the book interesting, at least. She reads about what the Bible says will happen during the first half of the Tribulation:
"Now the Lord opens the 2nd Seal, the Fiery Red Horse of war.
Revelation 6:3 “When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!” 4 Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword.”
Seal #2 is the Fiery Red Horse and its rider.  This signifies four great armies which will engage in nearly constant worldwide war during the Tribulation, including the army of the Antichrist.  Despots seeking power will take peace from the earth, meaning a continuous world war affecting the entire earth.  The four spheres of power on the earth are the Kings of the North, South, East, and West, who will battle each other.  The resulting wars will include conventional, guerrilla, terrorism, and even nuclear war.
This is what was prophesied by Jesus just days before the cross: “You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end [Second Advent] is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.”  (Matthew 24: 6-7)
This horseman of war will be an historical trend, not a single event. There will be specific battles during later judgments, but the Fiery Red Horse means a world war will start almost immediately and wage during the remainder of the Tribulation. The Rapture will lead to great instability among the nations, and dictators will rush in to take advantage of the chaotic situation."
Jill did not realize it yet, but the world would soon see that the Four Horsemen had just arrived. Global war was at the doorstep. The first installment came quickly and unexpectedly.
CHAPTER 4
EZEKIEL'S PROPHECY FULFILLED

In Russia, the Kremlin leadership is meeting to finalize a war plan which would take advantage of the chaos in the West. The military leaders present their two-pronged offensive plan, whereby two Russian army groups will advance along separate tracks, and meet in the mountains of Jordan east of Israel. From there they will invade Israel with the ultimate objective being the capture of Jerusalem. The whole operation should take no more than one week. President Zhukov gives his final agreement to the bold plan. Time is of the essence.
The world is in chaos. The invasion is set to begin in 48 hours.
Two days later Russian military forces are detected by US satellites heading toward the Middle East. They are in two columns driving southward at great speed. President Antivon puts the US military on high alert.
While their forces are driving through southern Russia, the two Russian Army Group commanders review their plan for taking their objective, which is Jerusalem:
Gen. Ivanov: "My forces will drive through northern Syria, while you drive through Iran and southern Syria. This will confuse the West regarding our intentions. We will meet at Damascus, then push south together to Amman, Jordan, where we will cross into Israel toward Jerusalem."
Gen. Kokoff: "With the West in confusion, Israel should be an easy target for us. I'll see you at Damascus."
In Washington DC, President Antivon and staff discuss the massing of Russian forces in southern Russia. President Antivon: "What are they planning? They obviously think the crisis of the Vanishment will allow them to take advantage of the chaos in the world. But we need to wait and see what move they make before we do anything."
US Military Commander: "The Russians are planning something big.  They appear to be highly focused on the Middle East, and Israel in particular. Their forces are not massing along their southern border, they are moving fast and intend to keep going. We have intercepted a large number of communications discussing Israel. I would expect an invasion to their south any day now."
President Antivon: "We will take a wait and see approach. I cannot act now since their intentions are unclear." The Joint Chiefs suggest there should be movement of US naval vessels into the eastern Mediterranean. President Antivon agrees.
The following day two Russian Army Groups depart from southern Russia headed farther south by separate routes. Within two days they have merged their forces and are passing through Jordan east of Israel. They are moving rapidly without resistance. Just as they turn west and head through the mountains toward Israel the skies turn a ghostly gray, with swirling clouds tinged with red streaks. Suddenly, fiery hail begins to fall. Large burning boulders streak across the sky and fall directly on the Russian forces. The tanks and armored vehicles leading the military column through the mountains are crushed and burn as if they were plastic toys. Thousands of troops who were behind them but still in the plains are screaming in unison as they burn to death. The Russian forces are quickly wiped out. After only half an hour, a scene of burned-out wreckage of war machines and countless dead and burned bodies are everywhere. No one escaped alive. But most of the supplies were spared, including a large amount of food, dozens of fuel trucks, and an enormous amount of other materiel and supplies.
Israeli news media reports the incident as a stunning destruction of the invading Russian forces trying to invade Israel. It is reported as a freak weather event, although the fiery hail and boulders from the sky cannot be explained.
In Jerusalem the group of new Jewish believers led by Shem Kolb has expanded at an incredible rate.  What started as just a couple dozen new believers has now bloomed to 144,000 in just one week.  Shem, the leader of these 144,000 new Jewish believers, is meeting with the core group while the rest are listening online.  He reads from the book "The Future Times" to explain what has just happened:
"One of the very first wars during the Tribulation is described in Ezekiel Chapter 39 where the King of the North and his allies attack Israel. This is not the Armageddon campaign, which will occur seven years from now at the end of the Tribulation.
Ezekiel 39:2 “I will bring you [King of the North] from the far north and send you against the mountains of Israel. 3 Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand. 4 On the mountains of Israel you will fall, you and all your troops and the nations with you. I will give you as food to all kinds of carrion birds and to the wild animals. 5 You will fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD... I will make known my holy name among my people Israel.”
The King of the North sees an opportunity to attack Israel shortly after the Rapture has caused massive disruption on the earth, especially among those nations supporting Israel. During the Ezekiel 39 battle the King of the North will be soundly defeated in the mountains of Israel as God Himself rains down fire from Heaven on the enemy army, which then retreats in defeat."
Shem pauses from reading to explain the significance.  "You see how these events occurred exactly as the Prophet Ezekiel said it would be, and this was well over 2500 years ago.  And listen to the reason this has occurred.  This books explains that Israel will need the remnants of the war machines to survive the next seven years:"
"There are several reasons this war must occur very early during the Tribulation. First, Israel will burn the weapons of the defeated army for fuel for seven years, which puts the battle at the very beginning of the Tribulation. Ezekiel 39:9 “Then those who live in the towns of Israel will go out and use the weapons for fuel and burn them up—the small and large shields, the bows and arrows, the war clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them for fuel. The inhabitants of Israel are given this extra fuel because the Tribulation will be a time of economic disaster, so the Jews in Israel will need the fuel and supplies for survival during that seven year period.
The second reason this war occurs during the early part of the Tribulation is because it is one of two miraculous events which will be used by God to cause Jews to lose their blindness toward Jesus Christ as Savior, resulting in many Jews being saved early in the Tribulation.  The Rapture is the first event, as discussed by the Apostle Paul in Romans 11:25: “Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.”  Then shortly after the Rapture the Ezekiel 39 war occurs and God gives Israel a miraculous deliverance from the huge army of the King of the North who attacks during the time of chaos caused by the Rapture.  If not for this miraculous deliverance, Israel would be destroyed.  When discussing this war Ezekiel 39:22 says: “From that day forward the people of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God.” This shows how the divine deliverance from certain disaster changes the view of many Jews toward Jesus Christ, resulting in them becoming believers in large numbers.
Recall that a main purpose of the Tribulation is to bring many Jews to salvation so they will go into the Millennial Kingdom.  Then later in the same Chapter Ezekiel 39:27  says: “When I have brought them back from the nations and have gathered them from the countries of their enemies, I will be proved holy through them in the sight of many nations.”  Note the “When I have brought them back” describes the restoration of Israel as a future event which will occur seven years later at the end of the Tribulation, which further identifies the timing of this war.  Furthermore, the Ezekiel 39 war cannot occur before the Rapture since no prophetic event of the Old Testament can occur during the Church Age since the Church was not allowed to be revealed until Israel formally rejected Jesus Christ and His Kingdom (Millennium).  Jesus had to legitimately offer the Kingdom to Israel but could not have done so if there was any Church Age prophecy which must be fulfilled.  There is no prophecy to be fulfilled during the Church Age except for the Rapture itself, and this war is an Old Testament prophesy which has not yet occurred, and cannot occur until the Tribulation has begun.
The King of the North will pay a terrible price, suffering a devastating loss of people and equipment which will keep him out of the political and military picture until late in the Tribulation when he attacks the King of the West."
Shem adds after reading from the book: "It is all just as was written about in Ezekiel 39, and has been explained in this book written long ago. Let us go out to the mountains and see for ourselves."
At the same time a Rabbi from northern Israel who recently converted to Christianity is being interviewed on Israeli TV:
Reporter: "Rabbi Cohen, what is the significance of the defeat of the Russian forces in the mountains of Jordan?"
Rabbi Cohen: "We have seen the protection of our nation by God Himself alone, as Ezekiel 39 explains.  This is a day of great celebration of God's victory over our enemies.  Truly our Messiah will return in less than seven years from now, and then we will go into a Millennium where the Lord Himself will rule for 1000 years.  For now, the King of the North has been dealt a mortal blow.  But the forces of the Antichrist are coming for us in the near future.  We must prepare.  Time is short.”
CHAPTER 5
THE ANTICHRIST EMERGES

In Washington DC, President Antivon and advisers discuss what happened in Jordan as the Russian forces were destroyed. What happened to them? No one can explain it, but it is viewed as fortuitous. President Antivon praised the "Harmonic Convergence of the Universe" for the events. With the Russians suffering a great defeat, President Antivon sees it as a sign to him that he is the chosen one who has been given mystical powers and was sent to save the earth. His self-view of being a god is intensified by the events, which serves to embolden him to press forward with his grand plans for re-making the world order. President Antivon discusses his plans for uniting the various Western nations into a unified Western Alliance.
Plans include first negotiating with the EU, but if not successful, attacking three of the larger European nations, then the rest will fall into line. President Antivon is in a hurry to get this done. And the recent Russian defeat has accelerated his schedule. President Antivon: "This is our chance to remake the world. Let us not waste it." He gives orders to move quickly to put in place a plan to take over Western Europe. Rumblings of opposition within the military ranks is met with the removal of several high ranking Generals, and some are imprisoned.
Along with the military strategy, President Antivon takes swift action to nationalize all social media in the US, making it his mouthpiece and a means to control the citizens. He declares a climate change emergency and uses it as the basis for further restrictions of individual freedoms. He tells his Chief of Staff to plan and implement an economic control system, some sort of "mark" which will require compliance with his dictates in order to engage in any economic activity, to buy or sell. Gun confiscation is put in place. Martial Law will be further enhanced in his upcoming speech to the nation, along with more Executive Orders and a Declaration of National Emergency. With those in place, who needs a Congress or Supreme Court?
Negotiations with European leaders to unite the Western nations prove fruitless and seem doomed to fail as European leaders resist his initiatives. President Antivon decides to move forward with the military option to take over the Western nations by force. He gives orders to take over three countries, including Germany, France and Italy, and the rest will have no option but to capitulate. This plan is set to begin in one week.
President Antivon appears at the UN annual meeting and announces that all Western Nations must join him in a military/economic coalition which will be the strongest in the world.
Several European leaders push back on his aggressive approach. They call him "arrogant and foolish" which further inflames him. President Antivon declares that there will be a coalition one way or another. Several Western leaders walk out. Antivon is not impressed.
President Antivon meets with his senior military leaders and announces his plan:
"US forces in NATO will simultaneously take over the governments of Germany, France and Great Britain. The leaders of these three nations are to be taken captive and the government buildings taken over. The three nations will have no option but to yield and join as subordinate nations to a Western Alliance. Our plan is to get them to capitulate without invasion if possible, or by invasion if necessary, and then the others will join willingly. If the others do not join us, their countries will be invaded and taken over by force."
The plan shocks most in the room who hear it, but the example set by removing many of their fellow Generals made it clear there will be no dissension. The plan is put into motion. The power position of President Antivon will be firmly solidified by the formation of a Western Alliance under his command, and his plans for further world conquest can then be launched having the most powerful combined military force in the world. This is risky, but it is what Antivon does. He is in it to either win it all or lose it all.
Two weeks later the leaders of France, Germany and Great Britain are captured and held hostage by President Antivon's troops. The leaders protest but cannot overcome their dire situation. A US envoy from President Antivon contacts each one and tells them "We can do this together, or we can do this without you. Make your choice." Having no other option, the three leaders agree to join the Western Alliance under President Antivon's leadership.
The following day President Antivon addresses the nation: "For a very long time national leaders have talked about solving the world's problems. They just talked and talked but what was ever accomplished by it? Nothing. Climate change is ruining our planet. The enemies of the West are plotting against us. Internal enemies of the State engage in subterfuge, as new Christians emerge and apply their hatred for the progressive ideals we believe in. It is only a matter of time before the Middle East is engulfed in war. We can and must act now to solve these issues before they destroy us all. That is why I ordered our military forces stationed in Europe to seize the capitals of France, Germany and Great Britain. Our forces have already accomplished this first phase, and we are now negotiating the terms of our new world order with the European Union. The time has come. This is our chance to remake the world. We must not waste this opportunity."
The following day the remaining European nations capitulate and agree to submit to the leadership of President Antivon under a combined Western Alliance, which becomes the most powerful alliance in the world by far. News of the events catch the Russian and Chinese by surprise. They are shocked, but do not have the power to take on this huge new alliance. Both begin regional alliance negotiations with neighboring countries, even though some of those are their enemies.
China's leadership gathers in emergency session in Beijing to discuss the recently formed Western Alliance. Premier Zhou begins: "We have seen the aggression by the US which has greatly upset the balance of power in the world. We cannot stand by and watch as they take more and more power to themselves. They are already very powerful and will gain even more power, likely in areas where we have influence such as Africa. We must find new alliances for ourselves to offset the West. And with the recent disastrous defeat of the Russians and their Northern Alliance, they cannot provide any effective counter to the West. We must consolidate power here in the Eastern sphere to avoid being the next casualty of the West."
A similar emergency meeting is also in session among Middle East and North African countries, many of them long established enemies. The discussions were much the same as in the Eastern sphere. The power accumulation by the West has forced these countries to seek a Southern Alliance in an attempt to repel any attempts to take them over one by one. And the potential Southern Alliance members not only fear the West, but also the Northern and the Eastern Alliances. In these times of accumulation of power, no one could be trusted to leave the Middle East and North Africa alone, since the countries in those areas were viewed as a source of gaining power in the Mediterranean region close to several Western Alliance member countries. An agreement is quickly reached among Middle East and North African Muslim countries, and the Southern Alliance becomes a reality.
Around the world new believers are forming study groups to learn about their newly discovered faith. There are no Bible experts who remain on earth, so they must read online books and try to learn as fast as they can. But they find the task is not easy, since there are many books, but most books about the future were written by people who were not very accurate. So the task of finding useful information was difficult.
One group in Texas has been searching for answers and assembles almost daily for a group study.  They have found that most of the detailed information about the Antichrist comes from Daniel Chapter 7, and the multiple heads, horns, and crowns on this Antichrist discussed in Revelation relate back to Daniel's prophecies.
The group leader James Coldwell tells those who are gathered:
"We are picking up where we left off last time with the Book of Daniel which describes four different beasts which look like various animals including a lion, a bear, a leopard, and a ten horned beast. The various beasts represent the four great empires of the ancient world, namely Chaldea (Nebuchadnezzar), Persia (Cyrus the Great), Macedonia (Alexander the Great), and Rome (the Caesars). We pick up the passage in Daniel at the discussion of the fourth beast, the Roman Empire. Let me read from Daniel Chapter 7":
Daniel 7:7 “After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast— terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.”
Group Leader Coldwell continues: "Daniel prophesied about the coming of the Roman Empire 500 years before Julius Caesar. Daniel foresaw how Rome would become a great empire through conquests on a scale unequaled in human history. Daniel also foresaw that Rome would be made up of ten major nations/regions it would conquer, and these ten are part of what is now Western Europe, North Africa, Greece, and part of Asia Minor. So the fourth beast described by Daniel is ancient Rome during the Caesars. It conquered the world, devouring many nations and peoples. It had ten horns, meaning ten regions as defined in ancient times."
"Now Daniel's vision turns to the Tribulation, when an empire ruled by the Antichrist will come out of the nations which were part of the ancient Roman Empire. Now to the New Testament, we see there are numerous references to the Antichrist. Daniel describes how the Antichrist as ruler of this Revived Roman Empire will consolidate his power:
Daniel 7:8 “While I was thinking about the horns [ancient nations], there before me was another horn, a little one [Antichrist], which came up among them [nations during the Tribulation]; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully.”
Daniel 7:23 “He gave me this explanation...24 The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom [ancient Rome]. After them another [11th] king will arise [Antichrist], different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings [European nations]. 25 He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people [Jews] and try to change the set times [prophecies about the Tribulation] and the laws [totally lawless]. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time [3 ½ years].”
Group Leader Coldwell: "This is describing the Antichrist. Let me read from the book "The Future Times" which we all have been reading which interprets these Bible passages:"
"This “little horn” is the Antichrist who during the first 3 ½ years of the Tribulation will conquer (“uproot”) three of the ten large “horns” (nations) and the other seven “horns” (nations) will submit to his rule as the King of the West during the Tribulation.  He will come from an 11th  nation which was apparently related to but possibly not part of the ancient Roman Empire.  This confederation of nations under the Antichrist will  become the Revived Roman Empire of the second half of the Tribulation, which is consolidated from ten separate nations by warfare and treaty during the first half of the Tribulation.  This also relates back to the first Seal, the Rider on the White Horse (dictatorship), and the second Seal, the Fiery Red Horse (worldwide warfare).  So the Antichrist consolidates power by warfare during the first half of the Tribulation setting up his evil tyrannical rule over a ten nation confederation made up of former Roman Empire countries and uses his accumulated power as a tool of Satan during the last part of the Tribulation.  He will then attempt to conquer the rest of the world as his predecessors the Caesars had done.  He will do Satan's work as he tries to destroy Israel and all Jews everywhere during the last 3 ½ years of the Tribulation (the meaning of “time, times, and half a time” – 1 year plus 2 years plus ½ year = 3 ½ years).
The passages from Daniel describe the Antichrist and his origins several thousand years before he actually arrives.  Daniel says the Antichrist will rule western nations which were formerly part of the ancient Roman Empire, so his empire is not made up of Islamic nations or other regions.  Those regions will have their own power spheres and will also be pulled together by Satan into his evil plans.  More will be discussed about the origins of the Antichrist in Revelation Chapter 17."
A member of the study group asks: "How many here believe that President Antivon is the Antichrist?" Everyone talks at once, with most saying they believe he is, some saying they are not sure, and a few saying they do not believe he could come out of the US. But all agree that Antivon is anti-Christian. "He does not believe in God, but believes he is a god!" one member interjects. Another asks "How can we really know?"
Group Leader Coldwell tries to answer the questions: "The Antichrist has some of the traits of the various nations and rulers of the ancient world – a mixture of speed, strength and cunning -- but he will be different. Satan will empower him directly, making him one of the most powerful dictators in history. The Antichrist is discussed in a number of Bible passages and is referred to by several names. Although the term “antichrist” has stuck as the name commonly used for him, the Bible calls him “the Beast”, “the Beast out of the Sea”, “the antichrist”, “the man of sin”, “the little horn”, “the man of lawlessness”, “the man doomed to destruction”, and “the lawless one” as noted in the following representative passages:
2 Thessalonians 2:3 -- “Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. 4 He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God.”
2 Thessalonians 2:8 -- “And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.”
1  John 2:18 -- “Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist
is coming, even now many antichrists have come.” Revelation 13:2 “The beast I saw resembled a leopard”
Daniel 7:8 – “While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one...”
Then Group Leader Coldwell reads from "The Future Times":
"The rise of the Antichrist will be orchestrated by Satan with a dramatic flair which builds him up as a deity and therefore an object of worship in the eyes of the world. But his worshipers will actually be worshiping Satan.
Revelation 13:3 “One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast. 4 People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, “Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?”
The Bible predicts that the Antichrist will survive a “fatal wound” received during an assassination attempt since a “sword” is used against him (Revelation 13:14).  He will appear to actually die, but will be revived and live when everyone on earth thought he was dead.  This near-death experience will cement his “deity” image and help promote him as head of the new religious order sponsored by Satan.  People of all nations will see his Satan-induced power and will witness his “resurrection” from the dead, then will worship Satan through the Antichrist.  The two will be practically indistinguishable.  This worldwide adoration mixed with his presumed “miraculous resurrection” leads to the Antichrist setting up his own religion where he is the deity, and he places his own statue in the temple in Jerusalem to be worshiped as an idol (the Abomination of Desolation).  Satan is such a copy-cat, and this becomes one reason why this man is called the antichrist, because Satan uses him to mimic and mock the true salvation work and person of Jesus Christ, including Christ's miracles, death and resurrection.  As we noted earlier, when the Jewish believers in Israel see the Antichrist idol statue called the Abomination of Desolation put into the temple in Jerusalem they must flee to the high desert areas of Jordan where they will be protected, or they will be killed.
The Antichrist will be a genius, so we must give him his due. He will accomplish many things due to his combination of great intellect, communication skills, military genius, political skills, and even his use of false religion and idolatry to accomplish the will of his benefactor, Satan. Satan uses the man's innate skills, which will be numerous, and adds his own empowerment through demon possession and even Satan possession at times to make the Antichrist into a rock star level superhero world leader in the eyes of the degenerate unbelievers of the world.  World events will also lure people into a desire for a strongman to solve the world's problems resulting from the “Four Horsemen” judgments of Revelation 6. He even uses false miracles to wow the masses, which will be discussed later. So his rise to power is swift and decisive, and he becomes the world's most famous and popular man and the public will literally worship him as a deity. But his precipitous fall 3 ½ years later will mirror his meteoric rise.
The following passages in the Bible describe the Antichrist's significant capabilities:
1)  Political skill – pulls together many (Revelation 13:1; Daniel 7: 20-21); 2) Military skill (Revelation 13:1; Daniel 7: 20-21; Revelation 16), 3) Religious skill – sets up false religion which deceives the masses (Revelation 13:6-8, Revelation 17+18), 4) Power of miracles (2 Thessalonians 2:1-12), 5) eloquent communicator. Again, demon and Satan possession will enhance his innate skills to levels where people will see him as a god— but only for a short time.
The key to the success of the Antichrist is his ability to put in place a system of evil power which takes away individual freedom, especially freedom to worship anyone except himself, in exchange for the promise of security and economic benefit. The Tribulation will be a time of heightened insecurity for people due to the disruption of the Rapture, followed by extreme levels of disaster from the Four Horsemen and extreme natural disasters which we have already noted. Therefore, people will be ready to accept this dictator since he appears to have great power on several levels, and promises the masses he will keep them safe and secure. Of course, that will turn out to be a false promise of security, and they will lose their freedoms in exchange for nothing.
Revelation 13:5 “The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months.”
Satan gives the Antichrist supernatural communication ability to issue false promises in a manner which makes them widely accepted as truth. Add to that his arrogant and blasphemous tone, and the degenerate world will view him with awe and reverence, and will refuse to turn to the true Savior Jesus Christ. His short-lived power will last for 3 ½ years until the Second Advent of Christ. Revelation 13:6 “It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven.”
The Antichrist sets himself up as a deity and continually blasphemes God and all associated with God, in Heaven and on earth. His taunting of God will make him a hero to the degenerate masses, who will adore him.  He turns his statues into idols to be worshiped. He slanders God and the elect angels in Heaven because he cannot stand anyone having more power than he has, especially those beyond his reach to intimidate or harass. His absolute arrogance will further endear him to his adoring fans. They will think in their own arrogance that God must be powerless against him, since at first there does not appear to be any retribution against him. But God will only give him 3 ½ years, then it will all end. He will soon become the very first resident of the Lake of Fire, the eternal residence waiting for Satan, fallen angels, and unbelievers of all time. Revelation 13:7 “It was given power to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation.”
After reading from the book, Group Leader Coldwell continues:
"The Antichrist will make a treaty with Israel during the early part of the Tribulation, then will break that treaty and occupy Israel without much resistance and install a puppet ruler over Israel who supports him.  By the middle of the Tribulation the Antichrist will have a significant military presence in Israel, setting up a military target for the other three Kings to come after him at the end of the Tribulation resulting in the final battle at Armageddon.  In the meantime, the Antichrist will exert great power over Israel, including military power, and also power over economic life and even power over life and death, but these powers will not cause Jewish believers to renounce their faith in Christ. This will severely frustrate the Antichrist.  God permits persecution of believers in Israel to show His power through believers in the face of absolute evil. The Antichrist will have extreme power over many of the people of the world, and he will be one of the most powerful people of all time, humanly speaking. But he cannot control God's faithful believers, even though he will kill many of them for their refusal to comply with his system of evil. It should be noted that all believers in Israel will have fled to the mountains of Jordan before the Antichrist takes firm control of Israel, so the Jewish believers who will be in Israel during the second half of the Tribulation are recent converts. When we see their faith and martyrdom, we must remember what very new believers they are, and how impressive their display of faith will be under the circumstances."
Revelation 13:8 “All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.”
A member of the study group asks: "Why would people chose to follow the Antichrist?"
Group Leader Coldwell:
Unbelievers on earth believe in the Antichrist instead of believing in Jesus Christ. They will prefer Satan's lie to the Truth. Worshiping the Antichrist will be satanic worship, since it is Satan's power they are seeing. This “hardness of heart” will be extreme among the degenerate masses during the Tribulation. The Antichrist will also make life difficult for those who refuse to follow him. He will institute a "Mark of the Beast" program which will prohibit anyone from buying or selling anything, including food, without accepting this Mark. But as believers we are told we must refuse the Mark. It will be difficult to refuse as we look at our families and others who depend on us. But refuse we must. The Bible says we must be faithful and endure patiently:"
Revelation 13:9 “Whoever has ears, let them hear. 10 “If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity they will go.  If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword they will be killed.”  This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God’s people.”
"As noted, these will be new believers who become martyrs, none for more than a few years because the Rapture removed all believers before the Tribulation began. For Jewish believers in Israel it will be even more difficult. At mid-Tribulation all believers in Israel must flee to a safe hiding place in the mountains. After that flight, all new believers from that point on are required to remain and be prepared to fight when the time comes. Those who sacrifice for the Lord during this extreme time of evil will receive their reward in Heaven. God allows evil to have its way for short periods of time throughout history, but God never loses control. The Antichrist will kill many believers, either directly or indirectly by taking away their ability to buy basic necessities since they will refuse the Mark of the Beast. But the murderers are destined for much misery on earth during the Trumpet and Bowl Judgments followed by eternal condemnation."
After a prayer for guidance the study group members depart. They will be back again the next day seeking more wisdom from the Scriptures.
CHAPTER 6
THE FALSE PROPHET

In Israel, recently elected Prime Minister Hamon Garlock has been following news of the rise of President Antivon very closely. He views him as a fellow traveler on the road to a radical progressive future. Garlock is an atheist who rose to power in a bitter political struggle, and would not have won except that his opponent -- who was expected to win easily -- died in a freak accident just before the election.  Garlock is another of Satan's men who had recently and unexpectedly come to the forefront as a world leader under highly unusual circumstances. The Bible calls him the "Beast out of the Land" (Israel), and also the "False Prophet," because he will support the Antichrist and promote his idolatry to the Jews. Garlock decides to make a treaty with the Antichrist very early during the Tribulation which will allow the army of the Antichrist to station military forces inside Israel in return for certain advantages for Israel, and at the expense of the Arab nations. Prime Minister Garlock flies to the US to meet with President Antivon and finalize the proposed treaty. The two leaders meet at Camp David to discuss the remaining details. After two days of discussions, they reach an agreement.
Prime Minister Garlock: "This Treaty between the US and Israel is a necessity because of the recent attempted invasion by Russia. US troops will be stationed in Israel to prevent any future attacks. It is also important to us that the Treaty allows Israel to fully occupy the Temple Mount where the new Temple has been built, because the religious Jews demand it, and they also want to resume animal sacrifices. I need to gain their support since they were strongly opposed to my election as Prime Minister. So with these provisions already in the Treaty as we have agreed, I am very satisfied and ready to sign."
President Antivon: "Then we are in agreement. The Arab nations will not like it, but I will deal with them. Let us make a public announcement today that we have a Treaty."
Prime Minister Garlock: "I agree. And although the Treaty does not include the "religious" support you want from me, you can be assured that I am strongly committed to supporting your priorities as we have discussed privately. But the rest of my Cabinet does not need to know about that."
News of the Treaty between the Western Alliance and Israel spreads quickly, and most in Israel are generally positive since they view it as protection of Israel by the world's most powerful Alliance. But not all agree. One reporter seeks out Rabbi Cohen from northern Israel who recently converted to Christianity and is an outspoken critic of Prime Minister Garlock.
Reporter: "Rabbi Cohen, what is your take on the Treaty?"
Rabbi Cohen: "This is the Treaty between the Antichrist and the False Prophet discussed in the Bible.  Revelation 13:11 says “Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.”  The Beast out of the Land, not "earth," means the False Prophet is from Israel, often referred to in the Bible as “the Land."  “Beast” means they are both demon possessed and serve the “dragon” Satan.  This man is known to us as the False Prophet since his primary role is as the religious supporter of the Antichrist, promoting him as a deity.  So the False Prophet, even though he is an atheist, has a "religious" side to him, promoting a false satanic religion through mysticism and idolatry.  He is doing Satan's work, just like the Antichrist, which is why this verse says he “spoke like a dragon.” Horns in the Bible refer to power, and the False Prophet's “two horns” show he wields his own power as ruler of Israel and is also a powerful religious leader supporting the Antichrist.  The False Prophet will also be the one who puts the idol statue of the Antichrist into the Temple in Jerusalem at the midpoint of the Tribulation.  The Jewish leader is called the False Prophet since he will support the Antichrist in promoting his satanic false religion.  The Antichrist will use a treaty to make the False Prophet his puppet to aid in spreading his evil religious system throughout Israel.  The Antichrist will show his antisemitism later, but for now it suits his needs to work with this False Prophet and with Israel, especially to absorb the apostate remnants of religious Judaism into his own satanic religious system.  While this is happening, many Jews are turning to Jesus Christ recognizing Him as their Messiah Savior.
Reporter: "So you think Prime Minister Garlock is the False Prophet who supports the Antichrist who you say is President Antivon? Are you serious?"
Rabbi Cohen: "Yes, very serious.  The False Prophet is referred to in several ways throughout the Bible: 1) False Prophet (Matthew 24:24; Revelation 19:20); 2) Beast out of the land (Revelation 13:11-18); and 3) Dan the Serpent (Genesis 49:16-18)."
"And Revelation 13:12 says “It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been  healed. 13 And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people. 14 Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.”
"So this verse says there will be some sort of "false resurrection" of the Antichrist, although we do not yet know what that means. I would expect that we will soon find out.
"The False Prophet's alliance with the Antichrist is two-fold, both as puppet ruler in Israel and as a religious leader, and he will exercise full authority on behalf of the Antichrist. The False Prophet will perform pseudo miracles under the power of demons, including as it says here “causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth”. The two Beasts work together to do Satan's work in establishing and promoting the worldwide false religious system where the Antichrist is the deity and the False Prophet is his number one prophet and keeper of the false religion. Again we see how Satan tries to mimic God's truth by substituting falsehood to deceive the masses. The near-death and false resurrection of the Antichrist will be used by the False Prophet as a marketing tool to promote him to the masses as a deity, which is why the Abomination of Desolation idol – a statue of the Antichrist -- is set up in the temple in Jerusalem at the direction of the False Prophet. This idol statue of the Antichrist was described by Daniel:
Daniel 9:27 -- “He [Antichrist] will confirm a covenant with many [Israel] for one ‘seven’ [Tribulation 7 years]. In the middle of the ‘seven’ he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end [Second Advent] that is decreed is poured out on him.”
Rabbi Cohen concludes: "Therefore the False Prophet is a tool of the Antichrist to promote him as a god to the unbelievers of Israel. Many will be deceived because of the pseudo- miracles the Antichrist appears to perform, along with the message of healing the earth and eliminating the undesirables. And the False Prophet will be the one who sells these lies to the people of Israel."
The Reporter goes away shaking his head.
CHAPTER 7
ANTICHRIST AND FALSE RELIGION

At the White House the staff is scurrying as President Antivon decides to go out for dinner to his favorite restaurant. He has not been able to do so since becoming President. As he arrives at the restaurant and begins walking up the sidewalk he is targeted for assassination. A knife- wielding attacker bursts out of the crowd yelling "Die, Antichrist" and manages to stab President Antivon in the chest. The attacker is immediately killed by Secret Service agents.
President Antivon is rushed to George Washington University Hospital, and after attempts to revive him is declared dead. The sheet is pulled up over him as the Chief Medical Officer goes to the briefing room and begins to tell the nation that President Antivon has been killed. The Press outside is also notified, and the news spreads quickly. As the briefing continues an Aide comes into the room where the body is laying and sees movement. As he begins yelling, the doctors are urgently called back and President Antivon is found to be alive and is revived.
After several minutes of the world thinking President Antivon is dead, news that he is alive creates euphoric celebrations worldwide. Rumors spread of a "resurrection" from the dead, slowly at first, then a frenzy of press activity declares it is a "miracle" and "a sign of our impending salvation." President Antivon instantly gains a god-like stature among his loyal followers. News announcers declare "He is the One we have been waiting for to deliver us, and to deliver the earth. He is indeed a god among us."
Crowds in Times Square go from sobbing to cheering wildly at the news of the "resurrection" of President Antivon. Everyone heard what they wanted to hear. Climate change will finally be resolved by this god-like man who can even cheat death. The world believes it has a new savior who will end climate change, implement world peace and provide prosperity under a new world order, and stop the spread of what they view as "Christian moralism."
After a short recovery, President Antivon quickly acts to consolidate even more power. The military will now be used to enforce the new laws requiring compliance with his climate priorities. Christians must be controlled, stopped or eliminated entirely. The internal police must be expanded. Most citizens, but not all, cheer and celebrate the new stronger initiatives.
At the Capitol Building Senators talk among themselves about the drastic changes being made by President Antivon without consent of Congress:
Senator Anders:  "The changes being made are unconstitutional and frightening.  I am not on board with this shredding of our Constitution.  We lost 16 Senators to the Vanishment and they were ones who would have helped stop this madness.  But they are not here to help, and the replacement process is uncertain and has stalled.  What are we going to do?"
Senator Farrow: "Who would have thought that it was the Christians who have vanished who were holding the country together? They were the core of the good and decent people who believed in the principles our country was founded on. As long as they were here this sudden degradation of society could not have happened, but now that they are gone the majority of those who remain are ready to accept the radical leftist and anti-Constitutional policies of President Antivon. He is lawless, but what can be done? The citizens who would have stood in the way are gone."
Senator Davis: "President Antivon's measures have declared lawful people criminals, and criminals are now celebrated as heroes. After the former Christians vanished, the new Christians were declared to be enemies of the State. President Antivon is trampling the rights of all good and decent citizens, especially these new Christians."
Senator Ford: "There are rumblings that the new President is the one called the Antichrist. I now believe it myself. Something must be done or he will lead us straight to Armageddon."
Senator Davis: "No wonder he hates Christians so much. Although I had never believed it before, the Bible says there would be a man like this. He is mad, and is lawlessly implementing his madness. We must stop him from further shredding the Constitution or he will destroy our country. But the masses are swayed by his soaring rhetoric and lies. We need to meet tomorrow and discuss details, but we must be very discreet." They all agree to meet the following day at a secret location.
Later that day, the four Senators are arrested and charged with treason.
The next day President Antivon addresses the nation:
"Today I am furthering my previous Declaration of Martial Law and expanding on the National State of Emergency to focus on combating global climate change. If we do not fight global climate change, my advisers say the earth will not survive even seven more years. This is the real global war which is necessary. Those who do not believe and join will be shunned. This includes primarily the new Christians who are climate change deniers, and also do not believe in LGBTQI propositions, gender choice, or other progressive ideas. Those who do not renounce such hate must be dealt with harshly. I am implementing a system which will only allow those who join our fight to buy and sell in commerce. Anyone who is not with us is against us, and especially the Christians if they refuse to renounce their backward and hate- filled beliefs."
Watching President Antivon in his conference room in Silicon Valley the CEO of a social media giant says to his staff who have gathered to see what President Antivon would say: "This is the opportunity we have been hoping for. We will muster all of our power to support the President's initiatives. Make sure all employees know that our priority is to save the world, and to do it we will do whatever is necessary to support President Antivon's policies. The Martial Law and emergency order will help cut through all the red tape. We need to get on this fast, so let's get to work and change the world."
In the streets many celebrate President Antivon's initiatives. Each one hears what they want to hear from his speech. Many think they will personally benefit since Christians will be forced to "convert" to the new way of the State. A leader of the assembled crowd is heard saying: "The ones who vanished needed to go. They stood in the way of the progressive society and the healing of the earth. With them gone, we can now move ahead into a future filled with great promise, and without all the other things those Christians perpetrated on society." And the prospect of taxing wealth from the new Christians who are being declared outcasts and will soon be dispatched in large numbers also helps deepen their admiration for President Antivon. The average person sees him as the one they have been waiting for. To them he is a savior. He is a god.
But elsewhere there is opposition to the power seizure of President Antivon. New believers see him for what he is. He is the Antichrist discussed in the Bible. He is the one who will bring only satanic influence and destruction. Believers meeting in secret all over the country commit to opposing the Antichrist. They know the Mark of the Beast is coming. They know this man will lead them to Armageddon. They know they must oppose him and trust in God to deliver them. But they also know it will be a hard road to travel. Secret internet groups are set up to support the pockets of believers in the US and elsewhere. But they must be very careful. They realize the forces of the Antichrist will seek them out to shut them down and eventually will try to destroy them.
CHAPTER 8
THE JEWISH AWAKENING

Scene in Israel at a Synagogue in Jerusalem:
Rabbi Cohen of northern Israel is visiting Jerusalem to address worshipers: "My friends, we Jews were wrong. We missed our Messiah. He has come, and we missed it. He is Jesus, the One our Christian friends worship, and we missed His coming to us. [Many start to leave the Synagogue, but many others stay.] It is time to change our way of thinking and accept Jesus as our Savior. He was the One the Torah and Prophets spoke of. He was the One who will return for His believers in just seven short years. Inside the Temples in Israel the apostate Jews who still refuse to believe in their Messiah have re-instituted animal sacrifices. That is a blasphemy to the Lord! The Lord Jesus Christ was the only sacrifice, and ended the animal sacrifices. Our rituals and animal sacrifices are not sanctioned by God since the true sacrifice which they formerly represented has already been accomplished on the Cross. As the Book of Hebrews says about such sacrifices after the Cross: "they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace." It is time to shed the apostasy which modern day Judaism has become. The time is short. Prepare the way for the Lord!"
Later, outside the Temple in Jerusalem:
The young man Shem Kolb is with his friends, now a large crowd, who had gone out to the mountains to see the remnants of the Russian forces which had been destroyed. They are discussing what Shem had learned from his Christian friend before his friend disappeared: "Look at all the things which have happened already. The Christian Bible has been shown to be correct about what would happen at the Rapture and in the time following. My Christian friend, who disappeared at the Rapture event, told me of these things. They were all correct. The Rabbi who has become a new believer is also correct. We Jews were on the wrong side of history. Now we are required to prepare the way for the Lord's return. There will be much to overcome. But we are the core group of new believers who will declare the gospel of Jesus Christ to the lost world."
A member of the group asks him "What must we do to become the 144,000 evangelists?  We have just recently become believers ourselves.  How do we accomplish this overwhelming task?"
Shem Kolb: I have been studying this issue intensely since the Vanishment event occurred.  I have found that things will unfold in two stages over seven years.  The Bible says that during the first 3 1/2 years there will be increasing disasters and persecution of believers.  After the first 3 1/2 years the Jewish believers in Israel must be ready to flee to the mountains outside of Israel when the statue of the Antichrist is put in the temple.  Those believer Jews who flee Israel must remain in hiding to become the core group to repopulate the world during the 1000 year reign of the Lord, called the Millennium.  While those believer Jews remain in the mountains during the second 3 1/2 years of the Tribulation, those Jews who become believers after the Midpoint must remain and train to fight the Antichrist's military forces.  There are therefore two very different sets of instructions, and each group must follow the instructions meant for them.  I have been studying a book that explains it all, called "The Future Times" which lays out the timeline of what will happen.  Here is what it says about this issue:"
"When the Rapture takes all believers off the earth, no qualified evangelists remain. Therefore God raises up a new cadre of evangelists at the beginning of the Tribulation, which are the 144,000 witnesses from Israel.  The 144,000 are Jews who believe in Christ as soon as they see the Rapture, since they will immediately grasp its significance and understand what it means.  The Rapture causes a great awakening on the earth among the Jews.  Almost immediately after the Rapture the 144,000 Jews believe in Jesus Christ and become the initial evangelists for the early part of the Tribulation.  Therefore the elect angels in charge of the weather judgments are told to hold off on disasters until evangelism gets established since God wants to offer every chance for salvation.  These new evangelists will have “the seal of the living God” which means they are given special divine protection.  The Holy Spirit will have departed from the earth, and since His sealing ministry is gone, a new form of divine sealing is given  to these 144,000 evangelists.  The great weather disasters will not begin until these 144,000 are in place and sealed, and the evangelization of the world has begun."
Shem and his friends agree that they want to be part of the initial 144,000 believer Jews who will carry the Word of the Lord to Israel and the entire world.  They declare their faith in their Messiah Jesus Christ and pledge their lives to the cause of evangelizing the world.
As they set out on their mission they know that their path will be a difficult one.
CHAPTER 9
ECONOMIC DISASTER -- THE HORSEMEN RIDE

Back in LA, news anchor Jill Steiner cannot sleep and is up early reading from the book "The Future Times:"
"The third horseman now appears, which is economic disaster.
Revelation 6:5 “When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. 6 “Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, “Two pounds of wheat for a day’s wages, and six pounds of barley for a day’s wages, and do not damage the oil and the wine!” ”
Economic depression and resultant famine is the Black Horse. As a result of the first two horses, the world spirals quickly into worldwide depression. Scarcity and famine will grip the entire world for the remainder of the Tribulation. The scales show how precious food becomes during this intense global economic depression. The Antichrist will parcel out food, goods, and services to his followers and withhold them from those who refuse to submit to him by taking his Mark of the Beast.
The Lord is heard saying here that a day's wages will only buy a quart of wheat grains, or three quarts of barley grains, barely enough for a family to survive on lower quality food, and with nothing left over for anything else. And the olive oil and wine (luxury foods during a depression) will be highly sought after by those fortunate few who can afford them. Life is reduced to a subsistence level with people living hand to mouth worldwide."
Having lost track of time, Jill stops reading and hurries off to work. In the studio she starts her morning news report:
"Good morning LA.  Or is it?  Food shortages have become widespread and food riots are occurring everywhere.  We take you now to downtown LA where this video shows armed bands of looters in various parts of the city."  As the video plays, Jill talks with her producer. She tells him this is due to the onerous restrictions put in place by President Antivon.  The producer tells Jill to be very careful about what she says, because there are eyes everywhere watching for anyone questioning President Antivon's policies.  Jill agrees that these are dangerous times to have an opinion.  But in the final moments of her morning news show Jill looks at the clock and sees she needs to fill 15 seconds before the next show starts.  Jill looks at the camera and says "Am I the only one who looks at all of these disasters and sees the predictions from the Book of Revelation?  Do you see it?  I think we should all take a look at what the Bible has predicted about the Future Times.  That is the way I see it."  As the show ends her producer warns: "Jill, be very careful.  The authorities can shut us down any time they chose to do so."
Later that day, President Antivon institutes new measures, taking even more power to himself. Congress has now become just a shadow government organization, and with Martial Law and a State of Emergency in effect the Supreme Court is hamstrung. Anyone questioning the actions of President Antivon winds up fired, imprisoned or found dead.
At home that evening Jill Steiner, with the words of her producer still ringing in her ears, continues to read from the book "The Future Times."
"Now the Lord opens the 4th Seal, the Pale Horse of Death, announced by the fourth Seraph.
Revelation 6:7 “When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” 8 I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.”
Death is the fourth horsemen, naturally resulting from the first three. Survival during the Tribulation is difficult, with the previous three horsemen causing death on a massive scale. A large part of the earth's population will die during these seven years from war, famine, wild animals, and increased illnesses, and many others will die from specific judgments during the Bowl and Trumpet judgments.  The Pale Horse alone will take 25% of the earth's population, over 1.5 billion people.  Then other judgments in the later Seals will kill even more people so that from the start of the Tribulation until the end it appears that more than 90% of the earth's population will die."
As Jill puts down her book she contemplates the words "more than 90% of the earth's population will die."  After a rough mental calculation Jill says out loud "that is many billions of people!"  Of the people she sees on a daily basis only 1 in 10 will live out another seven years?  She shudders as she looks at the book lying on her table, the words echoing in her head.  Somehow she knows it is true.
Trying to think of other things, Jill makes a mental note not to incite the authorities to investigate her co-workers. She does not want to put them at risk. The authorities have threatened to destroy the lives of any who oppose them. It is not just her life, it is the lives of all who depend on her doing what the authorities require. The news has become just a propaganda machine for the authorities. But what is right? Jill goes to sleep wondering how she can continue to ignore speaking openly about what she has come to believe as the truth. But she is conflicted by the need to support her friends and co-workers. She finds no easy answers, only more questions.
Jill decides to go out and meet with several of her friends. They have been asking, but she has repeatedly declined. It had been several months since they last went out together, so they agree to meet at a bistro near Jill's apartment. Once there, they catch up on what they have been doing, their careers, and so on. Then the talk turns to politics. It could not be avoided in the current climate.
Jill's friend Tara asks: "So Jill, where do you stand on the new President? Do you think he is really a god or something?"
Jill: "Oh, I don't think much about it. But it seems a bit of a stretch to me."
Tara: "But he was resurrected, right? I mean, he died and then he came back to life. That is something god-like, right?"
Jill: "Technically not resurrected. That is what people believe happens at -- well -- the Rapture which supposedly just happened. Or maybe it was just a Vanishment. I don't know. But being dead and then revived is something else. Maybe resuscitation would be a better word."
Tara: "The rest of us were talking before you arrived. We all believe he is some kind of a god or something. It is so cool, and he will have power from the Harmonics of the Universe to heal the planet. It is all so exiting! We can live out our lives now on a healed earth, instead of dying from the rising oceans and heat and stuff. I mean, only a "denier" would oppose our President."
Jill: "Whatever you want to believe. I simply have my doubts."
Tara: "But we believe it. So we don't know why you wouldn't believe it, too. It is obvious to the rest of us. Why can't you see what we see? We thought you were our friend."
Jill: "OK, so you believe it. Fine. Let's just skip it."
Tara: "That is not the point. This is one of the most important issues of our time. We now have a man with god-like powers who can solve the problems of the earth and also make our lives better all-around -- we don't see how you could miss it. I mean, that is really weird of you. This is a salvation we can actually put into practical use. Don't you believe in it?"
Jill: "Salvation of the world by him? I doubt that. We hardly know anything about our new President, yet you already believe he has supernatural powers to solve the problems of the world? Count me out of this little fantasy. I have a headache. I'll be leaving now. Bye."
Jill's friends shake their heads and whisper to each other as Jill quickly departs.
