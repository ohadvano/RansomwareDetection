I wipe my eyes with the palm of my hands to feel that my face is burning.
I hear my heart beating rapidly inside my chest, and I start to notice that I'm struggling to breathe properly.
I stand on my feet to work my way towards the bathroom when suddenly I feel a stabbing pain in my stomach. It was like my insides were being twisted and pulled.
I pull the bathroom door open and balance myself on the sink.
I look in the mirror to see myself completely drenched in sweat.
Oh no...It's happening! What do I do!?
My head starts to throb as the pain in my stomach becomes too excruciating to cope with.
The more I try to stop the agonizing pain, I feel the most intense agony searing into my lower back, and all I can do is scream.
The pain becomes worse whenever I try to fight it, and straight away I feel nausea creeping up my throat. I double over and vomit violently to see black liquid coating the edges of the toilet.
