Ryder sighs. “Tell me something I don't know.”
“We tried to calm her down last night but every time we tried to get a word out, she'd hit us, and for a girl she can actually hit pretty hard.”
“You're such a pussy.” Bane chuckles.
Kellan looks taken aback. “Says the one who just stood there and didn't do shit.”
Bane shakes his head. “You don't get girls do you, Kellan? You let them talk for however long they need to, then when their rant is over that's when you talk.” Bane gets out of the car followed by Kellan.
Ryder turns to me and smiles brightly and places his hand gently on my knee. “You okay?” Something tells me that he's asking me if I'm okay after what happened last night.
I smile back at him. “Never better.” “I didn't hurt you, right?”
I lean forward in the passenger seat and press my lips against his. “It did hurt, but only for a little while.”
“Any regrets?”
