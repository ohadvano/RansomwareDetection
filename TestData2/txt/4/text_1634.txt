I roll my eyes. “Sam, open the door.”
She unlocks the door and murmurs. “I wish that a wolf found me attractive enough to sleep with me.” She sighs in disappointment. “'What is happening to the world?”
When I arrive at my home, I call in sick at work and take out today's homework. I take out the book Mr. Edmund gave for us today and start reading. The story centres on a father and his complicated relationship with his troubled teenaged boy.
From the very first page, I'm so engrossed by the story that I don't hear the phone ringing. I leave the book on the coffee table and hastily walk to the phone.
I pick it up but silence is met on the other end. “Hello?” I ask.
There's only silence. “Hello?” I repeat.
The sound of my mother's voice speaks. “You need to come to the hospital, honey.”
I frown even though she can't see me. “Is everything okay?”
“I need you to come here right now!”
