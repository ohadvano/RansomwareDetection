Reporter: "So you think Prime Minister Garlock is the False Prophet who supports the Antichrist who you say is President Antivon? Are you serious?"
Rabbi Cohen: "Yes, very serious.  The False Prophet is referred to in several ways throughout the Bible: 1) False Prophet (Matthew 24:24; Revelation 19:20); 2) Beast out of the land (Revelation 13:11-18); and 3) Dan the Serpent (Genesis 49:16-18)."
"And Revelation 13:12 says “It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been  healed. 13 And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people. 14 Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.”
"So this verse says there will be some sort of "false resurrection" of the Antichrist, although we do not yet know what that means. I would expect that we will soon find out.
"The False Prophet's alliance with the Antichrist is two-fold, both as puppet ruler in Israel and as a religious leader, and he will exercise full authority on behalf of the Antichrist. The False Prophet will perform pseudo miracles under the power of demons, including as it says here “causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth”. The two Beasts work together to do Satan's work in establishing and promoting the worldwide false religious system where the Antichrist is the deity and the False Prophet is his number one prophet and keeper of the false religion. Again we see how Satan tries to mimic God's truth by substituting falsehood to deceive the masses. The near-death and false resurrection of the Antichrist will be used by the False Prophet as a marketing tool to promote him to the masses as a deity, which is why the Abomination of Desolation idol – a statue of the Antichrist -- is set up in the temple in Jerusalem at the direction of the False Prophet. This idol statue of the Antichrist was described by Daniel:
Daniel 9:27 -- “He [Antichrist] will confirm a covenant with many [Israel] for one ‘seven’ [Tribulation 7 years]. In the middle of the ‘seven’ he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end [Second Advent] that is decreed is poured out on him.”
Rabbi Cohen concludes: "Therefore the False Prophet is a tool of the Antichrist to promote him as a god to the unbelievers of Israel. Many will be deceived because of the pseudo- miracles the Antichrist appears to perform, along with the message of healing the earth and eliminating the undesirables. And the False Prophet will be the one who sells these lies to the people of Israel."
The Reporter goes away shaking his head.
CHAPTER 7
ANTICHRIST AND FALSE RELIGION

At the White House the staff is scurrying as President Antivon decides to go out for dinner to his favorite restaurant. He has not been able to do so since becoming President. As he arrives at the restaurant and begins walking up the sidewalk he is targeted for assassination. A knife- wielding attacker bursts out of the crowd yelling "Die, Antichrist" and manages to stab President Antivon in the chest. The attacker is immediately killed by Secret Service agents.
President Antivon is rushed to George Washington University Hospital, and after attempts to revive him is declared dead. The sheet is pulled up over him as the Chief Medical Officer goes to the briefing room and begins to tell the nation that President Antivon has been killed. The Press outside is also notified, and the news spreads quickly. As the briefing continues an Aide comes into the room where the body is laying and sees movement. As he begins yelling, the doctors are urgently called back and President Antivon is found to be alive and is revived.
After several minutes of the world thinking President Antivon is dead, news that he is alive creates euphoric celebrations worldwide. Rumors spread of a "resurrection" from the dead, slowly at first, then a frenzy of press activity declares it is a "miracle" and "a sign of our impending salvation." President Antivon instantly gains a god-like stature among his loyal followers. News announcers declare "He is the One we have been waiting for to deliver us, and to deliver the earth. He is indeed a god among us."
Crowds in Times Square go from sobbing to cheering wildly at the news of the "resurrection" of President Antivon. Everyone heard what they wanted to hear. Climate change will finally be resolved by this god-like man who can even cheat death. The world believes it has a new savior who will end climate change, implement world peace and provide prosperity under a new world order, and stop the spread of what they view as "Christian moralism."
After a short recovery, President Antivon quickly acts to consolidate even more power. The military will now be used to enforce the new laws requiring compliance with his climate priorities. Christians must be controlled, stopped or eliminated entirely. The internal police must be expanded. Most citizens, but not all, cheer and celebrate the new stronger initiatives.
At the Capitol Building Senators talk among themselves about the drastic changes being made by President Antivon without consent of Congress:
Senator Anders:  "The changes being made are unconstitutional and frightening.  I am not on board with this shredding of our Constitution.  We lost 16 Senators to the Vanishment and they were ones who would have helped stop this madness.  But they are not here to help, and the replacement process is uncertain and has stalled.  What are we going to do?"
Senator Farrow: "Who would have thought that it was the Christians who have vanished who were holding the country together? They were the core of the good and decent people who believed in the principles our country was founded on. As long as they were here this sudden degradation of society could not have happened, but now that they are gone the majority of those who remain are ready to accept the radical leftist and anti-Constitutional policies of President Antivon. He is lawless, but what can be done? The citizens who would have stood in the way are gone."
Senator Davis: "President Antivon's measures have declared lawful people criminals, and criminals are now celebrated as heroes. After the former Christians vanished, the new Christians were declared to be enemies of the State. President Antivon is trampling the rights of all good and decent citizens, especially these new Christians."
Senator Ford: "There are rumblings that the new President is the one called the Antichrist. I now believe it myself. Something must be done or he will lead us straight to Armageddon."
Senator Davis: "No wonder he hates Christians so much. Although I had never believed it before, the Bible says there would be a man like this. He is mad, and is lawlessly implementing his madness. We must stop him from further shredding the Constitution or he will destroy our country. But the masses are swayed by his soaring rhetoric and lies. We need to meet tomorrow and discuss details, but we must be very discreet." They all agree to meet the following day at a secret location.
Later that day, the four Senators are arrested and charged with treason.
The next day President Antivon addresses the nation:
"Today I am furthering my previous Declaration of Martial Law and expanding on the National State of Emergency to focus on combating global climate change. If we do not fight global climate change, my advisers say the earth will not survive even seven more years. This is the real global war which is necessary. Those who do not believe and join will be shunned. This includes primarily the new Christians who are climate change deniers, and also do not believe in LGBTQI propositions, gender choice, or other progressive ideas. Those who do not renounce such hate must be dealt with harshly. I am implementing a system which will only allow those who join our fight to buy and sell in commerce. Anyone who is not with us is against us, and especially the Christians if they refuse to renounce their backward and hate- filled beliefs."
Watching President Antivon in his conference room in Silicon Valley the CEO of a social media giant says to his staff who have gathered to see what President Antivon would say: "This is the opportunity we have been hoping for. We will muster all of our power to support the President's initiatives. Make sure all employees know that our priority is to save the world, and to do it we will do whatever is necessary to support President Antivon's policies. The Martial Law and emergency order will help cut through all the red tape. We need to get on this fast, so let's get to work and change the world."
In the streets many celebrate President Antivon's initiatives. Each one hears what they want to hear from his speech. Many think they will personally benefit since Christians will be forced to "convert" to the new way of the State. A leader of the assembled crowd is heard saying: "The ones who vanished needed to go. They stood in the way of the progressive society and the healing of the earth. With them gone, we can now move ahead into a future filled with great promise, and without all the other things those Christians perpetrated on society." And the prospect of taxing wealth from the new Christians who are being declared outcasts and will soon be dispatched in large numbers also helps deepen their admiration for President Antivon. The average person sees him as the one they have been waiting for. To them he is a savior. He is a god.
But elsewhere there is opposition to the power seizure of President Antivon. New believers see him for what he is. He is the Antichrist discussed in the Bible. He is the one who will bring only satanic influence and destruction. Believers meeting in secret all over the country commit to opposing the Antichrist. They know the Mark of the Beast is coming. They know this man will lead them to Armageddon. They know they must oppose him and trust in God to deliver them. But they also know it will be a hard road to travel. Secret internet groups are set up to support the pockets of believers in the US and elsewhere. But they must be very careful. They realize the forces of the Antichrist will seek them out to shut them down and eventually will try to destroy them.
CHAPTER 8
THE JEWISH AWAKENING

Scene in Israel at a Synagogue in Jerusalem:
Rabbi Cohen of northern Israel is visiting Jerusalem to address worshipers: "My friends, we Jews were wrong. We missed our Messiah. He has come, and we missed it. He is Jesus, the One our Christian friends worship, and we missed His coming to us. [Many start to leave the Synagogue, but many others stay.] It is time to change our way of thinking and accept Jesus as our Savior. He was the One the Torah and Prophets spoke of. He was the One who will return for His believers in just seven short years. Inside the Temples in Israel the apostate Jews who still refuse to believe in their Messiah have re-instituted animal sacrifices. That is a blasphemy to the Lord! The Lord Jesus Christ was the only sacrifice, and ended the animal sacrifices. Our rituals and animal sacrifices are not sanctioned by God since the true sacrifice which they formerly represented has already been accomplished on the Cross. As the Book of Hebrews says about such sacrifices after the Cross: "they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace." It is time to shed the apostasy which modern day Judaism has become. The time is short. Prepare the way for the Lord!"
Later, outside the Temple in Jerusalem:
The young man Shem Kolb is with his friends, now a large crowd, who had gone out to the mountains to see the remnants of the Russian forces which had been destroyed. They are discussing what Shem had learned from his Christian friend before his friend disappeared: "Look at all the things which have happened already. The Christian Bible has been shown to be correct about what would happen at the Rapture and in the time following. My Christian friend, who disappeared at the Rapture event, told me of these things. They were all correct. The Rabbi who has become a new believer is also correct. We Jews were on the wrong side of history. Now we are required to prepare the way for the Lord's return. There will be much to overcome. But we are the core group of new believers who will declare the gospel of Jesus Christ to the lost world."
A member of the group asks him "What must we do to become the 144,000 evangelists?  We have just recently become believers ourselves.  How do we accomplish this overwhelming task?"
Shem Kolb: I have been studying this issue intensely since the Vanishment event occurred.  I have found that things will unfold in two stages over seven years.  The Bible says that during the first 3 1/2 years there will be increasing disasters and persecution of believers.  After the first 3 1/2 years the Jewish believers in Israel must be ready to flee to the mountains outside of Israel when the statue of the Antichrist is put in the temple.  Those believer Jews who flee Israel must remain in hiding to become the core group to repopulate the world during the 1000 year reign of the Lord, called the Millennium.  While those believer Jews remain in the mountains during the second 3 1/2 years of the Tribulation, those Jews who become believers after the Midpoint must remain and train to fight the Antichrist's military forces.  There are therefore two very different sets of instructions, and each group must follow the instructions meant for them.  I have been studying a book that explains it all, called "The Future Times" which lays out the timeline of what will happen.  Here is what it says about this issue:"
"When the Rapture takes all believers off the earth, no qualified evangelists remain. Therefore God raises up a new cadre of evangelists at the beginning of the Tribulation, which are the 144,000 witnesses from Israel.  The 144,000 are Jews who believe in Christ as soon as they see the Rapture, since they will immediately grasp its significance and understand what it means.  The Rapture causes a great awakening on the earth among the Jews.  Almost immediately after the Rapture the 144,000 Jews believe in Jesus Christ and become the initial evangelists for the early part of the Tribulation.  Therefore the elect angels in charge of the weather judgments are told to hold off on disasters until evangelism gets established since God wants to offer every chance for salvation.  These new evangelists will have “the seal of the living God” which means they are given special divine protection.  The Holy Spirit will have departed from the earth, and since His sealing ministry is gone, a new form of divine sealing is given  to these 144,000 evangelists.  The great weather disasters will not begin until these 144,000 are in place and sealed, and the evangelization of the world has begun."
Shem and his friends agree that they want to be part of the initial 144,000 believer Jews who will carry the Word of the Lord to Israel and the entire world.  They declare their faith in their Messiah Jesus Christ and pledge their lives to the cause of evangelizing the world.
As they set out on their mission they know that their path will be a difficult one.
CHAPTER 9
ECONOMIC DISASTER -- THE HORSEMEN RIDE

Back in LA, news anchor Jill Steiner cannot sleep and is up early reading from the book "The Future Times:"
"The third horseman now appears, which is economic disaster.
Revelation 6:5 “When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. 6 “Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, “Two pounds of wheat for a day’s wages, and six pounds of barley for a day’s wages, and do not damage the oil and the wine!” ”
Economic depression and resultant famine is the Black Horse. As a result of the first two horses, the world spirals quickly into worldwide depression. Scarcity and famine will grip the entire world for the remainder of the Tribulation. The scales show how precious food becomes during this intense global economic depression. The Antichrist will parcel out food, goods, and services to his followers and withhold them from those who refuse to submit to him by taking his Mark of the Beast.
The Lord is heard saying here that a day's wages will only buy a quart of wheat grains, or three quarts of barley grains, barely enough for a family to survive on lower quality food, and with nothing left over for anything else. And the olive oil and wine (luxury foods during a depression) will be highly sought after by those fortunate few who can afford them. Life is reduced to a subsistence level with people living hand to mouth worldwide."
Having lost track of time, Jill stops reading and hurries off to work. In the studio she starts her morning news report:
"Good morning LA.  Or is it?  Food shortages have become widespread and food riots are occurring everywhere.  We take you now to downtown LA where this video shows armed bands of looters in various parts of the city."  As the video plays, Jill talks with her producer. She tells him this is due to the onerous restrictions put in place by President Antivon.  The producer tells Jill to be very careful about what she says, because there are eyes everywhere watching for anyone questioning President Antivon's policies.  Jill agrees that these are dangerous times to have an opinion.  But in the final moments of her morning news show Jill looks at the clock and sees she needs to fill 15 seconds before the next show starts.  Jill looks at the camera and says "Am I the only one who looks at all of these disasters and sees the predictions from the Book of Revelation?  Do you see it?  I think we should all take a look at what the Bible has predicted about the Future Times.  That is the way I see it."  As the show ends her producer warns: "Jill, be very careful.  The authorities can shut us down any time they chose to do so."
Later that day, President Antivon institutes new measures, taking even more power to himself. Congress has now become just a shadow government organization, and with Martial Law and a State of Emergency in effect the Supreme Court is hamstrung. Anyone questioning the actions of President Antivon winds up fired, imprisoned or found dead.
At home that evening Jill Steiner, with the words of her producer still ringing in her ears, continues to read from the book "The Future Times."
"Now the Lord opens the 4th Seal, the Pale Horse of Death, announced by the fourth Seraph.
Revelation 6:7 “When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” 8 I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.”
Death is the fourth horsemen, naturally resulting from the first three. Survival during the Tribulation is difficult, with the previous three horsemen causing death on a massive scale. A large part of the earth's population will die during these seven years from war, famine, wild animals, and increased illnesses, and many others will die from specific judgments during the Bowl and Trumpet judgments.  The Pale Horse alone will take 25% of the earth's population, over 1.5 billion people.  Then other judgments in the later Seals will kill even more people so that from the start of the Tribulation until the end it appears that more than 90% of the earth's population will die."
As Jill puts down her book she contemplates the words "more than 90% of the earth's population will die."  After a rough mental calculation Jill says out loud "that is many billions of people!"  Of the people she sees on a daily basis only 1 in 10 will live out another seven years?  She shudders as she looks at the book lying on her table, the words echoing in her head.  Somehow she knows it is true.
Trying to think of other things, Jill makes a mental note not to incite the authorities to investigate her co-workers. She does not want to put them at risk. The authorities have threatened to destroy the lives of any who oppose them. It is not just her life, it is the lives of all who depend on her doing what the authorities require. The news has become just a propaganda machine for the authorities. But what is right? Jill goes to sleep wondering how she can continue to ignore speaking openly about what she has come to believe as the truth. But she is conflicted by the need to support her friends and co-workers. She finds no easy answers, only more questions.
Jill decides to go out and meet with several of her friends. They have been asking, but she has repeatedly declined. It had been several months since they last went out together, so they agree to meet at a bistro near Jill's apartment. Once there, they catch up on what they have been doing, their careers, and so on. Then the talk turns to politics. It could not be avoided in the current climate.
Jill's friend Tara asks: "So Jill, where do you stand on the new President? Do you think he is really a god or something?"
Jill: "Oh, I don't think much about it. But it seems a bit of a stretch to me."
Tara: "But he was resurrected, right? I mean, he died and then he came back to life. That is something god-like, right?"
Jill: "Technically not resurrected. That is what people believe happens at -- well -- the Rapture which supposedly just happened. Or maybe it was just a Vanishment. I don't know. But being dead and then revived is something else. Maybe resuscitation would be a better word."
Tara: "The rest of us were talking before you arrived. We all believe he is some kind of a god or something. It is so cool, and he will have power from the Harmonics of the Universe to heal the planet. It is all so exiting! We can live out our lives now on a healed earth, instead of dying from the rising oceans and heat and stuff. I mean, only a "denier" would oppose our President."
Jill: "Whatever you want to believe. I simply have my doubts."
Tara: "But we believe it. So we don't know why you wouldn't believe it, too. It is obvious to the rest of us. Why can't you see what we see? We thought you were our friend."
Jill: "OK, so you believe it. Fine. Let's just skip it."
Tara: "That is not the point. This is one of the most important issues of our time. We now have a man with god-like powers who can solve the problems of the earth and also make our lives better all-around -- we don't see how you could miss it. I mean, that is really weird of you. This is a salvation we can actually put into practical use. Don't you believe in it?"
Jill: "Salvation of the world by him? I doubt that. We hardly know anything about our new President, yet you already believe he has supernatural powers to solve the problems of the world? Count me out of this little fantasy. I have a headache. I'll be leaving now. Bye."
Jill's friends shake their heads and whisper to each other as Jill quickly departs.
Back at her apartment Jill thinks about how she has always been very compatible with these friends. She has known them for years. Now she is seen as "weird" by them. It was a change for Jill because she was always seen as being among the "in crowd." She was always smart and pretty and cool. She thought about the new pressures which had developed, and what that would mean to people. Jill is beginning to understand how people are being driven apart by the new politics. She wondered if she really was weird, as Tara had said. "Too much thinking" she thought. "I really do have a headache now. I need some sleep."
As she awakens the next morning Jill turns on the market news. The anchors are grim as they discuss the worldwide famine which has already killed millions of people. The video footage from Africa, India and South America is depressing. The food chain has been completely disrupted and the most vulnerable are dying in droves. Those who do not die from starvation are killed by the gangs of thugs who steal their remaining food. There has been almost no rain anywhere on earth for months. The heat is oppressive and bakes the already scorched earth. The seed planted last Spring failed to sprout in many areas or the world. It will be a long, hot summer. Jill changes the channel. Re-runs of "I Love Lucy" give a short respite from the endless bad news. It is the episode where Lucy works in a chocolate factory and the conveyor belt goes haywire. Oh, for the days when we could enjoy such frivolous things. But the reality is far too depressing and grim. She heads off to work dreading the breaking news she will need to deliver. And with good reason.
CHAPTER 10
WORLD-WIDE WAR

At the European Office of the Western Alliance President Antivon is meeting with Alliance staff members and military advisers. "It is time to bring more nations into our Alliance. We have been trying to negotiate with many of them, but that has proved fruitless. We have no option but to take them over by force." The next day the Western Alliance declares war on several neighboring countries which are not currently part of the Alliance.
President Antivon masses his coalition armies in preparation for a military offensive on multiple fronts.  His 11 nation confederation has control of the military forces of the US and EU, making it the largest military force on earth, double the size of any other.  Having already consolidated his control over the 11 nation confederation, he turns his focus to attacking nations on the borders of the Western Alliance.  They fall quickly and easily, one after another until his empire includes all of North and South America, and all of Europe and parts of south Asia.  It also expands to include nations which border Russia and the Middle East.  He has his eyes on Africa next.  The Russian and Chinese alliances, having been alarmed by the Western Alliance aggression, are worried -- and with good reason.  President Antivon has made it clear that he will institute a New Worldwide Order with himself as Supreme Leader.  His stature as a god has grown among the people along with his successes.  After a successful invasion, the first thing which appears in that conquered country is a statue of President Antivon.  A god must have a statue to be worshiped.
Over a period of months, country after country falls in rapid succession.  The wars are bloody as nations resist.  Millions of people are killed.  In just eight months the Western Alliance has expanded to 9 more countries.  The death toll stands at 28 million in just 18 months from these wars, and that number is still rising.
With his control over the Western Alliance established, the Vatican has refused to submit their own independent authority to President Antivon whose hatred for Christianity runs deep. President Antivon is present as his forces storm the Vatican with armed joint troops, which quickly overwhelm the Swiss Guards. President Antivon makes his way into the Vatican inner chamber and comes to where the former Pope's Chief of Staff, or Camerlengo, is sitting, acting as an interim Pope in certain respects due to the chaos after the Vanishment, the previous Pope and potential successors having gone in the Vanishment. Antivon knocks the Camerlengo's hat off and says "Get out." The chief aide tries to intervene and is shot dead.
Antivon: "Now Popey, or whatever you think you are, get out. This is not your place any more. I am the one who has come to save the world. I am the one they have been waiting for."
Camerlengo: "You blasphemer. You will die in hell." He is shot dead by President Antivon's security forces.
The Vatican staff members are rounded up and escorted out. President Antivon sits down on the Pope's Throne. "This fits me well. A god is now on this Throne, not a man in a funny hat. I am renaming Vatican City as "Babylon" in honor of that great ancient city. Now let's really change the world."
Before Antivon departs, he appoints a trusted "Ambassador to Rome" to run the world-wide religious system from Babylon with Antivon as its god. He tells his new man in Babylon: "You must ensure that I am seen as a god, and worshiped as a god. You must not fail me. This is very important to me, and I would take any failure personally. Understood?"  The Ambassador replies, "Understood, I will not fail you." Antivon: "Good, see to it that the Christians pay dearly for refusing to worship me." Antivon departs, and the Vatican infrastructure is turned from Christian to promoting Antivon as a god. It seemed brilliant to take over an existing infrastructure rather than build one from scratch. The new system in Babylon was up and running within a week, dominating social media with Antivon's propaganda.
The remaining alliances of countries outside the Western Alliance have now consolidated into the Russian Alliance, the China Alliance, and the Southern Alliance made up of Muslim countries in the Middle East and North Africa. These Alliances all formed as a reaction to the expansion of the Western Alliance, and many former enemy nations are now in alliances in opposition to the Western Alliance. The stage is set for a full-scale world war.
For those nations not in alliances, regional conflicts which have been brewing for a long time erupt into open warfare. There is no world order on which they depend, so they proceed to engage their long-time enemies over age-old disputes in open warfare. The bloodshed is extreme as these long-held hatreds play out in barbaric ways. Without a system of law, order, and justice in these formerly Third World countries, their people are becoming little more than savages. Justice is no longer a term they understand. Gangs of armed thugs rule local regions as vengeance and domination become the primary goals. Murder becomes the primary reason for death, surpassing the famine. A new slave trade develops as these nations sell their enslaved enemies into the four world Alliances, which are eager to obtain them. The slave trade becomes one of the more lucrative businesses in the non-alliance countries.
At LANX Jill Steiner is reporting on the world on the brink of a world war. After discussing the Alliances which have been established in opposition to one another, she discusses the regional issues which have been going on for several months now:
Jill: "China has invaded Taiwan and taken it over. With no one to help them anymore, Taiwan was left defenseless. In south Asia, India and Pakistan have begun crossing into each other's territory and have engaged in several bloody conflicts.  The numbers of dead are growing daily. The African continent is not immune, and food wars among a number of African nations are ongoing. Iran has invaded Iraq again -- how many times has that happened now? Terrorists have become emboldened and are attacking at will. The world is in turmoil." Jill ends her broadcast with a sense of desperation. Those who promised peace and stability have instead resorted to senseless wars and despicable inhumanity.
It is now 1 year after the Vanishment.
CHAPTER 11
DEATH -- THE NEW NORMAL

Jill Steiner is riding the Metrorail returning from an interview, and is reading from her book.
"The Four Horsemen are now firmly in place. Millions have died as a result. Now, the 5th Seal introduces a different type of historical trend, which is persecution of believers, including martyrdom on a large scale. This Seal is not a divine judgment, but a “false judgment” caused by man upon God's Christian believers simply because of their faith. Only The Lord Jesus Christ has earned the right to judge, so this usurpation of His role by unqualified mankind will result in judgment of the murderers later during the Tribulation. Man's inhumanity to man will reach a peak during the Tribulation. So much for the continuous improvement of mankind, which is a myth.
Revelation 6:9 “When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained.”
Believers who hold firm to their faith will be persecuted and often killed during the Tribulation. Those who refuse to worship the Antichrist are hunted down and become martyrs. Since the Rapture removed all believers before the Tribulation began, all these believers will be relatively new to their faith. That makes this an impressive display of faith by these believers during this time of great persecution. And that is the purpose for God allowing martyrdom for a while, to serve as a witness to a hardened world of unbelievers so some may turn to Christ and believe as a result of this intense form of testimony.
Revelation 6:10 “They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?” 11 Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters, were killed just as they had been.”
The prayers of the martyrs are heard by the Lord, but they must be patient while God's plan plays out. Note that God has ordained that a “full number” of believers will be martyrs during the Tribulation, meaning a specific large number. As always, God has a time and manner decreed for the death of each of His own. But those who kill His believers will be severely judged. This persecution and killing of believers is one reason for the intensity of the disasters and judgments on the earth during this time, especially in the Trumpet and Bowl Judgments as will be noted later."
Jill is surprised by how the Bible would predict things so precisely.  Most non-legitimate sources would be very vague.  Especially about things 2000 years in the future.  But the Bible is specific.  That would lead one to believe it is sure about the results.  Jill reads on:
"Seal 6 is opened revealing massive earthquakes, enormous tidal waves/tsunamis and explosive volcanoes on a regular basis. This disruption of normal earthly events and processes will continue at intense levels throughout the remainder of the Tribulation.
Revelation 6:12 “I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,”
Soot from the earthquakes and resulting volcanoes will blacken the sky and hide the sun during the day and turn the moon red by night. Visibility will be greatly reduced. Airline travel will become nearly impossible in the thick ash. Everything will be coated with ash and will require constant cleaning, but will never stay clean. Constant irritation will be the companion of people on earth as they struggle to simply survive in the dust and ash-filled air. The beauty of the earth is stripped away as everything becomes covered by ash and dust. People must wear masks as they go about on daily tasks. Life is getting difficult, but it will get much worse.
Revelation 6:13 “and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind.”
Large meteors falling to earth will become a routine event. Life on earth will become shortened for many as with a fig tree shaken hard and its unripe fruit falling too early to be of any value (unbelievers with no salvation).
Revelation 6:14 “The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.”
Two issues are discussed here. First, the atmosphere being rolled up suggests nuclear warfare, and secondly there will be massive earthquakes which will shift the tectonic plates of the earth on a larger scale than ever before in the history of the earth. The landscape will change as a result. All island dwellers will die."
Jill shudders to read the words on the page. It is about millions of lives. Can it be true? Would God do such a thing? And why?
The next day LANX anchor Jill Steiner is at work anchoring her morning news show:
"Good morning.  This is day 380 after the Vanishment.  We can barely keep up with reporting the disasters and terrible events around the world which have resulted in many millions of deaths.  Today is no exception, and here is an overview of what has happened during the past 24 hours:
A massive volcano eruption in Indonesia and an enormous tsunami washed over numerous islands killing an estimated 100,000 people."
Jill barely pauses at that awful statistic before continuing...
"Earthquakes have become more frequent and very powerful in South America.  One earthquake in Uyuni, Bolivia this week measured 9.2 and caused the gigantic Uyuni Salt Flats to disappear, along with the city of Uyuni.  Over 30,000 people are presumed dead."
"Five new volcanoes have appeared in the Greek island chain near the Milos volcano. They created new islands and now dwarf the older volcanoes on the Greek Islands, having risen to double the height of any previous volcano on the Greek islands."
"A highly contagious and previously unknown virus is sweeping through Asia, and after killing over 25,000 people during the past couple weeks is now spreading quickly throughout the Pacific region."
"A massive meteor fell to earth in central Australia in the Red Centre region near Alice Springs.  The impact of the meteor had the energy of twenty nuclear bombs going off at the same time.  Alice Springs and 15 other towns were completely destroyed.  Over 35,000 perished."
"In Yellowstone Park, Wyoming, the Yellowstone Basin super-volcano, although it was essentially a flat volcano, has erupted explosively. The "Kill Zone" covered most of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. The resulting ash has created near-total darkness across several of the northern US states. Yellowstone Park has ceased to exist, along with numerous cities and towns in the Kill Zone. The death toll is expected to be enormous."
"Following the Yellowstone eruption many of the dormant Pacific Basin "Ring of Fire" volcanoes have also erupted explosively."
"War between India and Pakistan has led to the use of tactical nuclear weapons by both sides. Several cities in both countries have been hit and the status of the people there is unknown.
Communications in that part of the world have been severely disrupted by the electromagnetic effects of the nuclear detonations."
"The Karthala volcano on the island nation of Cormoros off southern Africa near Mozambique exploded and reports of the island disappearing have reached us. The population of the island was estimated to be 750,000 people."
"The death toll from all the combined disasters during the past 24 hours is estimated to be in the tens of millions, and maybe many times more.  We just do not know how many have died."
"This video is just in to our newsroom showing the effects of the enormous tsunami which hit eastern India and washed over a mile inland."
As the video plays, Jill talks to her producer. "Remember that online video we played of the writer who predicted many years ago that these types of things would occur? That keeps going through my mind as I report them. This is all just too much disaster to have occurred randomly. I have been reading his book and have tried to find a Bible but most of them have been collected under orders from President Antivon. I don't know how I can go on covering these awful events on a daily basis. They are just too awful."
The video ends and Jill continues her coverage of the disasters, switching to the volcanic explosion in Indonesia.  "Reports indicate the volcano and middle part of the island of Sumatra are gone.  The sky is thick with ash and has turned blood-red for millions of square miles.  The ash cloud from this and other volcanic eruptions which have already occurred is expected to decrease sunlight to the earth's surface by at least 15% for years to come...More after this short break..."
A mandatory Public Service Announcement appears on-screen telling all Western Alliance residents that it is their duty to turn in any of their neighbors who waste energy, engage in acts of self-indulgence, or commit any infraction which would harm the Environment. Such things are prohibited as the most heinous acts of disregard for the planet, and is therefore forbidden for the good of us all. Thank you for your cooperation and good citizenship."
Off-air Jill whispers to herself "I think I will just puke if I hear that one more time." Producer Jack Ford cautions Jill to be very, very careful, since you cannot trust anyone anymore.
Things are getting so bad you should consider your friends as enemies. Trust no one. Jill ponders that thought as she is about to restart her news hour.
Jill: "We are back, and the news is not any better than when we left off. Here are the details.	"
Near the end of her broadcast time Jill is covering a story about how the rights of citizens have been severely restricted by the authorities. The endless State of Emergency and Declaration of Martial Law combined have given broad authority to the new Citizen's Police to interrogate and detain people without reason, especially for saying things "harmful to the State." Jill ends her news hour by saying: "These measures have turned honest citizens into criminals, while the real criminals are running the Citizen's Police in violation of the rights of individuals." As she takes off her microphone Jack Ford comes over to her and says "I expect we will hear from the authorities soon.  Jill, you simply need to understand that they can shut us down for saying what you just said. It doesn't matter if you are right any more, it is about power. The authorities have the power, and we no longer have any civil liberties. So although I agree with your thinking, we are vulnerable here. See you tomorrow."
In Israel, Shem and his group of 144,000 evangelists are conferencing by internet.  Shem leads the discussion by pointing out how the recent disasters were prophesied in the Bible. Shem encourages the faithful to remember that their mission is to evangelize, and that these disasters are designed to cause unbelievers to think about the gospel of salvation through Jesus Christ the only Savior.  The group must re-double their efforts to spread the Word of God to those who are lost and seeking meaning in these turbulent times.
Shem has a list of priorities for the group. He starts with making the message relevant to the suffering of the masses under the oppression of dictators. "People are dying from starvation, and their freedoms have been removed by the oppressors. They are seeking Truth -- real Truth. They know instinctively that there is Truth out there. Our task is to give it to them simply and consistently, without holding back, without watering it down, and without fear of the authorities. The spies of the authorities are everywhere. They seek to stop us.  They seek to eliminate us. They seek to prevent people from learning the Truth. Many of us will die because of the Truth. That is not our concern. Our eternal future is secure, and it cannot be taken away. But there are billions who are lost and need salvation. It is true that very few will believe. But we are after those few. Stay strong and focus on saving those few. Now here are your taskings for the week	"
Back in LA, Jill arrives at the news studio the next morning to find several stern looking individuals talking with news producer Jack Ford. They are obviously unhappy. As they see Jill enter the studio one of them comes over and tells her to come over to talk. Jack Ford introduces them as Citizen's Police officers. Jill knows what that means. One of the "officers" addresses Jill saying "We watched your news report yesterday. It was not particularly helpful to the State's attempts to ensure good order in the Western Alliance. You must remember  that you are allowed to broadcast only as long as we approve of what you say. Do you understand what I mean?" Before Jill can answer Jack Ford interjects "We both understand, and we will be more careful, right Jill?" Jill can only nod slightly. The men seem unconvinced but depart without another word. After they have left, Jack says "They are serious.  You did not hear all of what they said, but they obviously meant to scare me into compliance.  We must understand that right or wrong has been replaced with power vs powerless, and enforced by a group outside the legitimate local police. They said they will be watching even more carefully for any non-compliance with their so-called rules for good order, and it is whatever they say it is. I even asked for what rules we violated and they just sneered.  It sent a chill down my spine.  Anyway, time to get back to work.  But Jill, be very careful, please."  Jill agrees to try, but only because of Jack and her friends at the studio. She does not want to get any of them into trouble with these thugs.
After her broadcast is over Jill is back in her apartment thinking to herself how all these incidents she reports on during her news shows were mentioned in the book she has been reading from time to time. Later that night, Jill is once again reading the book "The Future Times." She recalls how the book was mentioned in the You Tube video which she had aired on the day the Vanishment occurred. How quickly things can turn from polite society to thugs running the lives of ordinary people. Law abiding citizens were turned into criminals overnight, while criminals became a Citizen's Police and are hailed as heroes of the State. It was so fast.  In retrospect she sees that the departure of the Christians led to this breakdown of society. They were the ones holding it all together.  They were the ones who believed in right and wrong, truth and lies, good and evil. So true. She resumes reading her book:
Revelation 6:15 “Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.”
No amount of human power, fame, fortune, or lack thereof will shield people from these disasters. There is no hiding in fallout shelters or elsewhere which can avoid these disasters. The great and small alike will suffer and die. But in general they will still refuse to look to God for their salvation. Instead, they pray to rocks:
Revelation 6:16 “They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!”
"This shows the degree of hardness of these unbelievers. They will understand that God is judging them, but will still refuse to believe in Jesus Christ for salvation. They will not pray to God but will pray to rocks to spare them from God, and to bring them death and oblivion. But even if they die, there is no oblivion. Their eternal future will be even worse."
Revelation 6:17 “For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can withstand it?” The disasters will break the will of unbelievers, but even so most refuse to become believers.  The last verse of Chapter 6 asks “who can withstand it?”  The answer is only believers with an understanding of Biblical doctrines in their souls can stand in the face of what is happening, and what is yet to come.  Only believers can stand since they know their future in Heaven is secure, and their life on earth is in God's hands.  This verse also looks forward to the Second Advent of Jesus Christ, the “great day of their wrath” when believers will be delivered and all unbelievers will be removed from the earth.  And as difficult as the first half of the Tribulation will be as a result of these six Seals being opened, the last half will be much worse.
"The first six Seals have now been opened. They will be opened starting early during the Tribulation with the Four Horsemen and the effects will continue throughout the seven year period..."
As Jill reads, her phone rings. She sees it is her mother calling. "Hi Mom." Mom: "Hi, Dear. Hey listen. I need to talk to you about something very important. My friends at the synagogue and I have been reading and looking up a lot of information. We have all concluded that we Jews missed our Messiah. It is like the blinders have fallen off many of us because of the Vanishment -- I mean, the Rapture. It has caused us to see more clearly. The Bible even says this would happen to Jews. Your father is also with us on this issue. I just had to tell you. I think you should also look at this in a new way.  We were wrong for so long.  But it is not too late. Many of us now believe."
Jill: "I believe that is true, Mom. We did miss the Messiah. It was the Rapture we just witnessed. This is now the Great Tribulation. I believe it now. But what will we do? It is all so scary. I do not know how I will hold up under the pressure." Mom replies: "Dear, we are now on the right side of history. The Truth is our guide. Follow the Truth of the Word of God...be strong."
At the Israeli Parliament, Prime Minister Garlock has just formed his new coalition giving him an even stronger majority necessary to exert increased power over Israel. Garlock is known as a secular leftist with radical views on many world issues. His mistrust of traditional Judaism and also for Christian beliefs are well known. Garlock addresses the Parliament:
"Israel must more closely embrace the Western Alliance and President Antivon who shares my views of government. Therefore, Israel must become a more complete partner with the Western Alliance on the world stage." He goes on to lay out his far-leftist plans for Israel, to become an even closer military and economic partner with the Western Alliance. It will include relinquishing a significant amount of Israeli sovereignty to the Western Alliance.
President Antivon calls Israel PM, who is the primary supporter of his image as a god. The two discuss his agenda. They agree to set up a statue of President Antivon in the Temple in Jerusalem. Prime Minister Garlock agrees to make the arrangements and procure the idol statue. He will wait for the signal from President Antivon to put the statue in place in the Temple.
The restrictive socialistic economic policies of the Western Alliance have resulted in shortages of food throughout the Alliance countries. Shortages are especially severe in Western Europe. Food riots are a near daily occurrence. Worker strikes are increasing as wages have stagnated. Commerce is grinding down and many types of goods and services are not available. The workers complain that those who do not work are given more than those who do the work.
Economic incentives to work and produce have been replaced by a system of coercion and punishments. There is open rebellion in the streets across the Western Alliance countries.
But President Antivon remains firm in his intention to create a socialist society based on saving the planet from Capitalists. And wealth is taken from the new Christians who are being martyred in large numbers, which his followers support. His followers become the beneficiaries as Christians are forced to "convert or die."
Bible predictions of Seal 5 become a reality. Christianity is outlawed due to the Bible's prohibition of idolatry, negative passages about homosexuality, and predictions about the future times. The Bible is banned as a "hate book" and ownership of one, or participating in Bible teachings, become a capital offense. Martyrdom of believers intensifies throughout the Western Alliance, which now consists of most of the world except for the Russian Alliance, Chinese Alliance, and Middle East Alliance which have been formed in opposition to the West. Many former enemies have signed alliance agreements in an attempt to counter the massive power of the Western Alliance. The world appears inevitably headed for the largest and most destructive world war ever seen by mankind.
CHAPTER 12
THE NEW JUSTICE AND THE MARK OF THE BEAST

President Antivon institutes a "Citizen Police Corps" made up of thugs who take it upon themselves to bring retribution against those they find to be "enemies of the People." This body of so-called "volunteers" loosely vetted by the State is outside the normal policing processes, and uses a system of intimidation and citizen's arrests, meaning they use force against those they disagree with. They also implement a trial by social media process as ordained by President Antivon. This new process is imposed on the entire Western Alliance and its treaty holders. An "Online Judge & Jury" by social media is conducted when a person is accused. Online voting for conviction or acquittal is established. Having Christian beliefs is a primary cause for accusation, and always ends in conviction unless the accused person renounces those beliefs. Anyone can bring an accusation to this public court, and turning in those who violate the dictates put in place under the State of Emergency is viewed as an act of patriotism. The Citizen Police Corps volunteers conduct a vote on each case of an accused person, and those found guilty are condemned by this jury of their online peers. Volunteers round up those convicted in this online system. Counter arguments are not allowed.
Accusations and judgments are reviewed and voted on in an online "peer" fashion, so everyone in the Western Alliance can watch the vote counter spinning, and those deemed to not embrace "progressive values" including environmentalism as a religion, the earth as sacred, elimination of Christianity worldwide, and President Antivon as a god are subject to being brought to trial online. The online juries are ruthless in accusing and condemning those who do not follow the dictates of the Antivon regime. For the condemned, guillotine capital punishment is activated as on option for the most grievous crimes against the State. Christian beliefs are treated as such serious crimes. Those found guilty are eliminated during mass executions, which can be watched online. The guillotines are kept working day and night to keep up with the demand. The website is a huge success and is played in public buildings, airports, and on giant screens in stadiums throughout the Western Alliance. This gory sport becomes the new "bread and circus" of the Western Alliance which has become known as "The Revived Roman Empire."
President Antivon puts into place more and more controls over the people. He fully institutes his new program to control behavior by limiting access to buying and selling unless the person is in compliance with a long list of The Dear Leader's pronouncements. The term "The Dear Leader" is gaining in popularity, especially among those who see him as some sort of god. Christians are especially targeted, and they call this program of economic exclusion "the Mark of the Beast" throughout the Western Alliance. No one can buy or sell unless they accept "The Mark" imposed by President Antivon, who Christians refer to as the Beast, or the Antichrist, or as the Antichrist.  Christians oppose The Mark vigorously, and many pay for that opposition with their lives. But it has a severe impact, since it splits families apart as they argue for and against taking The Mark in order to survive and feed the family. It is a cruel and vicious program designed to tear the Christian community apart. And it does.
In an online chat room citizens are seen using social media to criticize President Antivon. Their accounts are monitored by the newly formed and highly secretive Citizen Police Corps. Within days these chat room protesters are arrested for their crimes against the State. Their trials are swift and harsh. There is no room for protesting the dictates of the Dear Leader as he is being called by his ardent followers.
At a store in Paris people are standing in long lines buying food where the Mark of the Beast system has been implemented. Food is becoming very scarce, and long lines of people are shown. People using the Mark as their credentials are able to pass through quickly and easily as they scan their Mark App on their phones.  Those who attempt to buy without the Mark App are arrested and taken away by the police. Without the Mark App people are being forced into deprivation and starvation. Things are getting desperate. Starvation is a very persuasive means of coercing compliance.
But some try to resist.  Challenges to the unending Martial Law, State of Emergency, and Mark system reach the Western Alliance Supreme Court. These three are considered by many to be unconstitutional, and likely to be struck down by the Court. Just hours before the vote, a conservative Justice is found dead of suspicious circumstances. After a delay of several days, the Supreme Court challenge is stymied by a four-four vote, therefore the extreme measures continue unabated.
In rural North Carolina, Christians are meeting in secret to discuss the Mark program. The Christian community is divided about the issue since it can mean economic survival for a family. The decisions are difficult. Being a Christian in these times has become a matter of making life or death commitments.
Group Leader Stevens: "Fellow Christians, we have only been believers a short time. The Rapture opened our eyes. But we face stiff opposition, and are persecuted to the point of death. We are being told to accept the Mark of the Beast or we will be cut off from all economic activity. But we must obey the Bible and refuse The Mark. This is a firm stance which we must take. It is meant to test our faith and show the lost and dying world that we believe in Christ as our Savior, and trust in God for our security and well-being."
A fellow new believer speaks up:  "That sounds easy, but is it better to starve my family and see them die from need rather than take The Mark on myself? I have a wife and four young children. How can we be forced to do this? I will lose my job if I do not accept The Mark. It is simply too much to ask. I cannot sit by and watch my family starve for my beliefs.  I feel I must comply and take the consequences. Isn't that the Christian thing to do, to support and protect my family?"
Group Leader Stevens: "It is hard, there is no doubt. No one minimizes the suffering.  But that is the point of it. We must remain strong in the faith. If we take The Mark the Bible says we will die in disgrace and suffer loss of eternal rewards. If we refuse The Mark most of us will live, although some will certainly be martyrs for our faith. It is what God requires of us in this highly unusual time of extreme suffering. We cannot question Him. Taking The Mark is denying the faith. It is that simple. Consider the words of our Lord Jesus when He said:
"Matthew 24:4 “Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7  Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8  All these are the beginning of birth pains. 9 “Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12  Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.”
Group Leader Stevens continues: "When Jesus said “you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death” and “many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other” and “the love of most will grow cold” it shows how desperate these times will be for believers. The Lord knew this. He was talking about us. You and me, right here, right now.
During the Tribulation many believers will lose faith and question why God would allow such evil to exist.  Family members will be divided as their love grows cold, and they will betray each other to the evil authorities.  It will be a time when the faith of believers will be stretched to the breaking point, but there is a reason for it.  We believers must realize we have been specially chosen to convey the message of salvation in this way to a truly wicked generation of hardened unbelievers, and only strong faith and even martyrdom can break through and bring some of those lost souls to salvation.  We must also understand we will either be taken care of and preserved to go into the Millennium for 1000 years of perfect environment on this same earth, or else we will become martyrs and have special blessings as resurrected believers who become priests for the Lord during the Millennium.  Only by focusing on these goals will we  be able to maintain our faith and persevere to the end of the Tribulation or serve the Lord as a martyr, whichever the Lord chooses as our destiny.  Jesus said about us “but the one who stands firm to the end will be delivered”, meaning delivered into the Millennial Kingdom alive to live 1000 years in perfect environment under the rule of Jesus Christ.  But for those who  die as martyrs, there is comfort and extra eternal rewards:
Revelation 7:16 “‘Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst.  The sun will not beat down on them, nor any scorching heat.  17  For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; ‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’  ‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’ ”
Group Leader Stevens: "The Tribulation martyrs will die from both deprivation and execution because of their faith, but the Lord makes up for all of it, and they will suffer no more once they are in heaven and beyond the reach of any further trouble which is coming to the earth. In the midst of the horror of their death the reassurance of eternal happiness is given. But for those who sent them to heaven, the greatest of judgments awaits. God may be slow to anger, but at some point He judges. The blood of the martyrs will be avenged."
Discussions among the new Christians show the difficulty of resisting the Mark of the Beast. The insidious nature of The Mark is that it divides Christians and causes many to renounce their new faith and take The Mark because they assume it will protect their families from starvation. But it is a false dilemma. Those who take The Mark suffer from the judgments while those who do not are spared from those same judgments. But even so, the suffering for believers is intense, but it is not a judgment from God, but rather it is a test of the faith.
Group Leader Stevens reads from the book they have been reading, called "The Future Times:"
"Refusing the Mark of the Beast will result in martyrdom for some believers, but most will be spared by God from the effects of the decision.  The second half of the Tribulation will be a very difficult time for all believers.  All will face deprivation, and some will die a martyr's death.  Families will be torn apart as they argue among themselves that taking The Mark is required for the survival of themselves and their children.  Those who try to remain strong and refuse The Mark will be under intense pressure to give in to evil for the sake of their families.  Matthew 24:12-13 says: “Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved [delivered into the Millennium].”  Those who take The Mark will die anyway.  But those who refuse will be a testimony for Jesus Christ to a hardened world, and they also may be delivered into a perfect environment for 1000 years.  Taking The Mark will be certain death and no rewards for eternity.  Refusing The Mark will mean the opportunity to save unbelievers and also possibly (but no guarantees) to go into the Millennium and have 1000 years of pleasure after this relatively short time of intense misery.  Either way those who remain faithful will have eternal rewards.  It will still be a hard choice for many believers.  Maintaining love will be difficult but indispensable to survival and for fulfilling God’s special plan for their lives.  As a side note, it would be wise to avoid having children during the Tribulation since that will greatly complicate the suffering for those involved."
It is now 2 years after the Rapture.
Back in LA, Jill Steiner notes the two year anniversary of the Vanishment during her LANX morning news show. She begins her broadcast with no feeling in her voice:
"Two years ago today we witnessed the Vanishment of over 100 million of our fellow citizens. There were no burials.  There were no headstones.  Just empty clothes on the ground where they last stood, or in seats where they sat, or at accident scenes.  As it turns out, they were the lucky ones.  Now for today's news."
Jill goes on to announce new tragedies and disasters which had occurred overnight.  As she does, she thinks to herself how odd it is that she has no feelings about those who perished, just numbness.  The deaths of another several hundred thousand people in the past 24 hours no longer fazes her, since she has become immune to caring about all the lives lost.  So also have her listeners.  To Jill it is a loss of humanity.
In a small suburban house in west LA a couple sits watching the morning news. Jim Toss says to his wife "Sue, I have come to believe that there is a purpose in all of this. A God who wants to get our attention. I am trying to figure that out. I think the Christians have the right idea. They speak of love, when the rest of the world is lost in their own numb feelings of hate and helplessness. The Christians speak of forgiveness and redemption when the rest of the world talks of how to get ahead at someone else's expense. Can simply surviving be all there is in life, or is there a Savior who can do for us spiritually what we cannot do for ourselves. What do you think?"
Before Sue can reply, their daughter in the other room yells in: "If you keep talking like that I will turn both of you in to the Authorities. That is what I think." Jim's wife ignores both of them and stares at the floor.
Jim goes back to looking at the news story and does not mention it again. But he thinks to himself how many lives have been torn apart, how many people have been refused the option to talk about what they really believe, and how cold-hearted most people have become.
Children have been turned against their own parents and are encouraged to report them for violations against the State. A tear falls slowly down Jim's face as he feels a sense of helplessness and hopelessness engulfing him.
CHAPTER 13
NATURAL DISASTERS INTENSIFY

In the air above the island of Diego Garcia 1000 miles south of India, a Western Alliance military aircraft is patrolling the area watching for pirates.  Pirating has become a booming industry in these hard times, and is cutting into the profits of the Alliance.  Slaves taken in regional wars are being shipped out of Africa, India and Southeast Asia, and are desperately needed to meet the needs of the ruling class members in Europe, especially in Rome which  has become the city of choice for the elite of the West.  The co-pilot looks up from eating his lunch and sees a single large wave several hundred feet high heading straight for their home base of Diego Garcia.  The island is only 12 square miles in area, and this wave would wipe it off the map.  In fact, there are about 60 small islands in this area.  The pilot grabs the radio microphone and relays an emergency warning.  But it is a useless warning.  The crew watches helplessly as the island chain is wiped away by the wave, which is estimated to be over 300 feet high.  The crew was just finishing their four hour hovering tour as the wave hit.  The pilot looks at his fuel gauge and thinks "We do not have enough fuel to reach any land mass."  He thinks of his wife and children as he relays orders to his crew to prepare for a water landing, probably 750 miles from India.  The crew knew what that meant.  There would be no ships left in this part of the Indian Ocean which could rescue them.
At the same time in the city of Colombo, Sri Lanka, an island nation off the southern tip of India, the tidal wave hit while people were going out for lunch. A tidal wave warning had been issued but most ignored it since there had been so many false alarms during the previous several months. The 300 foot wave hit the city with such force that even tall buildings were pushed inland over a mile. Needless to say, all 800,000 residents of the city died, along with many more along the nation's western coast, and also along the southern tip of India. Within the next few hours the giant wave wiped out numerous other Indian Ocean islands, and also hit the east coast of Africa, especially Somalia, very hard.
LANX News Anchor Jill Steiner covers the disasters, which is a routine part of her news show:
"This is the rundown of disasters during the past 24 hours..."  She reads her report as if it was the daily sports news, then she adds "...at least the ones we know about."  She takes a deep breath before starting through the list.
"Reports have just come in of a giant tsunami striking the southern tip of India, the nearby island of Sri Lanka, and a multitude of other islands in the Indian Ocean. It started approximately 500 miles southwest of India. Reports from an air crew stated it was over 300 feet high, which would make it the largest ever seen. The tsunami also wiped out the island of Diego Garcia and numerous other islands in the Indian Ocean, including the Maldives, Seychelles, Mauritius, and others. It is estimated 4 million people may have died."
"In other news a previously unknown skin-eating bacterial infection which eats the entire skin off within 48 hours is sweeping across Australia, and so far has killed over 45,000 people in just one week."
"Moving on from that, a war between India and Pakistan intensified as nuclear weapons were used on cities of both nations.  Preliminary reports indicate mass casualties..."  Jill stops mid- sentence and says "What does "mass casualties" mean when we are reporting millions of people killed by natural disasters?  Did these nuclear weapons kill only 10,000?  We just do not know.  Anyway, communications in the area have been disrupted by the electromagnetic interference of the nuclear blasts.  So I guess there could be many more dead 	who knows?"
Jill struggles to remain focused on just reading the reports.
Jill continues: "An earthquake caused a breach in the 300 foot tall Nurek Dam in Tajikistan, the second tallest dam in the world.  The resulting release of water is believed to have killed 10,000 people downstream."
"Intense lightning burned an entire city to the ground in central Uganda.  No one survived, and the death toll is estimated to be 25,000."
"A sinkhole opened under the city of Mount Gambier in southern Australia, swallowing the entire city. Over 30,000 people disappeared and were buried in just seconds."
Trying to lighten the mood Jill adds "In sports, the Little League World Series was held in Williamsport, Pennsylvania yesterday. The game had been postponed by a day due to baseball-sized hail." OK, so that did not lighten anyone's mood, she thinks to herself. "Don't you wish for the days when we could discuss a baseball game and not think about a disaster? Anyway, back to the disastrous events of the week" Jill says as her face turns to stone once again.
"In the Netherlands a breach in the Afsluitdijk Dike led to a secondary breach of the Houtribdijk Dike, flooding all cities along the Markermeer Sea, including Amsterdam where the canals were flooded and many were trapped in their homes and drowned."
"There were numerous earthquakes along the Ring of Fire Pacific fault line. Intense damage was caused all along the fault line as entire cities were swallowed whole or burned to the ground by falling molten rock, resulting in heavy casualties."
"In the Pacific Solomon Islands, thousands of local monkeys became enraged and attacked island residents, tearing them to pieces. Scores of people were killed..."
Jill pauses and says "That's all I can handle. Suffice to say a lot of bad stuff continues to happen day after day after day. There are far more than I can report. I could go on but there just does not seem to be any point in it." Jill pulls out her earpiece and leaves the anchor desk as the news crew tries to figure out what to do next. They put up live video from Amsterdam showing dead bodies floating in the flood waters.
Around the world the persecution of Christians intensifies.  Many of the group of 144,000 have been martyred during the past two years.  Their leader Shem Kolb continues to coordinate the efforts of evangelization.  But due to treaty obligations with the Western Alliance the authorities in Israel have declared the group to be "enemies of the State."  The believers meet in secret and by social media connection, but the authorities have planted computer viruses in the social media platforms.  There is a bounty placed on members of the group, and those who arrest any group members are rewarded with extra Marks in their account.  Midnight raids of believer's homes are a regular occurrence.  Tonight it is Shem who hears the breaking down of his door as the Citizen's Police storms into his home. He is taken away into the night as his wife and children scream in terror. Shem is not heard from again.
CHAPTER 14
WORLD-WIDE WAR EXPANDS

It has been over three years since the Vanishment and the installation of Antivon as the US President. President Antivon as head of the Western Alliance is determined to conquer even more nations, even though the list already includes 73 nations and territories of all sizes. He arrogantly adopts the credo and coat of arms of the legendary novel hero James Bond, who used the motto "Orbis Non Sufficit", meaning "The World Is Not Enough." The world must be his, and his alone, he reasoned. There is no room for other lesser beings. After all, he is a god. He calls his military chiefs into counsel to plan his next move.
As the military chiefs arrive for the meeting, two of them walk behind the others and ask each other whether it is honorable to support this world conquest goal. What is the point, when no other alliance can now match the Western Alliance military might? These two did not realize there was a new technology installed to listen to all discussions within the White House grounds. Several armed men appear and quickly take the two Generals out of the building.
They are replaced later that same day.
President Antivon takes charge of the meeting and demands that more countries must be brought into the Western Alliance before the other alliances of the north, south and east can move on those same countries. He has a plan which he lays out to the Generals who are assembled. It involves the Middle East and North Africa. Yes, there is a treaty with Israel, but that is no matter.  That treaty is a temporary distraction and will be invalidated at a convenient time. He sends out his Generals with instructions to devise a plan to attack the Middle East through Israel and then proceed into North Africa. The Generals, although surprised, depart to do as he has demanded. They know that if they do not do as he has asked, others will replace them and do the job. It is a difficult time for moral decision making.
The Generals return later that week with a military plan to invade the Middle East. Israel will be the intermediate target, and will become a base for further conquest into North Africa. The plan is accepted and President Antivon tells them to wait for his orders to proceed. President Antivon tells them he will talk with the Israeli Prime Minister to clear the way for a "low impact invasion" of Israel.
President Antivon calls Israeli Prime Minister Garlock: "Be prepared to set up my statue in the Temple on the Temple Mount. I am nearly ready for the next phase." Prime Minister Garlock replies "We are ready to go whenever you give the order."
In the meantime several of the General Staff meet secretly to discuss their options. None of them trust each other. There have been too many secret police arrests of high officials, including generals. But they each agree that something must be done to stop the madness before it goes any further. They agree to watch for an opportunity to take action to implement a change in government "when and if it becomes a feasible option." As they depart they each have no specific plan, and no real hope that they can be effective in stopping President Antivon from becoming a dictator in all respects.
During the preceding three years the people have been primed to accept the new religion of President Antivon, and now most are ready to embrace it with great enthusiasm. The prospect of a secular god with no moral requirements on them who will also heal the earth by his environmental measures and eliminate those hated moralistic Christians has wide appeal. A religion without moral requirements is enticing. Social media is used to spread this evangelism presenting President Antivon as a god. His status as someone who can cheat death, heal the earth, and give his followers the riches they desire takes on mystical levels. At the same time President Antivon has steadily become a more imposing and physically powerful figure with super-human powers of persuasion and mental abilities rarely seen. He can suddenly speak any language, perform great feats of strength, give amazing oratory, and mesmerizes all audiences which hear him. Prime Minister Garlock said of his newly found powers "He has become possessed of powers never before seen by mere mortals. He is indeed a god among us." Loyal followers agree.
The Western Alliance sets out to conquer even more helpless nations. Most fall easily, some resist and the results are brutal for those countries and their citizens. The least of the nations are not spared, and none are too small or insignificant to be brought under this umbrella of tyranny.
On the island country of Nauru, the smallest island country in the world, a group of men are fishing among the coral reefs which ring the island.  To their surprise a small watercraft carrying just twenty armed soldiers from the Western Alliance arrive.  Bewildered, they tell the soldiers to go somewhere else and stop disturbing the fish, at which point they are shot. The soldiers go onto the main island continuing to shoot every citizen.  Within a few hours all of the 2000 citizens of the island are dead or captured.  The country has no military significance except that it can be counted as one more nation ruled by the egomaniac Antivon. To him, ruling useless bits of terrain is a matter of feeding his intense power lust.  One by one, nation by nation, the Western Alliance expands its global coverage.
But the other three major world alliances are not prepared to simply allow this expansion to continue. Bloody battles are raging around the globe as Western Alliance forces seek to expand their footprint. At this point, the Northern Alliance, badly bruised by their failed Middle East invasion just three years earlier, has regained enough of its strength to resist the Western Alliance in key areas. A series of naval engagements in the Mediterranean Sea and Baltic Sea take a toll on the Western Alliance. Several of the West's large warships have been sunk, including a carrier. The Northern Alliance also thwarts the advances of the Western Alliance into southern Asia and the southern part of Russia, which enrages Antivon. He vows revenge.
The death toll from the continual world-wide war is staggering, and rising rapidly.  Over 100,000,000 have been killed on all sides.  It has been the bloodiest world war in history, and it is not over yet.  No side has any interest in stopping the war.  In some ways, the Alliance leaders see the wars as the only way to keep their economies going.  But the cost is enormous, both humanly and financially.
As a result of the wars plus the numerous and continual natural disasters there is a world- wide economic depression. Food shortages are the primary concern for most people. The life of the average person has become one of simply trying to survive. Most of their lives have been reduced to a subsistence level, and many face starvation. The world has gone from just the standard human issues several years ago to daily disasters, chaos, famine, unrest, social upheaval, unfettered crime, and a total breakdown of societal standards in a very short time. But as bad as things are now, the real suffering is about to begin, and will intensify by several orders of magnitude. It is time to enter the second half of the Tribulation.
CHAPTER 15
THE MIDPOINT

It is nearly three and a half years since the Vanishment. After work Jill Steiner is back at her apartment and calls her Mom:
"Mom, I have learned that the Midpoint of the Tribulation will be the full reveal of the Antichrist. Until this point he has pretended to be interested in solving the problems of the world, but instead he has engaged in continuous war just to gain power.  The Antichrist started by consolidating ten nations into his Revived Roman Empire, and then took over many more nations. Now that he is the most powerful leader on earth, Satan will use him to try to consolidate all the nations of the earth under a one-world system where Satan will be the real leader. Satan will exert maximum influence over this evil leader and use him to set up a satanic worldwide religious system, and the False Prophet will assist in the task of establishing the Antichrist as a false god. Then they will impose this satanic religious system on the entire world."
Mom: "You have it right, dear.  In my Bible study group we have been studying the dragon and the Antichrist.  This is the point when the Antichrist becomes "fully one" with the dragon Satan, as Revelation 13 says:"
Revelation 13:1 “The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.”
"Our study group has been reading the book "The Future Times" and it says about this Midpoint time period:
"Having been thrown out of Heaven, the dragon Satan is now confined to earth and is desperate since he is running out of time and knows it. Satan is seen standing “on the shore of the sea”. The “sea” refers to the gentile nations as opposed to “the land” which is Israel. The sea is in turmoil due to the Rapture having occurred. Satan chooses a man called here “a beast coming out of the sea” from among the gentile nations who will be his proxy and do his will.  Satan empowers his human counterpart to seize a massive amount of power, and his ultimate goal is to eliminate the Jews.  This man is often called just “the Antichrist”, but because of the way John presents him we will call this man the Antichrist, who is a gentile, from a Western nation since he will take over as King of the West.  Daniel’s prophesies about him is that he “came up among them”, meaning among the western nations (Daniel 7:8).  Satan will empower him personally through demon possession and Satan will also personally possess him at times, something extremely rare.  This man will be set up by Satan as an idol to be worshiped in the new religion of the Tribulation, a secular religion which worships a man instead of God or a presumed god.  While a religion is generally the worship of a deity, during the Tribulation this worldwide religion will be the worship of a man empowered by Satan, and therefore the worship of Satan himself.  This godless religion will be focused on the things which mankind in unbelief seek to do apart from God, and would likely include humanism, internationalism, environmentalism, and socialism, all attempting to solve the world’s problems apart from the true God of the universe.  This satanic religion will be a combination of false humanistic ideology and a degeneration into the depths of hatred and wanton barbarity.  Satan will empower and use this man along with a godless religion to seek to implement a fake millennium of his own, thinking he can somehow thwart God’s plan for a Millennial reign of Jesus Christ.  Satan has read the book of Revelation, but he wants to re-write the ending.  He chooses a man and gives him great power – the power he offered to Jesus Christ during the three temptations, but Jesus refused to accept it from him. (Matthew 4:1-11)  But during the Tribulation Satan will find his true soul mate, and this man will embrace the satanic plan and readily accept the power Satan offers.  The world will suffer immeasurably as a result."
Jill adds: "I have been reading what the Apostle Paul said:"
2  Thessalonians 2:3 “Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day [Second Advent] will not come until the rebellion [Tribulation] occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction [Antichrist]. 4 He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple [Abomination of Desolation], proclaiming himself to be God. 5 Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things? 6 And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. 7 For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back [Holy Spirit] will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. 8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming [Second Advent]. 9 The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie, 10 and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. 11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie.”
Jill continues: "I have also read that together the two Beasts set up their worldwide false religion based on worshiping the Antichrist, which in reality is worshiping Satan.  The False Prophet will also be demon possessed and will perform amazing acts of false miracles using satanic power.  Matthew 24:24 refers to the Antichrist and False Prophet working together: “For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.”
"The world is falling into the trap and accepting the lies of this false religion instead of accepting the grace of God through Jesus Christ the true Savior. This is why the judgments during the Tribulation will be so intensely destructive and deadly. God is gracious for a time, but He will not be mocked by this false religion for long."
Jill's Mom interjects:  "Jill, you have come so far.  I am proud of you.  The leader in Israel is just a puppet of the Antichrist, and has become the False Prophet for a new secular religion based on making the Antichrist a human god with statues of himself which are idols to be worshiped.  It is all so sickening.  Revelation 13:15 says: “The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. 16 It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads.”
Jill: "I need to get an expert on my show tomorrow to interview about this issue. Watch my show. Bye Mom."
Mom: "I always watch your show. Along with a billion other people, you know. Bye."
Jill wondered what her Mom meant by "a billion people." Jill thought she had a couple million viewers.
The next day Jill is at her LANX news studio and has invited Professor Heathrow, Professor of Biblical Ancient Civilization Studies at the University of Southern California, to explain what the Bible says is about to happen at the Midpoint of the Tribulation.
Jill: Professor Heathrow, we are very near the Midpoint of the Tribulation. What can we expect to happen next?"
Professor Heathrow:  "First, let us define the Midpoint.  The Bible tells us that the Tribulation consists of two equal parts, each exactly 1260 days long.  In the Bible, years do not match our current 365 day years, since the ancients measured years by the moon, not by the sun, so years in the Bible are 360 days long, not 365 days.  So 3 1/2 years is 360 x 3.5 which is 1260 days.  But days are days.  The so-called "Vanishment" occurred 1255 days ago.  That means we are 5 days from the exact Midpoint of the Tribulation.  And it is a big event in the unfolding of the eschatology of the Tribulation."
Jill: "Professor, I appreciate that you are so intellectual, but what does it mean to most of my viewers?"
Professor Heathrow: "Quite right, of course. Well, it means things are about to get much, much worse. At the Midpoint the False Prophet leader of Israel will put the statue of the Antichrist, called the Abomination of Desolation idol, in the temple in Jerusalem. Then it will appear to speak. This use of ventriloquist demons will fool many as demon voices will come from the idol statue itself. The deification of the Antichrist by the False Prophet will continue to build, and the entire world will become ensnared by this false religion. True believers who refuse to worship the idol statue of the Antichrist will be persecuted, and many will be killed for holding firm to their faith. Strong economic incentives will be used as the False Prophet forces people everywhere to take the Mark of the Beast, and no one will be allowed to buy or sell anything without The Mark. So the incentive to comply and accept this religion will be very powerful. Even some believers will take The Mark, and the temptation will be very strong since the survival of the person’s family appears to be at stake, but those believers who accept it will suffer and even die for doing so. Believers must understand that their martyrdom is required to evangelize a hardened world, and also that they will be greatly rewarded for their martyrdom. This false religion is used by Satan to attempt to kill off believers, and many will become martyrs, but it will be because of God’s Plan to use them to evangelize the world, not because Satan desires it. This is why believers who are in Israel at the time the idol statue is erected in the temple must flee to the mountains and remain there under divine protection until the Tribulation is over, since they will be the bulk of the Jewish believers who live to go into the Millennium."
Professor Heathrow continues:  "The idol is a sign to the believers in Israel to flee to the safety of the mountains east of the Jordan River.  Matthew 24 foretold of the idol statue of the Antichrist during the Tribulation and the requirement for all believers in Israel to flee and not come out of hiding until Jesus returns and the Tribulation is over:
Matthew 24:15 “So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’ spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand— 16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.”
"Then Jesus went on to discuss the Tribulation as the worst period of human history:
Matthew 24:21: “For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.”
"And then Jesus talked about the False Prophet:
Matthew 24:24: “For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have told you ahead of time.”
Professor Heathrow continues: "When the idol statue of the Antichrist is set up in the temple in Jerusalem all believers in Israel must flee immediately without any delay to the high desert area of current day Jordan. If they do not flee quickly, they will be killed. These Jewish believers will form the core group of those who will repopulate the earth during the 1000 year Millennial reign of Christ."
"In the meantime, the False Prophet has already devised a scheme for forcing all people everywhere to worship the Antichrist, and he is using economic incentives for this purpose."
Revelation 13:17 “so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name. 18 This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.  That number is 666.”
Jill: "Professor, the number 666 has become legendary as a satanic symbol. What does it mean?"
Professor Heathrow: "The Mark of the Antichrist is said to be 666, which is “the name of the beast” or “the number of its name”.  The reason for the 666 is not clear yet, but it will become clear very soon to those who have true wisdom.  This will be part of the economic arm- twisting by the Antichrist, and will be so powerful that only the truly faithful believers will be able to resist, and that at the peril of their own death, and also the death of their family members.  We see God's warning to believers in Revelation 14:9-10: “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand, they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury.”  There will be many believers who are martyred during the Tribulation for refusal to take the Mark of the Beast.  There will also be believers who die in disgrace because they take the Mark of the Beast in spite of having been warned not to do so. Therefore, taking the Mark may spare the believer from death from the Beast's henchmen, but it will not spare the believer from death during God's judgments which are meant to target unbelievers, but will also target those who take The Mark.  That is the significance of 666."
Jill: "Then what comes next, after the Abomination of Desolation idol?"
Professor Heathrow: "The last half of the Tribulation will be a time of a total breakdown of society. People who are not believers will engage in a detachment from reality like never seen before. Freedom will be lost in exchange for the power and false sense of security from the State. There will be a worldwide false religion accepted en masse by people refusing to believe in Jesus Christ as Savior. Worshiping the true God will be a crime punishable by death. Good will be called evil and evil will be called good by the degenerate masses. The innocent will be judged as guilty by the State while criminals are declared to be heroes. Crime will be rampant as people prey on each other. Political power will replace individual liberty as all dissent will be repressed. Police agencies will be used to enforce political dictates as only those who take the Mark of the Beast can engage in economic activity, or buy or sell at all. Failure to have the Mark will be a crime. The Bible will be declared a hate book, and all who believe that it is God’s Word will be pursued as the enemy of the State.  All that is Truth will be called false, and the lie from Satan will be deemed to be the truth. The world will be turned upside down. That is because Satan at his core is a liar who promotes only lies, and hates the Truth. And his main man on earth, the Antichrist, will be the same as his benefactor Satan, a liar from beginning to end, as the Apostle John said:
John 8:44 “You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.”
Professor Heathrow continues: "But even in the face of all this evil, God does not give up offering salvation to the degenerate people of the earth. He will go to extreme lengths trying to get these people to change their minds and accept Christ as Savior."
Jill:  "Thank you for that valuable insight, Professor."  Jill turns toward the other camera: "And now for the rundown on the daily disasters which occurred during the past 24 hours..."
Later that evening, Jill Steiner is at home reading the book "The Future Times." She thinks to herself, "Well this writer has been right so far, I wonder what is coming during the next last half of the Tribulation, which is about to begin. Here we go. Revelation Chapter 7."
"God provides every chance for salvation for those who are willing to listen.	then the most severe divine judgments begin during the last 3 ½ years of the Tribulation."
Revelation 7:1 “After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree.”
Jill thinks to herself: "I wonder what my Weatherman at the station will do when he sees this happen? No wind anywhere on the earth? Doesn't that also mean no rain?"
Jill continues to read: "As we saw previously, the first six Seals reveal disasters which include intense weather conditions on the earth. Scorching sun, wind, hail, tornadoes, hurricanes, lack of rain, too much rain, and so on will cause tremendous hardships. Both personal and economic disaster will be the norm during the Tribulation. God uses His elect angels to control the weather patterns of the earth, and these angels will be especially active during the Tribulation. There are four weather angels stationed in the north, south, east, and west portions of the globe, and during the Tribulation they will be given authority to cause great destruction on the earth."
Jill thinks to herself: It has been nearly 3 1/2 years since the Vanishment occurred.  The Professor said we are only 5 days from the Midpoint.  So the Bible says it is about to get far worse.  Fantastic.  Those who went up in the Rapture were the fortunate ones.  She considers what she should have done differently with her life.  Everyone just wanted to have a nice social life and make some money and get ahead.  She realizes now that was all so shallow.  If only  she had become a believer early in life.  But enough what-ifs, I am here for a purpose now.
She continues to read about the part Satan and his demons are playing in all of this:
"At the same time Jewish believers are fleeing Israel into the high desert country, Satan and all fallen angels are thrown out of Heaven. Upon seeing those Jewish believers fleeing, Satan and his demons attack them, trying to stop them from getting to their place of divine protection in the mountains east of Israel. This attack is described here as “the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent.” But the Jewish believers will be protected as the passage says “The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness.”
The time available for leaving will be short, and their escape will require supernatural divine protection referred to as the “wings of an eagle” to protect them on their trip out of Israel, as this phrase is regularly used for divine protection: Exodus 19:4 “You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself.” Deuteronomy 32: 9-11 - “like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them aloft.”
"Satan will try to prevent the Jewish believers from escaping Israel by “spewing water like a river” which refers to the demons thrown out of Heaven along with Satan pursuing the fleeing Jews like a torrent, and possibly also flooding the Jordan River valley which the Jews will be crossing, but that attack will fail as God counters it and protects the fleeing Jews.  But any who delay their departure will be killed. Once the Jews cross into the country of Jordan, in a region generally east and southeast of the Dead Sea, they will be protected by God with supernatural hiding, angelic protection, and provisions during the remaining 3 ½ years of the Tribulation. Once again Satan will be frustrated in his attempts to gain some advantage. Now that these Jewish believers have escaped and are under a supernatural dome of divine protection, Satan's attempts to kill all Jews will have failed, so this part of his evil plan will have been foiled."
Revelation 12:13 “When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. 14 The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach. 15 Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. 16 But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.”
Back in Jerusalem, Josh Simmons, the new leader of the 144,000 evangelists, has maintained the library accumulated by Shem Kolb, the previous leader who disappeared over a year ago. Josh thinks to himself how he wished Shem was still in charge.  He was such a great leader, and always knew what to do.  Josh is not so sure of himself.  But he is talking with those who remain of his fellow 144,000 evangelists, and he reminds them of what is coming now that the Midpoint of the Tribulation is near.  They will need to be prepared to act, and act quickly.  He reminds the others who are gathered together what is about to happen, and what they must do in response to it.
Josh starts out: "Several events will soon happen simultaneously at the exact Midpoint of the Tribulation.  The first event is the installation of an idol statue of the Antichrist, called the Abomination of Desolation, in the Jewish temple here in Jerusalem.  This triggers the second simultaneous event, since the idol statue is a sign for all Jewish believers in Israel to flee to the mountains where God has provided a place of divine refuge and protection.  This creates a crisis on earth for Jewish believers, and timing is crucial.  We must obey instantly or we will  be killed by the forces of the Antichrist.  We must follow instructions precisely, as Matthew 24 says:
Matthew 24:15 “So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’ spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand— 16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17  Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house. 18 Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. 19 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! 20  Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.”
Josh: "Watch and wait. The time is near. Be prepared to depart the instant you hear the news." Those who are gathered depart for their homes to prepare.
A few days later, on orders from President Antivon his statue is put inside the Temple in Jerusalem. When anyone approaches it, the statue appears to speak, and people are amazed by it. Rumors spread of this "miracle" and many come from far away to the Temple to worship the idol of President Antivon. The Prime Minister of Israel as the Prophet for the Antichrist spreads the word of the religion which focuses on worshiping both the idol and President Antivon. President Antivon and Prime Minister Garlock solidify the image of President Antivon as a god. The pilgrimage to the Temple to worship the statue of the Antichrist becomes an annual ritual for many faithful followers.
In Times Square New York a huge crowd has gathered at the news of the statue of President Antivon being put in the Temple in Jerusalem, and that it is speaking. A young man says to his friend "This man is a god! He cheated death, he has amassed enormous power, he is healing the earth from climate change, he has taken on those moralistic Christians and put them in their place, and now even his statue speaks. I was never religious or mystical, but this man has powers I have never seen. I say he is a god." Cheers go up among those listening.
His friend agrees "Right on all accounts, and I would add that the Harmonics of the Universe seem to be in alignment with him. There is something spiritual about how he senses the feelings of the Earth, and how he is connected with the entire cosmos miasma. He is certainly a spirit from another dimension. I believe!"
The Times Square crowd chants over and over: "Antivon is our god, Antivon is our god	"
Back at LANX News, Jill is in the studio reporting the daily disasters as news of the idol in the Temple reaches her.  She stops mid-sentence and says: "The Abomination of Desolation idol has just been put into the Temple in Jerusalem.  This is exactly what the Bible said would happen.  Today is 1261 days since the Vanishment, the day which was prophesied for this to happen.  All Jewish believers in Israel must immediately flee to the mountains east of the Jordan River."
In Israel, news of the idol statue being put into the Temple had already spread quickly. The signal for Jews to flee has been given. There are some Jewish believers who had not yet heard, but were watching Jill's internet news. They immediately get up, grab their packed bag, and run for their cars. The roads are clogged going east as believers flee to the mountains, headed for a place near Petra, Jordan and another location in far southern Jordan. As the believer Jews flee to the mountains, they are pursued by the Western Alliance forces, and also by an unusual occurrence in the skies.
As the Jewish believers are fleeing Israel and heading to the mountains of Jordan, a sudden fury overtakes them in the form of a thick swarm of unknown origin. One woman named Nena had to leave her car behind and is hurrying to keep up. She thinks she cannot make it across the Jordan River bridge. The swarm seems to be overtaking them. Nena says to one of her fellow travelers "I cannot make it, I am going to die here on this road." Just as she says those words a sudden sandstorm comes up from the East, and blows the swarm backward.
Others shout encouragement to Nena, the last in the line of escapees. "Come on Nena, you can make it!" shouts one man. It is her cousin from North Jerusalem. He drops back to help her. "Save yourself" she says, I will not survive." But her cousin will not let her fall behind. "I will carry you myself if that is required, but hurry, we must get across the Jordan." Just then the swarm returns with a vengeance to strike the fleeing believers who have fallen behind.
They are almost there...the river is just yards away. Suddenly the east wind blows the swarm back, allowing Nena and her fellow stragglers to reach the Jordan River, and cross to the other side.  The swarm turns and heads back toward the west to take their revenge on an unprepared Jerusalem which is now empty of believers, except for a few who did not heed the warnings.
As the last of the fleeing believers reach the Jordan mountains sanctuary, they are greeted by those who have been in place and set up the camps. "You are safe now" says the camp leader at Petra. "Nothing can harm you here." Nena and the others settle in and get their living quarters assignments. As they do, they think of the horror in store for those who did not flee Jerusalem.
The believers go into hiding as directed by the Bible.  They find provisions have been stored for them there by Christians who departed years ago, and by the 144,000 who brought the remnants of supplies left behind after the failed Russian invasion three years earlier.  The remaining few of the 144,000 who survived the purges of the first half of the Tribulation look down across the Jordan River valley and say a prayer for those who will become new believers and will need to stay in Israel and fight the forces of the Antichrist.  The 144,000 did their job evangelizing during the past several years, and now it is time for a new and very different form of evangelization.  Two witnesses will soon appear in Jerusalem and shock the world.
CHAPTER 16
THE TWO WITNESSES

Back in Jerusalem two figures appear on the Temple Mount who had not previously been seen in the city. No one remembered ever seeing or hearing them on the Temple Mount, but now they are loudly proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ the Messiah from outside the Temple.
Their names are Moses and Elijah, and they have been on the earth before, but departed 3000 and 2500 years ago respectively.  And they have come back with a message.  Prepare the way for the Lord, because He will return in 3 1/2 years.
Upon hearing of the two new witnesses in Jerusalem, Josh Simmons the leader of the 144,000 calls together those who had just fled Israel and pulls out the book "The Future Times" from which he reads aloud to those who are now gathered in the mountains near Petra, Jordan, not far from the border with Israel.
"Just as John the Baptist was the herald of the First Advent of Jesus Christ, these two witnesses will be the heralds of the Second Advent of Christ. All three have the same message – prepare the way for the Lord. This time the message is to prepare the way for the Second Advent of Jesus Christ which will be the culminating event of the Tribulation."
Revelation 11:3 “And I will appoint my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth. 4  They are “the two olive trees” and the two lampstands, and “they stand before the Lord of the earth. 5 If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die. 6 They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.””
Josh continues reading:
"The two witnesses will preach for 3 ½ years (3 ½ years = 42 months = 1260 days), so they will arrive at the exact Midpoint of the Tribulation.  God never gives up on grace, and evangelism will continue despite the evil in the world.  The Jewish believers of the first half of the Tribulation will have recently fled to the mountains for divine protection and to wait for the Second Advent, as instructed by Matthew 24.  This is because they must be reserved as a remnant of believers who will populate the Millennial Kingdom, so their sole job is to survive the remainder of the Tribulation.
The two witnesses arrive in Israel where no evangelists remain, and they will preach the gospel from the temple and convert many Jews to Christ. These converts during the second half of the Tribulation are instructed to remain to fight the enemy armies and will successfully defend the remnant of believers in Jerusalem from the attacks of the Antichrist forces near the end of the Tribulation. These two heralds make it clear that this is not about them, but rather it is all about Jesus Christ returning to earth as promised. And so their message is believe in Jesus Christ as Savior or perish. But who are they?
They have been here on earth before, and are Moses and Elijah – yes the exact same two who were on earth a couple thousand years ago.  They were last seen at the Transfiguration of Christ when Jesus talked with them as witnessed by Peter, James, and John (Matthew 17:1-9).  And so they will return to earth during the Tribulation to evangelize and provide spiritual guidance to the believers of that time and serve as heralds to proclaim the coming of the Lord (Malachi 3:1) 	The world leaders will hate them and their message about Jesus Christ, and will want them dead. But the two have special divine powers to repel attacks and even kill attackers. They can cause drought, plagues, and disasters at will to demonstrate the validity of their message. It will only rain when and if they allow it. If attacked, they will kill with a word from their mouth."
Back in Jerusalem the two new witnesses Moses and Elijah attract a large crowd on the Temple Mount. But they do not enter the new Temple. Instead, they remain outside and preach to the crowds. Moses begins:
"Prepare the way for the Lord, Who will return in exactly 1260 days.  He is Jesus Christ, Who was crucified in this city.  He was and is your Messiah.  Accept Him as your Savior.  The time is short.  The choice is yours, but act quickly.  He is coming to judge the world and remove all unbelievers, then He will reign on the earth for 1000 years in His Kingdom.  God has sent us to be your final warning. He will not delay His vengeance even one day beyond the time which has been set."
Moses continues to speak, denouncing what is occurring inside the Temple walls: "In this Temple there are daily animal sacrifices.  Such sacrifices were used in the past to point to the Messiah, but He has come, so the purpose for those sacrifices is gone.  The only true sacrifice acceptable to God was Jesus Christ, spoken of through the Old Testament rituals, but not through the current animal sacrifices.  These so-called spiritual leaders are false teachers who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as Messiah.  In 1260 days the Antichrist and his minions will be destroyed, and those who do not accept the only true Messiah Jesus Christ will be  destroyed along with him.  The Jews inside this Temple do not tell the message of Jesus Christ, but continue to refuse to believe in their Messiah.  They kill animals while the only true Sacrifice for sin has already offered Himself.  Do not join with them in their unbelief.  They will be set aside by the Lord Himself at His return.  Accept your Messiah Jesus Christ and you will be saved."
Elijah extends the message: "Fellow Jews, Moses and I were here long ago.  We have lived out our lives and have also seen Heaven.  Now God has sent us back to you as a warning to accept the Messiah Jesus Christ as the only Savior.  The Antichrist is now on the earth, and Israel harbors a False Prophet.  They deceive and lie.  The Antichrist pretends to be a god.  But the only true God will send them into the Lake of Fire in just 3 1/2 years.  The message of the Antichrist and other followers of Satan is one of evil, hatred, and violence, which is the way of Satan.  God has sent us as messengers of His love and salvation, which He has made possible through His Son Jesus Christ the Messiah, Who is now at His right hand.  But the time is short.  Fellow Jews, prepare the way for the Lord's return.  He is indeed the Messiah, the only Savior; the one your fathers missed, but remains available to your generation.  During the past 3 1/2 years you have seen Tribulation, as the first six Seals were broken open to reveal judgments on the earth.  As difficult as they were, these were just a pinprick compared to what is coming.  As of now, this is the beginning of the Great Tribulation, the Seventh Seal.  There will now be seven Trumpet Judgments and seven Bowl Judgments.  You will face disasters never before seen on this earth.  They will be awesome in their power, and terrible in their destruction.  And then the Lord will return.  Your eternal salvation, and your survival on the earth during the next 3 1/2 years, are both at stake.  Only those who are secure by faith in the Lord can stand against them."
People listening begin to talk among themselves asking if these two can really be the Moses and Elijah of old. They are amazed at the power of their speech, and the message rings true to many of them. One young man says he knows where the believers met before they fled to the mountains, and said they had left behind a Bible and some books for those who would remain in Israel. Several set off together to go find the books. As they do, a large earthquake is felt.
News reports later that day report a 9.8 earthquake occurred in Asia over 2500 miles away.
In Petra, Jordan, Josh says to his fellow Jews who are in hiding: "Our task now is to survive until the Lord returns, just as our previous leader Shem had said many times.  We are the core remnant of believers who will go into the Millennium and live another 1000 years with our Lord as our Ruler.  Do not be deluded by calls to return to Israel.  Do not be fooled that you can go back and help your fellow Jews during the coming trials.  The Bible is clear that we must remain and wait patiently for the return of the Lord.  It will be hard to stay here when we know our fellow Jewish believers are suffering.  But the Word of the Lord is clear.  We will stay, we will survive, and we will be delivered.  But the Word of the Lord says this is just the beginning of the Great Tribulation.  What has been seen so far is nothing compared to what is yet to come.  And come it will.  Let me outline what is about to occur during the next 3 1/2 years:
Seal 7 will be opened next, and it begins a series of judgments which will include 7 Trumpet and 7 Bowl Judgments. They will occur in the following sequence:
Trumpet 1 – 1/3 of all vegetation destroyed, and 100% of all grasses destroyed 
Trumpet 2 – 1/3 of sea life destroyed, plus 1/3 of all ships
Trumpet 3 – 1/3 of fresh water polluted/destroyed
Trumpet 4 – sunlight diminished by 1/3, moon and star light diminished by 1/3 
Trumpet 5/Woe #1 – demon attack #1 on humans -- stinging demons
Trumpet 6/Woe #2 – demon attack #2 on humans -- killer demons
Near end of Tribulation (probably last year of Tribulation), the Bowl Judgments will occur: 
Bowl 1 – painful sores cover the bodies of unbelievers
Bowl 2 – sea water completely destroyed – all remaining sea life dies 
Bowl 3 – drinking water destroyed
