
ASPIRIN

Aspirin is the drug which has been used longest to relieve the pain of arthritis.

Aspirin is an irritant to the stomach lining, so severe an irritant that it is not

advised for ulcer patients. Taking aspirin may cause any or al of the

fol owing: nausea, heartburn, stomach pain, deafness, dizziness, ringing in

the ears, intestinal bleeding or hemorrhaging in other parts of the body.

Aspirin destroys vitamin K, which aids in coagulation of the blood.

CORTISONE IS NOT THE ANSWER





An announcement of the discovery of cortisone was met with great joy and

excitement by doctors and arthritis sufferers. Stiff joints would become mobile and pain

free, and crippled patients would be able to walk. To mil ions of people with arthritis

around the world, cortisone held out the great promise that at last an effective remedy for

the disease had been found. But the exalted enthusiasm was replaced by cruel

disappointment. It soon became evident that "the remedy was worse than the disease".

Cortisone has caused so many toxic reactions and dangerous side effects that it is now

considered "on the way out" in the treatment of arthritis.

Instead of drugs, God has given us herbs for the healing of the body. Two herbs

that are particularly beneficial for arthritis are burdock root and black cohosh. Use these in

tea form for best results. Bring distil ed water to a boil. Remove from heat, add 1-2 tsp.

herb per 8 ounces of water and let steep 20 minutes or longer. Strain and drink.

CHOCOLATE





Last year Americans bought over 3 bil ion pounds of candy; over 55% of it was

chocolate. Over 85% of the cocoa consumed in this country is in the form of candy.

Chocolate comes from the cacao tree, a smal , beautiful tree indigenous to the

tropical regions of the world. Cacao beans are produced in pods from 6-10 inches long

when mature, varying in color from green through reds and yel ows. Each pod contains 25

- 50 beans. The average tree bears al year long but yields about 2 pounds of dried beans

per year. The pod has a white pulp which is delicious to the taste, but the seeds are bitter

and astringent. It is from the seeds that chocolate is made.



The beans are piled in the yards of the farmers where they are left to ferment, a process

which takes from three to eight days. At the peak of the fermentation the temperature may

reach 140 degrees F. The fermentation is essential for

the development of the chocolate flavor. During

fermentation the bean's own enzymes and wild yeasts

enhance the fermentation process. It has been shown

that large quantities of aflatoxin can be found in cacao

beans.(1) Aflatoxin, a cancer producing agent from molds,

is one of the most potent cancer producing agents

known. During the fermentation process, children and

adults walk over the piles, and insects (especial y

cockroaches), rodents, smal animals, and other living things make their nests in the piles

of cocoa beans. It is not practical or feasible to remove al of the dead insects and their

excreta from the cocoa beans, so a large amount ends up in your chocolate candy bar,

hot chocolate, etc.

A booklet published by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare

cal ed "The Food Defect Action Levels" lists the defect levels in chocolate in the form of

"insect, rodent, and other natural contaminants" that are al owable by the PDA. Cocoa

beans are "permitted to contain an average of 75 microscopic insect fragments per 50 gm.



92

and an average of 2 rodent hairs per 50 gm. (50 gm is approximately 3 tablespoons).

Animal excreta must not exceed 10 mil igrams per pound. Many individuals who believe

themselves to be al ergic to chocolate are in fact al ergic to the animal parts in the

chocolate.

Because of chocolate's high fat content, it can act as a carrier of salmonel a

bacteria which is a type of food poisoning characterized by nausea, vomiting, and

diarrhea. Also brand-name chocolate candy bars come contaminated with carcinogenic

weed kil ers and wood preservatives. Traces of these and other dangerous substances

were found by the independent testing laboratories of WARF Institute in five brands of top-

sel ing candy bars (although the E.P.A. safety levels supposedly do not permit any of

these to be present).



Chocolate contains Theobromine, Theophylline and Caffeine, with the principal one

being Theobromine which can cause abnormal gland growth, central nervous system

stimulation, sleeplessness, depression and anxiety. Theobromine salts are known to

cause upset stomach, flushing of the skin with a warm sensation and itching. Theophylline

can cause irritation of the stomach, with discomfort, nausea and vomiting, as wel as

stimulation of the central nervous system. Caffeine is classified by the pharmacology tests

as a "central nervous system stimulant". A fatal dose of caffeine is 10 grams, the amount

in about 70 cups of coffee.

Would you use chocolate, drink coffee, colas, etc. or use caffeine containing

products (see chart) if you knew they were going to slow you down? Anything with

caffeine in it is considered a stimulant. If you use stimulants, keep this basic concept in

mind: what goes up must come down. The person who has to rely on products containing

caffeine has created a seesaw existence which finds him on top of a mountain or down in

a val ey, with fatigue as his constant companion. Stimulants, such as caffeine, give us

energy without giving us adequate fuel. Stimulants increase nearly al vital body functions.

Chocolate is very harmful to one's body and can cause a long list of health

problems. Listed below are some of these problems:



â€¢ Increased heart rate and force of contraction,

â€¢ high blood pressure and temporary irregular

â€¢ heart beat (2)

â€¢ Stomach disorders and diarrhea

â€¢ Increased kidney and bladder action

â€¢ Nervousness, irritability and depression (3)

â€¢ Sleeplessness

â€¢ Birth Defects

â€¢ Cystic breast disease (4)

â€¢ Bedwetting

â€¢ Enlargement of the prostate, etc., etc., etc.





CHOCOLATE VERSUS CAROB



Nutritional y, carob is everything that chocolate is not. Gram for gram, carob

contains three times the calcium that milk does. It is high in phosphorus and potassium,

plus it contains some sodium and iron. Carob is rich in protein and high in natural

carbohydrates. Although very sweet, it is 60 percent lower in calories than chocolate.

While chocolate is a robber of nutrients, carob is a replenisher. Carob has as much

thiamine (Bl) as asparagus or strawberries, as much niacin (B3) as lima beans, lentils or

peas, and more vitamin A than eggplant or asparagus. As an added bonus, it has 46



93

percent natural sugar, where cocoa has only 5 1/2 percent. Carob is low in fat whereas

chocolate is high in fat. Carob contains no caffeine or other stimulants, and best of al

contains no insect fragments.

Where does carob come from? It comes from the carob tree, a beautiful evergreen

tree rounded in form, with somewhat oval-shaped glossy leaves. The carob tree stands as

tal as 50 feet when ful grown. The pods are flat like lima beans and measure from 3 to 12

inches in length. They are rich dark brown in color. The pods contain 5-15 seeds which

are discarded.

CHOLESTEROL





Cholesterol is a substance that can only be found in meat, poultry, fish, and animal

products such as eggs, milk and cheese. Foods from the plant kingdom such as fruits,

vegetables, grains, nuts, etc., do not have any cholesterol.



There are two types of cholesterol: one is the high density lipoprotein cholesterol

(HDL) which the body manufactures and is necessary for the maintenance of optimum

health; the second type is low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) which is the bad

cholesterol that causes most of the trouble. Meat, animal products, oils, fats and grease of

al kinds are the foods most responsible for low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL).

Therefore, these items should be eliminated from the diet.(1) The ideal diet for lowering

cholesterol is a diet low in natural fats and protein (such as avocados, nuts, etc.) and high

in complex carbohydrates, which are whole grains, vegetables, legumes (peas & beans),

tubers (potatoes), fruits, honey, etc.



Cholesterol can also be reduced by eating a diet high in fiber. Al grains are high in

fiber. Hard red spring wheat was reported in 1978 by a United States Government

scientist to cause a 17% decrease in low density lipoprotein cholesterol.(2) If people ate

complex carbohydrate food that contain natural fiber we would not have today's epidemic

of high cholesterol. The more natural the food the better. Oat bran, for example, is not a

whole natural food, for the bran has been removed from the oat. It would be better to use

oatmeal as opposed to oat bran.



Another way to help lower cholesterol is by sunbathing. It is important to note that

cholesterol and Vitamin D are related, for when cholesterol in the skin is exposed to

sunlight, it may easily be changed to Vitamin D and thereby made harmless to the body. It

was in 1904 that one research scientist discovered that sunlight was able to transform

cholesterol to Vitamin D. Human skin has a very rich supply of cholesterol, and this

cholesterol keeps moving back and forth between the skin and the blood stream. If it is

removed from the skin, then the cholesterol from the blood stream moves into the skin to



95

replace the cholesterol that was lost. It has been found that sunlight wil cause a reduction

of cholesterol in the skin and it also affects the overal cholesterol metabolism of the whole

body. When the skin is exposed to sunlight, cholesterol is destroyed so rapidly and to

such a great extent that the total body cholesterol is decreased. A study was done using

30 patients who had hardening of the arteries. Each of these patient's blood cholesterol

level was taken before a sunbath. The results showed that there was almost a 13%

decrease in the blood cholesterol fol owing the treatment.(3)

You may wonder then, if I sunbathe to lower my cholesterol, what do I do about the

possibility of getting skin cancer from al the sunbathing? According to Dr. Kime, in his

book, Sunlight Could Save Your Life, if you take a moderate amount of sun and do not eat

meat, animal products or refined oils, your chances of getting skin cancer are rare. There

is little doubt in the research literature, as to whether or not a high fat diet promotes a

higher and earlier incidence of skin cancer due to ultraviolet light.(4)

For years we have accepted cholesterol levels of 250-300 mg% as "normal" in our

society because ninety percent of Americans fal into that range. While these levels may

be common for Americans, (where every second person dies of atherosclerosis), they are

not ideal. The ideal cholesterol is 100 plus your age, not to exceed 160 mg%. Dr. Antonio

Gotto M.D., president of the American Heart Association, stated in a U.S. Senate hearing,

that if we lower the cholesterol count of everyone in the United States to below 150 mg%,

we would probably wipe out heart disease. (5)



There are several cholesterol lowering drugs. Big expensive investigations of these

drugs report success in reducing blood cholesterol by levels of five to ten percent.

Unfortunately, none of these drugs improve life expectancy. On the contrary, they prove

more harmful than helpful. They produce unpleasant and distressing effects and

excessive mortality. (6)



The more we learn about cholesterol, the more we realize that by fol owing a

natural diet, the one given to us in the Garden of Eden, the healthier we wil be.

DEODORANTS

AND ANTIPERSPIRANTS





Perspiration is a normal body function. Basical y, three things are accomplished by

sweating: the body temperature is control ed by cooling, certain wastes are removed from

the body, and the skin is kept smooth and pliable.

Sweat never lets up: the body is constantly perspiring - up to a quart per day - even

when one is immersed in water.

Most perspiration is produced by a secretion from the endocrine sweat glands -

glands distributed over almost the entire surface of the body's skin. The eccrine glands are

usual y active only during exercise, on hot days or during nervousness or embarrassment.

Mil ions of Americans are concerned about the perspiration problem and what to

buy to combat the problem. Americans spend close to two bil ion dol ars ($1.7) on

deodorants and antiperspirants each year.

Mum was the first commercial personal deodorant product sold in this country in 1888. It

contained bacteria-squelching zinc oxide and was smeared on with the finger. Before this,

ammonia and water, talcum powders and perfumes had been used. Antiperspirants came

a few years later, but the early products in this field were plagued by a number of

problems. At that time, many antiperspirants were a solution of aluminum chloride.



Is there a difference between a deodorant and an antiperspirant? Yes! A deodorant

prevents the development of odor in perspiration. It is designed to combat odors, but wil

not keep you dryer since it does not reduce the amount of perspiration. Deodorants simply

mask odor. An antiperspirant reduces the amount of perspiration that reaches the skin's

surface. It is designed to reduce the amount of wetness.

Antiperspirants are more complicated, both in composition and action. Like

deodorants, they almost always contain bactericidal agents. However, they do not stop

there, as it's their intention to prevent moisture, as wel as odor. Their containers always

show a listing of active ingredients, the most common of which is aluminum salts -

chloride, sulfate, chlorohydrate, although zinc, zirconium and other compounds are also

found. In composition and action, antiperspirants are very similar to facial astringents.

Antiperspirants contain astringents that swel and coagulate protein in the skin, thus

reducing the pores through which perspiration is discharged. Astringents are composed of



97

various aluminum salts. This aluminum is readily absorbed through the skin, and we know

that aluminum is a poison to the human body.

Cleanliness is the first step in combating perspiration. A daily bath or shower

(preferably at night) fol owed by thorough rinsing is mandatory. Also drinking a minimum of

2 quarts of water daily wil help

keep the blood stream clean which wil reduce the amount of poisons the skin has to

eliminate.

A natural deodorant one could use is a fresh lemon cut in half and rubbed under the

arms; or one can find a few good natural deodorants in Health Food Stores. Be sure to

read the labels for the list of ingredients to determine if it real y is natural.



98





DIABETES





About 10 mil ion persons in the United States have diabetes, although almost half

of them are unaware that they are diabetic. Three out often diabetics end up in the

hospital every year. Eight out of ten diabetics develop eye problems. Diabetes is the

leading cause of new blindness. Diabetics are eighteen times more likely to experience

severe kidney damage than are non-diabetics: 25 percent of kidney dialysis patients are

diabetics. Diabetes more than doubles the risk of heart disease and stroke.

There are two types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is cal ed insulin-dependent

diabetes or juvenile diabetes. The onset is sudden in children and young adults and

accounts for about 20 percent of al known cases of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is known

as non insulin-dependent diabetes or Adult onset diabetes. This type affects people of

middle-age and older. Of this group at least 90 percent are obese.



SYMPTOMS

The most common symptoms of diabetes include constant hunger, frequent

urination, being always thirsty, weakness, loss of weight, mental depression, dry red

tongue, blindness, irritability, restlessness and poor circulation. Not al these symptoms

are present in every case.

The normal blood sugar is 80-120 mg/dl., but can rise after a meal up to 150

mg/100 ml. of blood. When the blood sugar exceeds 180, it wil spil over into the urine. To

excrete the sugar, water is taken from the tissues causing frequent urination and

increased thirst. The appetite is often increased because we are not ful y utilizing the food

we normal y eat.

A diabetic coma is caused by not enough insulin, causing high blood sugar.

Symptoms are headache, thirst, frequent urination and fatigue. The face becomes red, the

skin hot and dry, and the breath has a sweetish odor. Nausea and vomiting sometimes

occur. Respirations become rapid and the pulse increases. If insulin and fluid are not

given immediately the person wil lose consciousness.

Insulin shock is caused by too much insulin causing low blood sugar. Its symptoms

are nervousness, pal or, hunger, perspiration and behavior that resembles intoxication. If a

complex carbohydrate (such as ripe fruit) is not given promptly, the individual becomes

drowsy, disoriented and eventual y unconscious.



99

In 1981 diabetics in the United States needed the glands of 56 mil ion animals to

meet their insulin needs. To produce a single pound of animal insulin, the amount required

to maintain approximately 750 diabetics for a single year, 8,000 pounds of glands from

23,500 animals were required. In the past, insulin was obtained in tiny amounts

exclusively from the glands of pigs and cattle supplied by slaughter houses.



Insulin, a preparation used in the medical treatment of diabetes, is prepared from

animal pancreas, usual y pork or beef; there is also human insulin available. Orinase,

Tolinase, Diabinese or Dymelor are oral medicines which many Type 2 diabetics take.

These medicines are not insulin, but drugs that stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin.

There are many natural ways to stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin without taking

the drugs which have side effects.



NATURAL WAYS TO HELP

Diet - There is not a known remedy that wil cure diabetes without a reformation

along the lines that caused it. The number one dietary consideration for diabetes must be

a strict vegetarian, low calorie, alkaline diet of high quality natural foods. Plenty of whole

grains, bran and oatmeal are very beneficial in diabetes, as wel as raw vegetables of al

kinds - red cabbage, cauliflower, watercress, brussel sprouts, okra, cucumbers, onions,

etc. A big emphasis needs to be placed on raw foods as they stimulate the pancreas and

increase insulin production. Green beans and cucumber juice contain a hormone needed

by the cel s of the pancreas in order to produce insulin. No table sugar should be used.

When sugar is eaten and absorbed into the blood stream, it requires insulin and a trace

element cal ed chromium to move the sugar from the blood stream into the cel s where it

can be burned for energy. In the diabetic the insulin is missing. Therefore sugar piles up in

the blood stream and cannot move into the cel . When insulin is given, the sugar is able to

move into the cel and the sugar level wil drop in the blood stream. If chromium is missing,

the blood sugar wil rise again, for the sugar is stil not able to enter the cel . Chromium is

available in many natural foods (especial y whole grains), but most of it is removed when

foods are refined. The average American diet is lacking in chromium. At birth we have a

good supply of chromium, but as we get older we gradual y lose it if we do not eat

properly. Many older individuals are deficient in chromium. Why is this happening? When

refined sugar is eaten, it requires chromium to be utilized. If none is taken in with food,

chromium from the body stores, if available, has to be used. Thus chromium is gradual y

depleted and sickness occurs.



What about fresh fruits, as they contain sugar? Fresh fruits of al kinds are excel ent

for the diabetic.(1) The sugar in fresh fruit is fructose sugar and is very different from the

refined table sugar (which is sucrose sugar). When we eat sugar or starch our body

breaks it down into simple sugar and the blood then carries it to the cel s of the body. For

this simple sugar to enter the cel s it needs insulin and chromium, but if you have eaten

only fructose sugar (the good kind that is found only in fresh fruits), no insulin is needed

for the sugar to enter the cel s. This is why a diabetic can eat al the fresh fruit desired, but

no canned or frozen fruit juices (even if they are supposedly al natural). Al of these are

refined; they have been heated (even the frozen ones) and are hard for a diabetic to

assimilate.

Use no free fats - only natural fats as found in avocados, nuts, etc. Recent studies

show excess fat intake can decrease the number of receptors and/or deactivate them.

This results in the gradual build up of sugar in the bloodstream. Dr. James Anderson, one

of the most respected authorities on diabetes in the world, did a study with Dr. Kiehm.

They took thirteen diabetics off the 34 percent fat, 23 percent protein diet prescribed by

the American Diabetes Association and fed them a 9 percent fat diet of mostly natural high



100

fiber, starchy foods. Blood sugar levels were significantly lowered in al thirteen. Al five

patients taking oral drugs and four of the eight patients taking insulin were able to

discontinue their medication completely. (2)



Diabetics should discontinue the use of baking powder or soda, as these decrease

the activity of the pancreatic juices, which are used in the body to digest protein, fats and

carbohydrates. The pancreas is one of the most important organs of digestion.



Fasting is usual y not advisable for diabetics. Avoid al mental nervous stresses and

strains. Avoid constipation; the bowels must be kept loose with at least three good

eliminations every day. This is imperative to improved health.





Herb Tea - Tea, made from any one of the fol owing herbs is beneficial: raspberry

leaves, red root or dandelion root. Mix one tsp. of herb per 8 oz. of distil ed water. Let

steep for 20 minutes or longer. Drink three cups daily.





Exercise - Exercise wil lower the blood sugar and enable the diabetic to require

less insulin.(3) Deep breathing and lots of exercise of hard physical labor wil help keep the

fire of the metabolic processes burning fast, and this wil diminish the need for insulin.



Sunlight - The effect of direct sunlight on the body's sugar metabolism paral els

that of insulin. Sunlight facilitates the absorption of glucose into the cel s of the body and

stimulates the body to convert its blood sugar (glucose) into stored sugar (glycogen).(4)

This is minimal in a normal individual but dramatic in diabetics. A diabetic must gradual y

expose his body to the sunlight. Diabetics who choose to sunbathe should always keep in

touch with their physician as their insulin dosage wil have to be decreased.

In conclusion, diabetes is unknown in countries where people can't afford to

overeat. Americans may be the richest people in the world, but they are also one of the

sickest. In America, a new diabetic is discovered every 50 seconds. I want to encourage

al to eat in moderation, only those things that are wholesome and natural.

ELECTRICAL CURRENTS





Our body runs on electricity. An electrocardiogram wil record the electrical activity

of the heart. An electroencephalograph records the electrical activity of the brain. Today

we know the human body runs on electrical energy.

Very few health professionals have any information on the electrical currents in the

body and how they can be altered to either produce good or bad results in the human

body.



WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?

No one real y knows what electricity is. We only partial y know how to use it and

how it works. This definition of electricity is given in Taber's Cyclopedic Medica Dictionary;

"A form of energy that exhibits magnetic, chemical, mechanical and thermal effects.

Electricity is formed from the interactions of positive and negative charges." The medical

field today uses electricity on the body. Three examples of this are found in electro

hemostasis, which uses high frequency current to stop bleeding; electroconvulsive

therapy, the use of electrical shock to produce convulsions; and electro analygesia, using

low intensity electrical currents to bring relief from pain. These forms of electrical

treatments may cause harm to the body, as they disturb the natural circulation of electrical

currents. Did you know that cancer cel s are weaker than normal cel s, and that cancer

cel s have a different electrical frequency than normal cel s?



NATURAL WAYS OF KEEPING THE BODYâ€™S ELECTRICAL CURRENTS

IN BALANCE



I'm sure, as research in this area goes on, more natural ways to keep the body's

electrical currents in balance wil be found. Two natural ways that I'm aware of are

breathing fresh outside air, and having the body in contact with the soil.





102





BREATHING FRESH AIR



Al air contains electricity. Air can be either positively charged or negatively charged.

Negatively charged air, which is the kind that is beneficial to us, is found in the open air,

especial y in the mountains or the country; these are examples of air

that has been undisturbed by pol ution. The air with the most negative

ions in it is ocean air, or the air near a river or waterfal , and the air just

after a rainstorm. Positively charged air is not beneficial to us and is

the air found inside a closed room. Al electrical appliances and

heating and air conditioning systems use up good negative ions and

give off bad positive ions. This is especial y true of TV's, computers,

microwaves and fluorescent lights. The air we exhale is also positively

charged.



As the number of positive ions increases, with a corresponding

decrease in negative ions, one may feel such adverse effects as headaches, nasal

obstruction, hoarseness, fatigue, dry throat and dizziness. Negatively charged air, on the

other hand, produces a feeling of exhilaration and wel -being. Negatively charged air also

has been shown to decrease the respiration rate and lower blood pressure, while

positively charged air has just the opposite effect. (1)



There are over 3,000 - 4,000 negative ions in one cubic centimeter of mountain air,

but only 100 negative ions in one cubic centimeter of air in an office building at the end of

an eight hour day. Thus, we can readily see that to keep our body's electrical currents high

in negative ions, and thus experience good health, we need a continuous supply of fresh

outdoor air. "The stomach, liver, lungs and brain are suffering for the want of deep, ful

inspirations of air, which would electrify the blood and impart to it a bright, lively color, and

which alone can keep it pure, giving tone and vigor to every part of the living machinery".

BODY CONTACT WITH THE SOIL



To help keep our body's electrical frequency correct, we should spend some time

outside each day working with the soil or standing (or walking) with our bare feet in direct

contact with the earth. Our body and the earth are both electrical; and you do not get an

electrical exchange with the earth when you are wearing shoes, as the soles insulate you

from the ground. Just a short time, (10 minutes min.) each day wil greatly benefit a

person. This exercise is especial y true for those who are nervous or emotional y

disturbed.



CONCLUSION



The more knowledge man acquires the more he realizes how little he actual y

knows. We stil have much to learn about the electrical currents that control the human

body. This is an area that has been sadly neglected in the health field and I hope that as

time goes on we wil understand more ful y the good and bad effects of electricity on the

body.

ELIMINATION





This is a subject that everyone talks about and usual y suffer bad experiences

about sooner or later in life. Over 80 mil ion Americans suffer from bowel problems.

Cancer is the second major cause of death in the United States and of al cancer deaths,

cancer of the colon ranks second only to lung cancer.



Toxic bowel waste matter within our body is a big factor in diseases of al types. A

person who eats 3 meals a day should have three bowel movements a day. If a person

eats two meals a day, then they should have two bowel movements a day. One should

eliminate the residue of each meal 15 to 18 hours after eating. When a person goes two or

more days without an elimination, al that waste is putrefying in the body and being

reabsorbed through the colon wal s. The body is thus being poisoned from within. It would

be the same as keeping some food in a covered garbage can for two days in a

temperature slightly above 98.6 degrees,



CAUSES





The major causes of constipation are poor diet, inadequate intake of water, lack of

physical exercise, emotional or mental distress, and the use of medications. Low Fiber

Diet - Most foods that are eaten today are highly refined and lacking in fiber and bulk.

Good health and regular eliminations depend on a lot of fiber. Unrefined grains, nuts,

legumes, fruits and vegetables are high in fiber.



All types of cheeses are the most constipating foods one can eat.



Fiber should be cal ed the staff of life. When people change from a soft diet (which

are foods lacking in fiber and bulk), to wholesome natural unrefined foods that take time to

chew, it is amazing how much better they feel in a short period of time. They themselves

are amazed at how much more stamina and strength they have. Fewer people would

experience constipation, if they would eat more foods containing fiber. Processed,

devitalized foods are lacking in fiber and bulk. They tend to be dry, sticky and pasty. They

have a tendency to stick to the insides of the colon like glue and are difficult to eliminate.

Dr. J. N. Morris states that a lack of fiber in the diet may be one of the major causes of

coronary thrombosis (blockage of the coronary arteries). (1)

Both British and South African medical scientists strongly insist that insufficient

numbers of bowel movements and too little fiber and bulk in the feces may often explain

the existence of gal bladder disorder, heart problems, varicose veins, appendicitis, clotting

in deep veins, hiatal hernia, diverticulosis, arthritis and cancer of the colon. This complete

turnaround in medical orientation comes from professional and respected surgeons and

biochemists.(2)

After a tremendous amount of research work done by the Senate Select Committee

on Nutrition and Human Needs, the fol owing conclusion was reported. They

recommended a 25 percent reduction in the consumption of fat, and a 25 percent increase

in carbohydrates (particularly in the form of whole grains, fruits and vegetables). the



104

committee cited the relationship between the current fat rich, fiber deficient American diet,
