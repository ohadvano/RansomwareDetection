He lets go of me and goes to sit back on the couch and picks up the controller, I take this as an opportunity to ask if either of them have seen Sam.
“Hey guys, have you seen Sam anywhere? She said she'd be at this party, but I can't seem to find her.”
Kellan thinks for a moment then nods. 'I saw her a few hours ago but she was more interested in our big sexy beast over here.” Kellan nudges Bane suggestively but receives what sounds like a menacing growl in return.
“Where is she now?”
Kellan shrugs. “I've no idea. One minute she was all over Bane, and the next she ran off crying.”
What could he have done to make her run off? “Bane?”
He doesn't acknowledge me. “Bane? What did you do?”
I wait a few seconds to see if he'll say anything but when I realize that he won't answer me, I march up to the TV and switch it off.
“What the fuck is your problem!?” He roars in agitation.
