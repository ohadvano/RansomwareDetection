“Like I don't mean anything to you anymore. She's only been in your life for a week and you're acting like she's more important to you than your own pack. It makes me angry that she's more of a top priority to you than I ever was, and I've been in your life for a long time!”
“Maybe that's because I care about her more than I ever cared for you.”
Silver looks as though she's been slapped. “What did you just say?”
From the corner of my eye, I see Kellan shake his head in frustration, unlike Bane who hasn't looked away from the TV.
“You never cared? After all those times we spent together?”
I feel as though I shouldn't be listening to this.
“I thought I did but, you were just a distraction.” Ryder clears his throat.
Silver nods. “That's the reason why you kept pushing me away? Because you care about her?” She points at me.
Ryder looks at me with a soft smile. “I do, yeah.”
