“We're gonna put her in the bathtub and fill it with cold water.”
He reaches over and turns the cold tap on then turns to me while the water runs. “You're gonna be alright.” He cups my cheeks. “I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.”
I can do nothing but stare at him. I try hard to say anything but stop when I realize that I can't. It's like I'm struggling to form words. Ryder notices and frowns at me.
With his hand, he opens my mouth and wheezes. “Her teeth are starting to break through.”
He turns back to the bathtub and turns the tap off. “Is that a good thing?” Sam urges.
“It's a good thing because it means that the change won't be as complicated.”
Ryder picks me up into a standing position and grabs the hem of my dungarees.
“What do you think you're doing?” Sam snaps as she pushes his hands away from me.
“What does it look like I'm doing? I'm undressing her.”
