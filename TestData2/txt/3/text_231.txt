Max wheezes. “Who do you think I'm looking at? I'm looking at you asshole considering you're the one who's beaten the crap out of me twice already!”
Ryder pushes himself off the couch, grabs Max by the collar of his shirt and slams him against the wall.
“Ryder, stop it!” I shout, hoping that Ryder's not stupid enough to make this situation worse than it already is.
“Say that again Fields. I fucking dare you!”
Max ignores Ryder and looks at me. “Why is it that girls always fall for the guy that thinks he's a hero when in reality, he just looks like a complete idiot?”
“Shut your mouth.” Ryder slams him against the wall again.
Max chuckles. “Is this going to be round three? I gotta tell you, Ryder. I wasn't prepared for a fight today.”
Ryder growls. “When are you gonna stop with the lies, Max? What are you trying to achieve here?”
Max smiles. “Wouldn't you like to know?”
