
â€¢Excellent source of the trace mineral manganese and a very good source of dietary fiber, iron and calcium

â€¢1 teaspoon cinnamon (approx 2000 mg) provides 0.38 mg manganese, 1.24 g dietary fiber, 0.85 mg iron and 27.84 mg calcium

Note: I did supplement cinnamon at least 2000 mg daily; two 500 mg capsules in the morning and two 500 mg capsules in the evening â€“ and sometimes mid-day. Cinnamon just has too many benefits not to include it in your diet, especially if you are dealing with diabetes. I still take at least 2000 mg daily.

Turmeric

â€¢Recommended: No RDA - Take 400 mg up to 3 times daily

â€¢Reduces fat deposits near the liver

â€¢Reduces LDL (bad) cholesterol and promotes production of HDL (good) cholesterol

â€¢Thins the blood

â€¢Reduces inflammation

â€¢When applied topically (on the skin) helps heal psoriasis, fungal infections and athleteâ€™s foot

â€¢Acts as an antibiotic when applied to skin and exposed to sunlight

Note: I did supplement turmeric-curcumin 400 mg daily. It is good for cholesterol levels and fat deposits near the liver. I still take 400 mg daily of turmeric.

Omega 3-6-9 Oils â€“

â€¢Recommended: Not established

â€¢Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to help keep cholesterol levels low, stabilize irregular heart beat, and reduce blood pressure

â€¢Omega-3 fatty acids are also natural blood thinners, reducing the "stickiness" of blood cells

â€¢The brain is 60% fat and needs omega-3 fats to function properly

â€¢Omega-3 fatty acids may help maintain healthy breast tissue and prevent breast cancer

â€¢Without a sufficient supply of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, the body will use saturated fat to construct cell membranes, resulting in cell membranes that are less elastic, a situation that makes the heart muscle stiffer and less able to return to a resting state

18

â€¢Omega-3 is important in helping cells resist infection with influenza and the herpes family of viruses by supporting healthy cell wall development that act as anti-inflammatory agents

â€¢Omega-3 and -6 fatty acids cannot be produced by the body.

â€¢Omega 6 fatty acids are a chain of polyunsaturated fatty acids, also called linoleic acid, an essential fatty acid

â€¢Omega 9 fatty acids can be produced by the body and are therefore not considered essential oils as the body can produce them as needed.

â€¢Food Sources: cold water fish (omega-3), flaxseed oil (omega 3-6-9) and borage seed oil (omega 6-9)

Note: I did supplement one 1200 mg soft gel of Omega 3-6-9 three times daily at my doctorâ€™s recommendation because of its health benefits for the heart and cholesterol. I do not use any cooking oil other than virgin coconut oil for cooking (see below), so I do not get omega-6 fatty acids in my diet naturally. If you do use cooking oils, chances are you get more omega-6 than your body needs. If so, donâ€™t use the omega 3-6-9 supplement. Use an omega-3 supplement containing fish oil. Today I continue to take the omega 3-6-9 twice daily.

Virgin Coconut Oil

â€¢Is a medium chain saturated fat that is good for you and easily metabolized

â€¢It does not denature like other oils when heated and cannot turn into trans fats

â€¢Does not contribute to bad cholesterol and raises good cholesterol in some people

â€¢Contains lauric acid, which supports the immune system

â€¢Research has shown that the shorter medium chain fatty acids found in coconut oil boost the bodyâ€™s metabolism, balance blood sugar and control diabetes, dissolve kidney stones, protect against cancer, raise body temperatures, and help provide greater energy. Results are a healthier, leaner body, more energy and healthier skin.

â€¢A small amount is all that is needed for cooking and frying, unlike vegetable oils.

Multi Vitamins

There are so many multi vitamins available from so many companies, with so many different mixtures and dosages. I choose one from the same company I get most of my other supplements, taking one each day.

Alkaline Drops

The drops are used to alkalize water, which in turn alkalizes the blood and the fluids in and around your cells. It is important to this program. I stopped using drops after I no longer needed medicine.

19

OXYGEN

Oxygen is the most important thing we need to support life. We can live for weeks without food, days without water, but only minutes without oxygen. It is necessary for all functions in our body. To convert nutrients to energy we need oxygen. There is no other element that is more important to life than oxygen.

A stroke happens when something interrupts the oxygen flow to the body. This usually happens in the brain when a ruptured blood vessel or a clot stops oxygen-rich blood from flowing. The result is lack of proper use of whatever that area of the body controls. I had a stroke in my brain March 6, 2007 while I was sleeping. The result was slurred speech, loss of movement on my entire right side (not just muscular movement of my arms and legs, but everything, including chewing, bowel control and all the little functions we take for granted) and an incredible sleepiness.

I discovered that hyperbaric oxygen treatment (A one hour treatment that involves increasing the atmospheric pressure while breathing oxygen rich air. The treatment allows your body to absorb up to 7 times the oxygen it can normally absorb.) has a phenomenal success rate in treating stroke suffers, diabetics, cancer patients, surgery patients, amputees and a myriad of other conditions and diseases. The treatment is $150 to $250 an hour and can get expensive since it isnâ€™t covered by most insurance for most conditions. As a stroke patient the doctors estimated 60 to 90 treatments to restore me close to normal. One treatment was very restorative and one day I hope to be able to have more treatments performed so that I might reverse my disabilities resulting from the stroke. It would be great to have the treatment at least once a month just for a terrific energy boost.

In the meantime I have discovered liquid oxygen. (It is a means to super oxygenate water. Some doctors say it wonâ€™t work because we get all the oxygen we need by breathing. But think of it logically. Water is hydrogen and oxygen. The digestive track absorbs water and the oxygen can also be used to fuel our cells. Maybe it is a placebo. But Iâ€™ve learned that if the medical system decries something, at least take a second look. It sure appears to work and gives more energy.)

The point is that oxygen is necessary for body functioning. Large doses of oxygen allow the body to heal itself faster. The lack of oxygen leads to a build-up of toxins, which leads to disease. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced during cellular energy production and released by the respiratory system. A build-up is extremely harmful. Notice it takes oxygen to produce CO2 and it takes oxygen for the CO2 to be released in the air we breathe. The more oxygen we have in our system, the more potential energy we have.

Around the world most people breathe shallowly. We only breathe about 25% of our lung capacity, robbing our bodies of rich oxygen that could be energizing us throughout the day.

20

Deep breathing creates a suction which literally pulls lymph from the bloodstream and increases the rate at which toxins are removed from the body.

"Deep diaphragmic breathing is the equivalent of having a vacuum cleaner in your immune system pulling the poisons out at a rapid pace."

â€” Dr. Jack Shields

Our lymph system carries away and excretes toxins in the body. This results in a clean, healthy environment for your cells to function at maximum. We have a pump, the heart, for blood flow. No such pump exists for lymph circulation. Lymph relies on movement and breathing for its circulation. By practicing deep breathing we create a suction pump to move lymph at 15 times the normal rate.

In addition, the lowest portion of the lungs has the richest blood flow and can provide the greatest exchange of oxygen into our bodies. Deep breathing draws more air into our lungs, causing them to fill, allowing for greater oxygen absorption.

One deep breathing exercise is to Inhale for 6 seconds, Hold that breath for 24 seconds, Exhale for 12 seconds. Kind of like when you were a kid and had a contest to see how long you could hold your breath under water. Perform something like this 3 times a day for a week or so and watch your energy levels increase. It takes practice, but the benefits are awesome.

Aerobic Exercise means to exercise with oxygen. Regular exercise provides so many benefits to the body. Besides developing a strong cardiovascular/circulatory system, aerobic exercise moves the lymph through the body, cleansing your system. It is also a fantastic way to get large concentrations of oxygen into your body, where the oxygen can work its wonders.

Aerobic exercise does not need to be hard. It should be at a comfortable pace, but it should get your heart beating and increase your breathing rate. The key to consider is that the longer the exercise, the better for you. Studies show that the benefits are additive, meaning you can break 20 minutes of exercise into four 5-minute sessions and get the same benefits of one 20 minute session. I personally feel more satisfied with one session. However, splitting exercise times can be a great way to get your exercise benefits with a busy schedule â€“

especially at work.

Training aerobically will increase your blood supply, boost your immune system, increase the oxygenation of your cells and promote the elimination of cellular wastes. Aerobic

21

exercise also produces endorphins, which drive away stress and depression and stimulate the immune system. Exercise also increases your levels of growth hormones; another reason to get our kids to exercise.

Examples of aerobic exercise: brisk walking, swimming, dancing, running, bicycling, rowing, stair climbing, jump roping, hiking, rowing, etc. Exercise can be fun. Choose an activity you enjoy and mix it up. Have fun! Remember when we were kids and playing was all the aerobic activity we needed?

22

WATER

Water is the second most important thing your body needs to live, right behind oxygen. You can live without food for weeks, but you can only survive for a few days without water. Everything in your body takes place in water. You need fluids for cellular function, to transport fuel and oxygen to the cells, to remove body waste, and to regulate your body temperature.

Our bodies are about 70% water. The bloodstream that carries nutrients, oxygen and hormones throughout is about 85% water. It also carries waste to the kidneys for removal. You need water for the kidneys to function properly to remove the waste. We need to keep our bodies hydrated to keep waste from accumulating. The brain is about 80% water and uses about 20% of blood flow even though it accounts for only 2% of our body weight. Dehydration leaves the brain with less energy and can even lead to depression.

Besides all of the other functions of water in our bodies, water helps maintain blood pressure and is important to keep our pH levels at optimum levels. Water itself is close to neutral on the pH scale, helping us maintain a slightly alkaline pH.

If you want beautiful, smooth skin you must keep hydrated. Water will keep your cells functioning, helps conduct the electrical charge of energy at the cellular level and is important in cooling us on a hot day and preventing sunburns. There are so many reasons to drink plenty of water.

Coffee, tea, sodas, juice from concentrate and beer are not water. Though water may be a component to the production of these drinks, they have a diuretic effect, causing the body to lose water. We already lose water through sweat, breathing, urine and waste removal. We donâ€™t need to cause additional fluid loss.

Drugs can have a negative affect on water concentrations. When I took high blood pressure medicine it caused my body to deplete potassium and thus retain water, increasing my blood pressure. The doctor then prescribed a water pill and potassium pill to remove the water to lower my blood pressure and restore potassium. If I didnâ€™t take medicine in the first place, but supplemented my potassium intake it seems it would have kept my blood pressure regular naturally. I could avoid three pills daily. No wonder the drug companies make a fortune. If you take one you may have to take more to counter the side effects.

How much water should you drink daily? Half of your body weight in ounces is a good start. That means if you weigh 150 pounds you should drink 75 ounces of water throughout the day. That amounts to drinking 5 of the 16-oz packaged plastic water bottles daily. I reuse my plastic bottles daily, filling them up each night to get them nice and cold and ready for the

23

next day. (I use the bottles for at least 2 weeks before recycling them. This saves a lot of money. By the way, many people say you should drink the water at room temperature. There is no statistical data to support this unless you eat a high fat meal followed by cold water. The cold water causes the fat to solidify, disrupting digestion.)

When using this program it is very important to drink plenty of water. The more water you can drink daily, the easier it is for your body to re-create an alkaline balance to your body fluids. The first few days will require more restroom visits and maybe some loose stools, but it passes after a few days as your system adjusts. The first few days I went all out and drank about 192 ounces daily. I found 150 ounces to be a much better fit after a few days. That is one more bottle per day than the formula above suggests. If you sweat more from summer heat or exercise, you may want to replenish the fluids lost with more water.

FOODS TO AVOID

PROCESSED OILS

By now everyone knows that hydrogenated fats and partially hydrogenated fats are very bad. We call them trans fats. Our bodies have the worst time processing them. They are like poison to body functions. The food industry has listened and you find less use of these oils, but they are still being used. Always check the label of processed foods to make sure they donâ€™t contain these oils. Even better, avoid processed foods.

These fats are from vegetable oils that denature while heating. Food manufacturers use them because they prolong the shelf life of foods. Not only do these fatty oils cause an accumulation of bad cholesterol (LDL), but they wipe out good cholesterol (HDL). They also wreak havoc on insulin, preventing it from bonding to glucose (sugar) molecules so it can be utilized by the cells, leading to obesity and diabetes. To maintain proper pH, the body canâ€™t let these molecules just keep floating around; fat is created to store these unutilized molecules.

Donâ€™t confuse these fats with all fats. There are fats our bodies do need. We call these essential fatty acids â€“ Omega 3-6-9 (see Nutrients section). Our body needs them to function at optimal efficiency.

General Rule of Thumb â€“ Do not cook with oil! Do not fry! Do not deep fry! Do not sautee! When you heat oil it denatures the oil, changing its chemical makeup. Plus Americans intake an estimated 26 times the fat we need by using even healthy cooking oils. I use water and add herbs and seasonings to season my foods. On the occasions I use salt for flavoring I use natural rock salt containing a lot of nutrients. After a short time you will notice how much the flavors of the foods pop out. Cooking with oils hides the true flavor of Godâ€™s bounty. Better yet, if you can eat it raw, the better the benefits to you. I personally save the water from stew and soup so I can drink all of the nutrients that wash out during cooking. Interesting note: foods like carrots, potatoes and cabbage that are more fibrous will actually produce more beneficial body-healthy fiber as you cook them and break down the cellulose fibers.

Use olive oil and other healthy oils in place of butter and margarine and in salad dressings. But limit how much you use.

Note: Virgin coconut oil is the only oil that does not denature no matter the heating temperature. If I want to fry something, or to cook with oil, virgin coconut oil is the only oil I will use. It is 100% natural. It has so many healthy benefits and is good for you. (See

25

Nutrients section for more info on health benefits.) I use it instead of butter and margarine for buttering a potato or toast, for baking healthy cookies and for salad dressing. Interestingly it is solid until about 80 degrees, so you have to heat it slightly to use it as salad dressing. Do not use internally if it doesnâ€™t say â€˜virginâ€™ coconut oil. Plain coconut oil is bleached and processed.

MEATS

Not eating meat is hard for me, as I grew up with meat as a part of almost every dinner. I was taught that meat was an important source of protein. It was necessary. I could never understand cultures that ate predominately vegetables and fruits and very little meat. I read of one such culture that might share a chicken thigh among 4 to 5 adults, while I would consider 2 to 3 pieces of fried chicken at a meal about right. So, I did a little research to see if I could find out something to convince me to at least cut back my meat consumption.

Did you know that broccoli is about 48% protein? Vegetables and fruits not only contain vitamins and minerals in abundance, but are the best source of fiber that rids the body of excess fats, cleans the intestines and controls hunger. That fiber is produced from proteins, just as our structure of muscles is built from protein. Did you know the strongest animals in the world eat plants? Horses, elephants, elk, gorillas and others are vegetarians.

I was always told that athletes needed animal protein to reach peak performance, but I found that protein from meat is not only hard for the body to digest, but an excess of protein leaches calcium from your body, making your bones weaker. Besides, our bodies produce 70% of the protein we need. If we put stress on our bodies to develop more strength and power, our bodies step up to produce what we need from the foods we eat, especially vegetables. Think about when we have the greatest protein needs in as lives. It is as we are growing. Motherâ€™s milk is only 2% protein. Yet the first years of life are when we grow and develop most.

Consider some world class athletes: Sixto Lenares is a world record holder in the triathalon. He cycled 185 miles, swam 4.8 miles and ran 52.4 miles in one day. Peter Burwash, a Canadian tennis player received the highest physical index of any athlete in Canada. Dave Scott won the Ironman Triathalon six times â€“ thatâ€™s a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile cycling and 26.2 mile run. Donna McMahon is a USA athlete who has completed many marathons. These athletes did not eat meat or dairy products. If you want to see more famous vegetarians visit www.ivu.org/people/sports/.

Protein is the last source our bodies use for energy. Carbohydrates are used first; simple sugars from fruits and then more complex carbohydrates. Fats are used next, followed by

26

proteins last. In fact, our bodies donâ€™t like to metabolize protein. They only use protein if there is no other source of energy. Protein is used by the body to build, not to create energy.

Our bodies try to flush animal-based protein from our bodies because of the acidic nature of meat, leading to calcium leaching to maintain a balanced pH. Plant-based protein is so much easier for the body to process for its needs. Even then, excess protein in flushed from the body. Meats are high in protein and difficult for the body to metabolize. We just donâ€™t need the excess protein from meats.

Meat is difficult to digest and requires more enzymes to process through the stomach. Remember those reports about 5 pounds of meat sitting in your intestines? Thatâ€™s because meat putrifies in your intestines. Last time I checked â€˜putrifyâ€™ means rot. Yuck!

â€œChoosing meals built on whole grains, legumes,

fruits and vegetables is the best way to stay healthy.â€

- American Dietetic Association

Uric acid is the substance that gives meat its flavor, and actually comes from the urine of the animal that floods the body of the animal when it is killed. No wonder meat, especially beef, is high on the acidity scale of foods. An average piece of meat contains about 2Â½ times the uric acid the human body can effectively process daily.

The American Cancer Society has â€˜two fundamental foundationsâ€™ for preventing or treating cancer through diet. Eat more plant-based foods and eat less animal-based foods. Yet, how often do you hear that from your doctor?

Animal products have no fiber.

Environmental Reasons not to eat meat: If Americans cut their meat consumption by just 10%, enough grain could be saved to feed 60 million people. Isnâ€™t that an astounding figure? Imagine if all countries cut back on meat consumption. We would be able to feed the world, with excess. Did you know that 7 out of every 10 acres are used to grow crops for livestock, especially beef. That doesnâ€™t include pasture land. One acre of land produces 165 pounds of meat, while the same acreage can produce 20,000 pounds of potatoes. It requires 2500 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef and just 25 gallons to produce one pound of vegetables. Just imagine the savings in water, fertilizer, gasoline, etc. if we all just cut back consumption by 10%.

I still eat some meat, despite all the evidence against doing so. I applaud all those who do give it up completely. I have cut out about 90% of my former consumption, but I doubt I will ever entirely remove it from my diet.

27

MILK

â€˜Milk does a body goodâ€™ is a slogan most of us have heard. Itâ€™s used by the American Dairy Association to promote cowâ€™s milk. Raw milk has some great benefits, but processed milk as we get it from the store does not do our bodies good.

I grew up on cowâ€™s milk, believed the hype and have been told that milk is our best source of calcium. I grew up in an area where dairy was big business â€“ lots of dairy farms. I was taught that homogenization and pasteurization were very good for the milk. I have found that they are simply ways to mass produce dairy milk without strict standards for large production facilities. Pasteurization, heating/cooking of the milk to destroy any bacteria, actually makes calcium less bio-available, less digestible and actually denatures some of the proteins in milk.

Milk neutralizes hydrochloric acid in the stomach, making it much harder for the body to digest. Studies show that the people who drink more milk have the lowest calcium levels in their bodies. It is just not useable by the body in its grocery store form. If you can get your hands on certified raw milk, that does have benefits. Drinking processed milk actually makes the body less efficient at absorbing nutrients, not just from milk, but from all foods. This is caused by the mucous layer milk leaves on our stomach and intestines. Thatâ€™s why we are often told to drink milk for an upset stomach or to prevent absorption for some poisons.

Another problem with milk is its high protein content. Our bodies make 70% of what we need and get the rest from plant-based foods. Animal-based proteins found in milk are harder for the body to process and cause calcium leaching to try and rid the excess from our blood. Remember, calcium is used to maintain pH. Excess protein in the blood makes the blood more acidic and the body has to remove it.

Cowâ€™s milk is for calves.

SUGAR

Sugar is good for metabolism and is the first source of energy in our bodies. It is this source we need for instant energy. We get what we need from fruits and vegetable. Sugars from fruits, called fructose, are broken down by the body slowly and are converted into glucose and glycogen, energy sources for the cells. Glycogen is stored in the muscles for quick energy, while glucose is metabolized by the cells for their energy needs. Unlike table sugar your body canâ€™t use fructose until it is converted by the liver, usually into glycogen. Sucrose (table sugar) is instantly available and spikes blood sugar levels, which can overtax an overworked pancreas.

28

Processed sugar comes from sugar beets and sugar cane, with an end product of processed sugars (white sugar, brown sugar, etc) and molasses, while yet another sugar is produced from corn, making corn syrup. These sugars are so refined that they are readily digested and absorbed into our systems, often in greater quantities than our bodies need. They are acidic in nature and tax our bodyâ€™s pH maintenance systems.

Food manufacturers like to use corn syrup instead of sugar because it is less expensive. The problem is it is not as sweet. So they add fructose (fruit sugar) resulting in high fructose corn syrup. The body can only store so much glycogen, which is produced from fructose. The rest is stored by the liver as fat. The sucrose from the corn syrup is readily available to the cells, but unless you are burning it up exercising at the time, it cannot utilize it. Insulin spikes to process the sugar. If it canâ€™t be immediately used it creates an acid environment and the body triggers fat storage to equalize the acidic build-up. That is why high fructose corn syrup is not good for you. High fructose corn syrup is found in many of our processed foods today. The resulting health epidemic is already here with people consuming large quantities. Our bodies were never intended to process such high sugar content.

SODA POP

All those wasted years where I drank soda. Drinking regular or diet is like driving a nail in your coffin. High acidic pH, leaching calcium from your body, phosphoric acids blocking calcium absorption, sugar concentrations at max, sugar substitutes as bad or worse than sugar overloads, caffeine and mystery additives are all reasons not to drink soda. I dropped 20 pounds in one month when I gave up drinking sodas. Please stop drinking soda! Iâ€™m not afraid to die. I have a secure home for eternity. I just cannot understand how people when given the knowledge will push the limits instead of living a fulfilling life. I used to drink two 2-liter bottles daily. Iâ€™m paying for my ignorance.

ALCOHOL

Alcohol contains 7 calories per gram. These calories are empty calories and provide no nutritional value to the body. Alcohol is a depressant and depresses cell function and works the pancreas overtime correcting the acidic pH. There are studies that lead to the belief that beer is good for you because of the barley or hops or that wine is good for you because it is made from grapes. Why not just eat hops or barley or eat grapes or drink grape juice? In limited moderation beer and wine are probably fine. Be conscious of their effects.

29

CAFFEINE

Caffeine is a stimulant that causes an addiction while providing no nutritional benefit. It has an acidic pH and really provides no energy. It is used in many diet supplements because of its stimulating affect, but it actually taxes the bodyâ€™s systems.

The perk people feel from coffee is from the energy created by the body to neutralize the 200 acids it contains. Instead drink various teas â€“ dark teas, red tea, green tea and mate. They carry many antioxidants that are healthy to the body.

NICOTINE

Nicotine is an addictive, stimulating drug which taxes the body. Smoking is the number one preventable disease causing action. One million people a year die because of it. There is absolutely nothing good that smoking and nicotine produce. It also has a negative affect to create an acidic pH.

This section sounds like a death sentence to many vices. The choice is yours. There are many healthy alternatives. Do you want to live a quality life or to just scrape by?

GETTING STARTED â€“ WHAT I DID

My goal in trying this program was to reverse my diabetes by allowing my pancreas an environment to heal, to drop my blood pressure to normal levels, to raise my good cholesterol (HDL) and to start dropping some weight. If youâ€™ve read through to this part of the book you should have a good idea of the background of why I choose the various foods and supplements that I used on my program.

My first goal was to create an alkaline environment in my body to allow all of my systems to function correctly. I knew it would probably not be overnight. In researching pH studies on diabetics I discovered that 100% of participants who completed a 90 day alkalizing program had positive results. All of the people with Type II diabetes reversed their diabetes and had no need for medication by the end of the study. All of the people with Type I diabetes reduced their need for insulin by 50% or more, some completely. After 30 days there was a measurable positive benefit to everyone. I figured I could control myself for 90 days. They say you create a new habit in 21 days. So, I was ready to start.

I searched around the internet to find sources for alkaline drops, green foods and pH testing papers/strips. In the section on Nutrients I discussed greens. They are an important part of helping the body reach an alkaline balance. Alkaline drops help alkalize and charge water. The test strips were so I could track my progress.

I compared prices online and even visited a few health food stores and drug stores, hoping that I could find what I needed conveniently at a good price. Drug stores didnâ€™t carry the products, but would order them. A visit to Walmart turned up empty. Health Food Stores had high prices. Even online there were only so many choices. It was a challenge reviewing ingredients and trying to determine the best choice for me. I now order from http://HealthEssentialProducts.com They actually carry all three of the products I needed and have a selection of each, complete with links to ingredients. The cost is a few dollars more on the greens, but with $5 flat shipping they are the cheaper overall when adding the pH testing supplies and alkaline drops. Besides, I can order everything in one place.

As soon as the products arrived I started.

pH Program:

For the first 21 - 30 days I recommend a cleansing diet, which does not include any bread, pasta, meat, milk or milk products, sugar, table salt, vinegar or oils. Of course, coffee, caffeinated teas, sodas and alcohol in any form are a big no no.

31

Water is a big part of the program. You should be drinking at least Â½ you body weight in ounces. If you weigh 150 pounds then be prepared to drink at least 75 ounces of water, more if you can.

â€¢Upon waking I drank one Â½-liter bottle of water with 5 alkalizing drops. (Most places I read about alkalizing said to use distilled water. I did not. We refill our plastic bottles at home with water filtered through our Brita filter. I used that.)

â€¢For breakfast I drank a smoothie made from 1 banana, 5 strawberries, Â½ handfuls of blueberries, just enough water to cover the fruit and a tablespoon of greens. Once in a while I switched up the fruit with fresh peaches, cantaloupe, watermelon, etc.

â€¢A couple hours later I drank another Â½-liter bottle of water with 5 alkalizing drops, followed by a snack of a small handful of nuts (protein & fat) and an orange, grapefruit, apple, banana or some other fruit, or raw baby carrots and some sort of protein like peanut butter, tofu or nuts.

â€¢About Â½ hour before lunch I drank another Â½-liter bottle of water with 5 alkalizing drops

â€¢For lunch I ate a salad with lettuce, tomatoes, red peppers, cucumbers, mushrooms, kidney beans (from a can â€“ I washed all the beans first), broccoli, cauliflower, beets (not pickled) and red onions. Or I ate a yam, or potato or vegetable stew, etc. I mixed up what I ate for variety. But I kept to mainly vegetables.

â€¢ A couple hours later mid afternoon I drank another Â½-liter bottle of water with 5 alkalizing drops, followed by a snack of celery and peanut butter, an apple and peanut butter, carrots and a small handful of nuts, or tofu and a fruit.

â€¢About Â½ hour before dinner I drank another Â½-liter bottle of water with 5 alkalizing drops

â€¢For dinner I made a vegetable stew, a salad, pea soup, 12 bean soup, vegetables medley, baked potatoes loaded full of chopped vegetables or whatever I could serve to the family that was tasty but fit my diet. A vegetarian cookbook has lots of tasty ideas.

â€¢Then I didnâ€™t eat until about 15 minutes before bed, when I again drank another Â½-liter bottle of water with 5 alkalizing drops, followed by a snack with a fruit or vegetable and a protein and fat.

Some notes about this diet:

â€¢Besides the 6 Â½-liter bottles of water I drank before meals I had 2 to 4 more each day.
