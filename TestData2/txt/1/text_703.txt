“Keep telling yourself that Alice because we both know you wanted me.”
“It was a mistake!” I hiss.
Ryder looks angrily at me, shoves himself out of the chair and throws his chair to the back of the class.
Mr. Edmund remains seated in his chair with a look of boredom on his face.
“Get the chair and sit down Mr. King.” “Nah, screw this.”
He calls Bane and they both leave the classroom.
I sit in shock just as Mr. Edmund casually walks to the front of my desk.
“Let today be the first warning Alice, because disobedience is not tolerated in my classroom. Ever. Those two will definitely not be returning to this class after their behaviour this evening. One thing I will tell is that I would carefully advise you to think about who you surround yourself with.” He turns back to his desk. “You are dismissed, Alice.”
I quickly gather my things and rush out of the classroom.
