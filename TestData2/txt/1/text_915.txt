“You're always on that thing.” I frown. Who could she possibly be speaking to?
She puts her phone in her pocket and smirks. “I'm casually stalking an acquaintance of ours.”
“And who would that be? We've got a few of those recently.” I adjust the straps on my dungarees and put my hands in the pockets.
“Bane obviously.” Sam gives me this look as if she's saying to me, 'who else could it have been?'
“Okay, here's a question, why?”
“I think you know why.” Sam wiggles her brows.
I roll my eyes, she can't be serious. “Sam, you think that just because you've seen his genitals, you can stalk him?”
Sam's eyes widen. “Alice he is hung and I mean really hung. At this point, I don't even care about the fact that he turns into a wolf.”
I shake my head, look down at the other end of the corridor to see Ryder leaning against the lockers, looking in our direction.
