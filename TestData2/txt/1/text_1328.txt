He kicks the door again making the door slam against the wall and break off its hinges, caused by his strength. “How else are we going to get in?”
I stand in the doorway debating whether to go into the house or not. “We could've just waited for Max to get here!”
“Nah, that doesn't work for me.”
I roll my eyes. “Nothing ever works for you, does it?”
His head swings to my direction. “What the hell does that even mean?”
“Nothing. Just forget it.” I go into the house and look around. We stand across from each other in the living area in complete silence.
“So, what? We just wait for him to get here?” I take a seat on the brown leather couch while Ryder stands in the middle of the room. “That's the plan.”
“And we're just gonna talk to him.” Ryder says nothing.
“Right, Ryder? You've got to remember that he's not an Alpha like you, so no fighting, okay?”
