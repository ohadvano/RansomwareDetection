I take a sip from the mug and look at my best friend's mother. “Everything's fine and mom's always working at the hospital so I barely get to see her.”
Sally smiles warmly. “Your mother's always been a workaholic. I remember when your mother and I went to school together. She always carried a box of tissues with her at all times just in case someone got a nosebleed.”
I snicker. “Sounds like my mother.” I grab a piece of toast and take a bite.
“Everything alright at school? Sam mentioned that you've got a new English teacher?” Sally looks behind her at the clock and shakes her head.
I nod my head.
Do I mention what happened to Mr. Daniels to her or not?
“Yeah, Mr. Edmund has taken over the class.” I clear my throat. “And school? The same as always, I guess.”
Sally raises her brow. “Meaning?”
“Meaning...” Before I have a chance to answer I get interrupted.
