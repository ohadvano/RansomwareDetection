He clenches his jaw. “I'm not gonna leave you alone. You're gonna need me for the next change, and whenever that is, I'm gonna make sure that I'm there to help you. I don't care what you say, but I'll be there to make sure that you survive.”
I don't get a chance to respond because I feel another presence joining our little conversation. Ryder's head comes up and he's looking sternly at Max.
“Alice, I thought we lost you.” Max pulls out his hand and introduces himself to Ryder. “Hey man, I'm Max Fields.”
Ryder ignores him and walks away.
“What's his problem?” Max watches Ryder as he walks away with a look of confusion on his face.
“Yeah, that's Ryder.” I answer.
I watch Ryder walking towards his friends who are sitting at a bench near the football field.
“Were you two a thing or...?”
“Are you kidding me?” I burst out laughing. “No, we've never been a thing.”
