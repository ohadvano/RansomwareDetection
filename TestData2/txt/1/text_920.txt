“He's trying to protect me?” I place my bag over my shoulder. “What a load of shit.”
“Alice, you okay?” Sam looks at me with worry etched on her face.
“Yeah, I'll speak to you later.”
I rush out of the classroom and out towards the back of the school, to the empty football field.
When I reach the field, I slowly take a deep breath, hold it and release it.
There's no explaining my escape to Mr Edmund if he ever finds out. Who am I kidding? He's never gonna know.
I sit on the dry cut grass and look up at the sky.
Being alone with my thoughts is actually quite peaceful, but I can't help but wonder who was hurt last night. Could it be someone that I know? But I hope that whoever got hurt isn't suffering too much.
And Bane? I hope he shifts and never changes back. Never will I understand the reason he is the way that he is. The same goes for all of them except for Kellan.
