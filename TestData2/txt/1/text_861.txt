“Yeah, maybe.”
'Right, well I think you should rest and drink plenty of water, and I'll call the doctor tomorrow if you want before I go to work, okay honey? No school for you tomorrow.”
She kisses me on the forehead and helps me slowly off the floor.
“How was work?” I follow my mother into the kitchen, and sit on the bar stool as she turns off the TV.
I've missed Game of Thrones. Again.
“Work was a little hectic but I'm happy to be home. Everything okay in school?”' She brings the uneaten pizza, and the unopened can of coke, into the kitchen and sets them on the counter.
“School was okay I guess. We have a new English teacher.”
“A new teacher? What happened to Mr. Daniels?” “I don't know. Maybe he quit?”
I don't know why I didn't tell my mother about Mr. Daniels, but I don't think telling her that he was supposedly found ripped to shreds in his home a good idea.
