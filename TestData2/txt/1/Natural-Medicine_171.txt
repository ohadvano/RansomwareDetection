OLIVE OIL





Many health enthusiasts advocate the use of olive oil in the diet, and claim that it is

not harmful to the body as other fats. Olive oil is great for the outside of the body, but not

for the inside, as it is no different from any other refined oil. It is 100% fat. You wil never

find a more natural lotion than COLD PRESSED OLIVE OIL or FRESH ALOE VERA. It

wil do wonders for your skin. I have found that it helps with sore muscles, inflamed joints,

arthritis, etc.

Regular olive oil wil not work; it must be cold pressed. Heating destroys the oil.

Most manufacturers use the cheapest and quickest way possible of processing the oil.

The method most commonly used includes crushing the olive, mixing it with water, then

heating it at 230 degrees F for 30 minutes. Fol owing this, the crushed olives are run

through a press that exerts ten to twenty tons of pressure per square inch. The result of

this great pressure is the exposure of the oil to a great amount of heat and the destruction

of the natural elements found in the oil of the olive.

The natural oil that is found in the olive has to be extracted mechanical y without

heat to produce cold pressed olive oil. If you are not sure that the olive oil you purchased

is cold pressed, there is a simple way to find out. Put your bottle of olive oil in the

refrigerator (not freezer) and let it sit overnight. If it turns cloudy it is cold pressed. When

you rub cold pressed olive oil on your skin, within a half hour it wil be absorbed into your

body and your skin wil not feel sticky or greasy. If you rub regular olive oil on your skin, it

wil stil be there half an hour later. The heating process destroys the natural health

producing properties of the olive oil.

While I am on the subject of oils, I want to share with you information on linseed oil,

and cod liver oil. Linseed oil comes from the flax seed, which is a weed, not a grain. Some

bakeries put ground flax seed in bread or cereals. Those who do this do not know food

chemistry and its relationship to body chemistry. Flax contains cyanide. The leaves and

seed chaff contain the cyaniogenetic clycoside, linamarin. An enzyme (linamarase) is

present in the plant material which is capable of releasing cyanide from linamarin. Cases

of poisoning after ingestion of linseed cake, meal, or flax seed chaff have been reported in

al classes of livestock. Symptoms and lesions are those of cyanide poisoning(1).

What about cod liver oil? Leave it alone! It is from an animal source, and, for that

reason, is of more harm than benefit. I believe God wants us to use only those things that

wil promote good health. Today we should benefit greatly if we were to use on our skin

cold pressed olive oil instead of al the man-made greasy chemical creations.

OSTEOPOROSIS





What is osteoporosis? How do we get it? Can we prevent it through natural means?

Are there natural ways to treat and reverse it? Do we need to fear it? Is more calcium the

answer?

Our bodies are made up of a number of elements. The two most prevalent minerals

in bones are calcium and phosphorus. When calcium is lost from the bones over a period

of time, the bones become porous and brittle and can easily break. This is osteoporosis, a

loss of weight and density in the bone cel s, and the development of a spongy rather than

solid texture of the bones.

The disease actual y consists of two aspects, the loss of bone material resulting in

an enlargement of the spaces in bones. With less material, the appearance of the bones

becomes porous. What looked solid like rock now appears as a sponge.



IS MORE CALCIUM THE SOLUTION?

Very often we have been told that increasing the intake of high-calcium sources,

such as dairy products, wil both prevent and reverse osteoporosis. Is this true?

Two investigators, doing independent research, suggested at the meeting of the

American Society for Bone and Mineral Research in 1986 that dietary calcium bears no

relationship to the development of osteoporosis(1).



Michael Parfitt, osteoporosis researcher at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan,

observes that the 1984 National Institutes of Health (NIH) panel report, recommending the

use of calcium to prevent osteoporosis, is based on weak evidence(2).

B. Lawrence Riggs, Mayo Clinic researcher, reported a study of 107 Rochester,

Minnesota women, 23 to 88 years old. Dr. Riggs fol owed them for 4.3 years, with

repeated measurement of their bone density. Calcium consumption in the study group

ranged from 269 to 2000 mil igrams daily, but the researchers could demonstrate no

relationship between bone loss and calcium intake, even on the lowest calcium intake(3).

Dr. C. Christiansen from Gosstrup Hospital in Denmark reported a two-year study in

which 43 women were placed on calcium supplements, placebos, or estrogen. Calcium

was ineffective in preventing bone loss(4).

Dr. Mazees states that in population studies adjusted for body size and ethnic

origin, individuals with high calcium intakes did not have denser bones than those on low

calcium intakes(5).

Dr. Richard Mazeses of the University of Wisconsin cal s calcium "the laetril of

osteoporosis11, and points out that there are no studies evaluating the safety or efficacy

of calcium supplements. It is known that high calcium intakes can interfere with vitamin D

utilization (also necessary for bone cel formation), and may cause kidney stones (6) .

Approximately 20 mil ion people in the United States are affected by osteoporosis.

Most of them do not understand why they are suffering with this disease. Many of these

people are taking calcium supplements, and believe that this should relieve their

problems. Calcium supplement sales were estimated to have reached 166 mil ion dol ars

in 1986(7).



159

Tragical y, most of these people should not be using this extra calcium, for excess

calcium in the body has several adverse side effects. It has been shown that excessive

calcium is picked up by the blood and deposited in the soft tissues, the blood vessels,

skin, eyes, joints, and internal organs. Little wonder we suffer.

In the blood vessels, calcium combines with fats and cholesterol to cause

hardening of the arteries. In the skin, excessive calcium causes wrinkling. In the joints it

crystal izes and forms very painful arthritic deposits. In the eyes, it solidifies into cataracts.

And in the kidneys, it forms hard deposits known as kidney stones. Thus it becomes

evident that taking extra calcium does much harm, rather than benefit to the body.



WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF OSTEOPOROSIS?

The major cause of osteoporosis is eating too much protein, especial y in

combination with fat, such as is found in meat and animal products. Most Americans, as

they enjoy their steaks and hamburgers, are eating far too much protein At present, the

World Health Organization suggests a minimum daily protein requirement of about 40

grams. The RDA recommendation is about 55 grams a day. But the average American is

getting over 100 grams a day.

What happens to al this excess protein? First it is broken down into amino acids,

some of which are metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys as urea.

Along with the urea and amino acids excreted into the urine go large amounts of minerals.

One of the minerals lost is calcium; and studies show that the more protein you use, the

more calcium you lose.

The many studies performed during the past fifty-five years consistently show that if

we want to create a positive calcium balance that wil keep our bones solid, then the most

important dietary change that we can make is to decrease the amount of protein we eat

each day.

Some other causes of osteoporosis are smoking, drinking alcohol, coffee, soft

drinks, eating too much salt, taking antacid, insufficient exercise, and lack of sunshine.

Smoking is an exceedingly acid-producing habit; and one of the major roles of calcium in

the body is to maintain a proper acid-alkaline balance. When one smokes, the calcium is

actual y drained from the bones and teeth to meet this need. Alcohol impairs calcium

absorption by affecting the liver's ability to activate vitamin D, which is important in the

metabolism of calcium.

Caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, soft drinks, hot chocolate, and many over-

the-counter drugs, causes more calcium to be excreted from the body than is normal(8).

The more salt (in particular, the more sodium) you take in, the more calcium you excrete.

Some antacids contain aluminum, which causes an increase in calcium excretion. It has

been clearly shown that exercise increases bone mass, while lack of exercise causes

bone loss. Since Vitamin D plays an important role in bone metabolism and the best

source of vitamin D is sunshine, it stands to reason that a lack of sunshine can lead to

osteoporosis.

When the problem of osteoporosis is studied world-wide, one is struck with the fact

that the highest incidence of osteoporosis is in countries where dairy products and calcium

supplements are consumed in the greatest quantities. The incidence of osteoporosis is

lowest in the countries where the least amount of dairy products are consumed, such as

the African countries. A number of studies have been done among the Bantu women of

Africa. They consume less than half the protein of Americans, and have a life-style

demanding large amounts of calcium (nursing up to ten children in a lifetime), yet

osteoporosis is almost unknown among them.

NATURAL SOLUTIONS



Let us cut down on the amount of protein we eat each day, and eat foods high in

natural calcium. For good health we must eat our food in as natural a state as possible

without taking man-made supplements.

PROSTATE GLAND

The prostate gland is red-brown in color and about the size of an English walnut. It is

located immediately under the bladder and in front of the rectum. It has three lobes, or

sections, enclosed side by side in a capsule. The urinary tube from the bladder passes

over the middle lobe; anything that happens there to swel the prostate- infection,

inflammation, cancer, etc., can enlarge these lobes and thus obstruct the flow of urine.

The prostate gland is the principal storage depot for seminal fluid. At each sexual

encounter the testicles provide over 200 mil ion sperm cel s. The function of the prostate is

to produce lubricating fluids and a special activating fluid in sexual activity that wil dilute

the sperm cel s. This seminal fluid is very high in zinc and also contains proteins,

enzymes, fats and sugars to nourish the sperm. It is alkaline to overcome the acidity of the

female tract and it is a very watery medium in which the sperm can swim toward the

female egg.

More zinc is found in the prostate gland than any other organ in the body. Zinc is a

trace mineral needed in only very smal amounts, but a deficiency can lead to major

medical problems. Zinc is found in high concentration in sperm and seminal fluid. The

brain also must have adequate zinc in order to keep the thoughts organized and balanced.

Excessive sexual practice may lead to depletion of zinc stores which may be fol owed by

both prostate disease and neurologic and mental disorders. Al nerve tissue is also

dependent for proper functioning on this trace mineral.

Each day the prostate produces from 1/10 to 2/5 of a teaspoon of seminal fluid.

During sexual arousal four to ten times that amount is produced. The prostate also

becomes congested with blood during arousal. An overactive sexual life can cause

chronic congestion in the prostate. Over a long period of lime, the prostate yields to the

constant pressure, enlarging to make room for the extra blood and seminal fluid.

There is a higher rate of cancer of the prostate among blacks â€” two times that of

Caucasians and four times that of Asians. Medical researchers and social scientists have

postulated that their often higher incidence of sexual activity may have led to this increase

in prostate problems. Male hormones increase with sexual excitation. The male hormone

testosterone breaks down to dihydrotestosterone. It is known that this substance, at least

in some laboratory animals, can cause the prostate to enlarge. The male hormones seem

to be a major cause of prostate enlargement as prostate enlargement rarely occurs

among eunuchs.

Enlargement of the prostate can be detected during a rectal examination (in which

the physician inserts a gloved finger into the rectum). If the doctor's examining finger

discovers a hard, button-size nodule in the otherwise soft, rubbery tissue, he considers it

cancer until he has proved otherwise. (Three times out of five, it is cancer).

Symptoms of an enlarged prostate usual y develop gradual y, as the enlarging

prostate compresses and distorts the urethra, (urinary tube). The flow of urine is

constricted, and there is difficulty starting urination and a weak stream. If the prostate

becomes too enlarged it wil actual y close off the urinary tube completely. In extreme

cases the prostate can become as large as a grapefruit. This enlargement can be either

cancerous or benign, but is usual y cancerous.

Cancer of the prostate is the second most common cancer in men. It sometimes

develops in middle age, but most often occurs in the elderly. Most cancers of the prostate

are very slow growing and usual y the person wil die of some other disease such as heart



162

attack, stroke, diabetes, etc., before they would die of prostate cancer. Recent studies

suggest that if every case of prostate cancer were treated in its earliest stages, more men

would die of surgical complications than the disease itself.



DIET ATTECTS THE PROSTATE

It is of interest that diet is not usual y mentioned as a cause of cancer of the

prostate. Yet it is cited as very important in a 20 year study done by Dr. Roland Phil ips at

Loma Linda, California. The study showed that fatal prostate cancer was more common

depending on the frequency with which meat, milk, eggs and cheese were used in the

diet. As each one of these food substances was added to the diet, the risk increased.

(Journal of Epidemiology 120(2):244) Cancer of the prostate is substantial y less among

Seventh-Day Adventists who use no coffee, alcohol and little or no animal products.

(Cancer Research, 43:2403, May 1983) Persons with any kind of prostate problems must

make sure they are drinking plenty of water so that the urine is almost clear. They should

also be on a diet of mostly raw foods.



FOOD THAT IRRITATE THE PROSTATE

Alcohol, animal products, caffeine, and spices should be eliminated from the diet of

those who have prostate problems. Animal products should be removed from the diet

because of the purine content which tends to increase the irritability of the bladder which

can indirectly affect the prostate gland. Caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, colas and

chocolate is an irritant to the urinary tract. It has been shown that just one cup of coffee

per day can cause 2 1/2 times greater incidence of cancer of the bladder. Spices also

have a tendency to irritate the prostate and bladder and should be removed from the diet.



NUTRITIONAL TREATMENT VS. CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT

The primary conventional treatments administered for enlarged prostate are

catheter drainage, estrogenic hormones, prostatic massage, and of course, closed

transurethral prostatic resection or, alternatively, removal of the prostate. Unfortunately,

doctors (and patients) have found surgery to be a radical remedy to this*" common

affliction, often resulting in complications. More and more patients are opting for a safer

cure.

Because of its nontraumatic, natural way the nutritional approach is preferable to

the more orthodox procedures.



For Prostate Enlargement Use Saw Palmetto Berries and Zinc



Enlarged prostate responds wel to the herb saw palmetto berries. Saw Palmetto is

a smal palm tree native to the West Indies and the Atlantic Coast of North America

extending from North Carolina to Florida. The trees are crowned with large, two to four-

foot high spiny-toothed leaves which form a circular, fan-shaped outline.

The plant's deep red-brown to black berries are wrinkled, oblong, and 0.5 to 1 - inch

in length with a diameter of 0.5 inch. They contain about 1.5 percent of a fruity smel ing oil

loaded with the sterol betasitosterol and its glu-coside, plus the saturated and unsaturated

fatty acids of captric, caprylic, caproic, lauric, palmitic, and ol eic. These fatty acids

comprise 63% of the oil, with the remaining portion consisting of their ethyl esters and the

mentioned sterols. Also present are carotenes, lipase, tannins and sugars.

Serenoa Repens (Saw Palmetto berries) has been found to be extremely effective

in treating prostate enlargement, according to a study by Dr. G. Champault published in

the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. Serenoa works by countering the effect of



163

decreased testosterone in your system, (which al ows other hormones, including DHT, to

increase the size of the prostate.) Dr. C. Sultan, in a study published in the Journal of

Steroid Biochemistry, found that Serenoa contains sterol like compounds that inhibit the

formation of DHT. This nutrient comes from a berry produced by a palm species common

to the Southeast United States. American Indians felt it was a cure for prostate problems.

European scientists have confirmed these effects in 12 major scientific studies done over

the past twenty years.

Prostate disorders are much more common in developed countries, such as the

United States, than in Third World countries. There are a few reasons why. The primary

one is that the majority of American meals are overcooked or over processed. The

processing of food destroys a good portion, if not al , of one of the most important

nutrients used by the prostate gland - zinc.



The Prostate Needs 10 Times More Zinc Than Any Other Organ



Most of the zinc in food is lost in processing, or never exists in a substantial amount

due to nutrient poor soil. Zinc is not normal y replaced in the soil when chemical fertilizers

are used. The world famous founder of the free radical theory of aging, Dr. Denham

Harman, M.D., Ph.D. professor emeritus of the University of Nebraska School of Medicine,

stated, "Some 90% of the population consumes diets deficient in zinc."

The prostate uses 10 times more of this nutrient than any other organ in the body.

As the production of testosterone declines, an enzyme stimulates the production of DHT

and other hormones which cause enlargement. Many scientists have confirmed that when

sufficient zinc is present, it helps prevent that enzyme from doing its damage.



Dr. M. S. Fahin and Dr. H. A. Essa published a clinical study in a government

medical journal showing that treatment with zinc reduces prostate enlargement. Dr.

Geoffrey Crisholin and Dr. Alan Leake reported in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry that

zinc prevents the hormonal actions that causes prostate enlargement. In total, fifteen

prominent research scientists published confirming reports that sufficient zinc is of vital

necessity for having a healthy prostate gland. Significant quantities of zinc are found in

brewerâ€™s yeast, lima beans, pecans, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and soybeans.

Smal er amounts of zinc are found in legumes and whole grains.



Hydrotherapy and Massage Will Help Reduce the Enlarged Prostate Gland



Hot and cold sitz baths alternating, using 3 minutes hot and one minute cold, are

beneficial for an enlarged prostate gland. You always start with the hot and end with the

cold. This combination can be done from 3 to 5 times, and should be done once or twice a

day. Massage of the prostate (through the rectum) can help reduce the swel ing and help

in the recovery of an enlarged prostate.

Prostate problems very rarely occur before the age of 30. At the age of 50 there wil

be a 25 percent chance of an enlarged prostate. At the age of 60 about half of al men wil

have developed some enlargement of the prostate. At the age of 80 almost al men wil

have some enlargement.



PROSTATE CANCER FACTS



Despite a major hoopla over the new Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test,

concurrent biopsies and early aggressive treatment for prostate cancer, the best treatment

for most men is no treatment at all. Here are the facts:



164



â€¢ Most cases of cancer of the prostate are so slow growing that they rarely become

life threatening.

â€¢ For men who are under 70, early detection and radical treatment may increase life

by less than one year, but complications are too severe to warrant prostatectomy

(removal of the prostate).

â€¢ Approximately one in 380 men with prostate cancer wil die of the disease.

â€¢ In a major study from Sweden, men of median age 72 were fol owed over ten

years. Al had prostate cancer. After ten years, the cancer death rate was 8.5% for

those men who received no treatment. The cancer death rate for American men

who are treated aggressively (PSA testing, drugs and prostatectomy) is 15%.
