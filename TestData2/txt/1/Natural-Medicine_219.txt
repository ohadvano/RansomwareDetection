
The plant's deep red-brown to black berries are wrinkled, oblong, and 0.5 to 1 - inch

in length with a diameter of 0.5 inch. They contain about 1.5 percent of a fruity smel ing oil

loaded with the sterol betasitosterol and its glu-coside, plus the saturated and unsaturated

fatty acids of captric, caprylic, caproic, lauric, palmitic, and ol eic. These fatty acids

comprise 63% of the oil, with the remaining portion consisting of their ethyl esters and the

mentioned sterols. Also present are carotenes, lipase, tannins and sugars.

Serenoa Repens (Saw Palmetto berries) has been found to be extremely effective

in treating prostate enlargement, according to a study by Dr. G. Champault published in

the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. Serenoa works by countering the effect of



163

decreased testosterone in your system, (which al ows other hormones, including DHT, to

increase the size of the prostate.) Dr. C. Sultan, in a study published in the Journal of

Steroid Biochemistry, found that Serenoa contains sterol like compounds that inhibit the

formation of DHT. This nutrient comes from a berry produced by a palm species common

to the Southeast United States. American Indians felt it was a cure for prostate problems.

European scientists have confirmed these effects in 12 major scientific studies done over

the past twenty years.

Prostate disorders are much more common in developed countries, such as the

United States, than in Third World countries. There are a few reasons why. The primary

one is that the majority of American meals are overcooked or over processed. The

processing of food destroys a good portion, if not al , of one of the most important

nutrients used by the prostate gland - zinc.



The Prostate Needs 10 Times More Zinc Than Any Other Organ



Most of the zinc in food is lost in processing, or never exists in a substantial amount

due to nutrient poor soil. Zinc is not normal y replaced in the soil when chemical fertilizers

are used. The world famous founder of the free radical theory of aging, Dr. Denham

Harman, M.D., Ph.D. professor emeritus of the University of Nebraska School of Medicine,

stated, "Some 90% of the population consumes diets deficient in zinc."

The prostate uses 10 times more of this nutrient than any other organ in the body.

As the production of testosterone declines, an enzyme stimulates the production of DHT

and other hormones which cause enlargement. Many scientists have confirmed that when

sufficient zinc is present, it helps prevent that enzyme from doing its damage.



Dr. M. S. Fahin and Dr. H. A. Essa published a clinical study in a government

medical journal showing that treatment with zinc reduces prostate enlargement. Dr.

Geoffrey Crisholin and Dr. Alan Leake reported in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry that

zinc prevents the hormonal actions that causes prostate enlargement. In total, fifteen

prominent research scientists published confirming reports that sufficient zinc is of vital

necessity for having a healthy prostate gland. Significant quantities of zinc are found in

brewerâ€™s yeast, lima beans, pecans, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and soybeans.

Smal er amounts of zinc are found in legumes and whole grains.



Hydrotherapy and Massage Will Help Reduce the Enlarged Prostate Gland



Hot and cold sitz baths alternating, using 3 minutes hot and one minute cold, are

beneficial for an enlarged prostate gland. You always start with the hot and end with the

cold. This combination can be done from 3 to 5 times, and should be done once or twice a

day. Massage of the prostate (through the rectum) can help reduce the swel ing and help

in the recovery of an enlarged prostate.

Prostate problems very rarely occur before the age of 30. At the age of 50 there wil

be a 25 percent chance of an enlarged prostate. At the age of 60 about half of al men wil

have developed some enlargement of the prostate. At the age of 80 almost al men wil

have some enlargement.



PROSTATE CANCER FACTS



Despite a major hoopla over the new Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test,

concurrent biopsies and early aggressive treatment for prostate cancer, the best treatment

for most men is no treatment at all. Here are the facts:



164



â€¢ Most cases of cancer of the prostate are so slow growing that they rarely become

life threatening.

â€¢ For men who are under 70, early detection and radical treatment may increase life

by less than one year, but complications are too severe to warrant prostatectomy

(removal of the prostate).

â€¢ Approximately one in 380 men with prostate cancer wil die of the disease.

â€¢ In a major study from Sweden, men of median age 72 were fol owed over ten

years. Al had prostate cancer. After ten years, the cancer death rate was 8.5% for

those men who received no treatment. The cancer death rate for American men

who are treated aggressively (PSA testing, drugs and prostatectomy) is 15%.

â€¢ The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute have long

advocated yearly rectal exams for men over 40. This screening is now being

escalated to recommendation for PSA blood test for men over 50. Both these tests

are absolutely meaningless, given the new results of testing. There is no reason for

early prostate cancer when the optimum treatment is no treatment at al .

â€¢ The PSA test is a poor test. More than one-third of al men with prostate cancer wil

have normal PSA test. The rate of positive test for men with no cancer is even

higher.

â€¢ The positive PSA tests foster lots of biopsies to test further for prostate cancer.

When biopsies are positive, many if not most doctors wil opt for a radical

prostatectomy. The risks of this procedure are severe. Within a month, 8% of men

wil suffer cardiovascular complications and 2% wil die. Impotence, bladder

problems and bowel obstruction are not uncommon.

â€¢ Dr. Frank Hinman, Jr. of the University of California, San Francisco School of

Medicine, observes that mass screening of prostate cancer in elderly men may

have more risks than benefits.



While 2.5% of men die of prostate cancer, the greatest proportion of men screened

for prostate cancer may be subjected to unnecessary stress and anxiety, expensive

diagnostic testing and unnecessary treatment. (Internal Medicine News 24(21)52,

November 1-14, 1991)

SUGAR AND HONEY



In 1882, the average American ate 2 teaspoons of sugar per day. In 1870, it was 11

teaspoons per day. In 1980, we consumed 35 teaspoons of sugar per day; and now the

average is over 42 teaspoons per day. (See chart on Sugar Content of some popular

foods).



WHAT IS SUGAR?

Sugar is a carbohydrate that occurs natural y in various forms in al living things. In

its natural form, sugar, as found in the sugar cane or sugar beet, is combined with a large

amount of fiber, and also contains iron, potassium, calcium, B vitamins, etc.. These

nutrients are needed to digest the sugar that is in the sugar beet or sugar cane, However

white sugar, as we get it today, has been robbed of almost 100% of these nutrients. White

sugar is so pure and refined that it basical y has nothing in it but 'empty calories'.

Concentrated, pure sugar is a drug, unrelated to anything that occurs natural y, and

is very harmful to your body. According to John Yudlin, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Nutririon

at London University, "If only a smal fraction of what is known about the effects of sugar

was revealed in relation to any other food additive, that material would be promptly

banned".

Sugar throws off the calcium-phosphorous balance, and disrupts the entire

important phase of your body machinery. Because refined sugar has been robbed of the B

vitamins that are necessary for its assimilation by the body, it latches on to these wherever

it finds them - namely, in your digestive tract, so that the person who eats refined sugar is

bound to be short on the B vitamins. Result? Nervousness, skin troubles, digestive

trouble, and a host of other disorders which lead to much more serious problems later on.

The more sugar you eat, the lower your body's resistance to disease becomes. To

have good health we must have a strong immune system. Sugar lowers our body's

immune system, making it weak instead of strong. In our body we have white blood cel s,

which are cal ed warrior cel s. These attack and destroy bacteria. However, when we eat

refined sugar, it causes our white blood cel s to become sluggish, causing them to lose

their ability to destroy as many bacteria.

In a healthy body, where no refined sugar is eaten, one white blood cel can destroy

14 bacteria. If a person then eats 12 teaspoons of sugar (a 12 oz. bottle of Cola has 10

teaspoons), one of their white blood cel s wil only be able to destroy 5.5 bacteria. If a

person eats 24 teaspoons of sugar (a banana split has 25 teaspoons of sugar), one of

their white blood cel s wil only be able to destroy 1 bacteria. This weakening effect on the

white blood cel usual y lasts for approximately 5 hours. To keep our body's immune

system strong, we must leave sugar alone.



Refined sugar drains out the mineral salts of the blood, bones, and tissues. It

causes hyperactivity and dental caries. It causes obesity, diabetes, low blood sugar, high

blood pressure, duodenal ulcers, fatty livers, coronary and vascular disease, gout,

dermatitis, and cancer. According to the American Journal of Hypertension (3:560-562,

1990), sucrose (sugar) intake may increase the blood pressure. Other studies have

indicated that the intake of refined carbohydrates produces an increase in the blood

pressure.

WHAT ABOUT HONEY?



Honey is not a disaccharide like sugar; it is a

monosaccharide which does not over-stimulate the

pancreas. Sugar, which comes from beets or cane, is

sucrose, a disaccharide, which over-stimulates the

pancreas. Sugar also must undergo digestion, a process

that changes it into simple sugar; whereas, honey is pre-

digested and takes a load of work off the stomach and

pancreas.



Honey is refined by the bees, whereas sugar is

refined by man under less than ideal conditions, for man is

not as careful or as diligent as the honey bee. Bees have to

col ect nectar from nearly two mil ion flower blossoms to

produce just one pound of honey. Bees are faithful and

diligent in their work of making honey. Of course, pure

organic raw honey is better than what you buy at the local



167

grocery store. Raw honey wil in a short time crystal ize because it has not been heated to

a high temperature and had al the enzymes destroyed. Honey also has more vitamins

and minerals than sugar. (See chart for comparison)

America has become addicted to sugar. The average per person consumption in

the U.S. is almost 135 pounds a year! Americans may be thought of as meat and potato

eaters, but the average per person consumption of red meat is only 111 pounds per year,

and of potatoes only 123 pounds per year.

Increasingly more Americans, however, are becoming aware of the danger in sugar

consumption; and for some time now, the public has been exploring sweet alternatives.

How safe are these artificial sweeteners? We are al familiar with the fact that some of

these artificial sweeteners have been associated with cancer. I wil merely give current

information on one of these sweeteners.



SWEETENER LINKED TO CONFUSION AND MEMORY LOSS



Aspartame, the artificial sweetener widely used in diet soda and food, may cause

confusion and memory loss in some people. This finding came from a study of 551 people

who had severe reactions to aspartame, which is marketed under the brand name of

NutraSweet. HJ. Roberts, director of the Palm Beach Institute for Medical Research in

Florida, found that 157 of the participants had major problems. Eleven lost vision in one or

both eyes; one-third suffered from severe dizziness; half reported severe headaches. One

18 year-old male, who drank about two quarts of aspartame-sweetened diet soda daily,

could not find his way home in his own neighborhood. Severe reactions to the sweetener

occurred three times more often in women. Although the Food and Drug Administration

has received hundreds of complaints about aspartame from consumers, no adequate

studies have been conducted. (New Scientist, 2/18/88).



WHAT CAN WE USE THEN INSTEAD OF SUGAR?

Use natural sugar just as the Good Lord put it in the food, such as fresh peaches,

strawberries, cherries, watermelon, etc. A more concentrated natural sugar would be

found in dates, figs, raisins, dried fruits, honey, etc.

TESTIMONIALS TO

NATURAL HEALTH LIFESTYLE



At every session of our lifestyle center we were thril ed to see lives changed to the

glory of God; we saw individuals make an about face in their lifestyle, and begin their

journey on the path of abundant health and happiness. At the end of every session our

guests testified to the value of our program in their lives. Many of them write testimonials

which are published in our newsletters. The fol owing stories are about some of these

guests who have given permission to print their stories. However, to protect their privacy,

the names have been changed.



FORMER LIFESTYLE GUEST DISCONTINUES HIS DAILY 125 MG. OF

MORPHINE.



Len Dyer (not his real name) and his wife attended our 26- day lifestyle session.

Len came to us with an advanced stage of prostate cancer. In the past, Len had

undergone surgery, radiation and chemotherapy and there was nothing more the doctors

could do except give him morphine for the pain. For the past year Len had been taking

125 mg. of morphine daily. Len's wife had contacted me by phone and I had started Len

on our program while he was at home as we couldn't take him immediately.

With the skil ful use of God's eight natural remedies of fresh air, pure soft water,

natural food, rest, exercise, sunshine, temperance, and trust in God, Len was able to

completely discontinue his morphine. Slowly his strength and digestion improved and

thoughts became clearer. He stil had some bad days but overal he was improving.

After his stay here, he went home looking and feeling much better. We I decided to

cal him and see how he was doing. It had been over six weeks since we had talked to

him. He is stil not using any morphine and is slowly recovering with occasional bad days.

Len is thankful he had the opportunity to attend one of our sessions and learn the natural

ways to good health.



RONALD'S STORY



Ronald Flood (not his real name) from Puerto Rico attended our 26-day lifestyle

session. After hearing about our program from a friend who was a previous client. Ronald

was a successful businessman and the owner of 10 jewelry stores; but now at the age of

48, major health problems brought him seeking relief to our center.

Until 11/2 years ago, Ronald had been a heavy drinker. He had undergone a gal

bladder operation, and was having liver problems. He was retaining fluid, especial y in his

feet. His arms and legs would fal asleep at night; and he had swel ing of the lymph glands

in his neck. Ronald also had real problems with digestion, having only two or three bowel

movements a week. He always felt tired, and realized he needed help.

Ronald was accustomed to eating lots of meat, and drinking lots of milk, coffee,

colas, and tea; but he readily accepted his new pure vegetarian diet. This diet, high in



169

fresh fruits and vegetables, permitted no meats, milk, eggs, sugar, oil, baking powder, or

soda, preservatives, or chemicals.

At the end of the 26 day session, Ronald felt like a new man. He felt so good, and

had so much energy, that during his stay he walked 65 1/2 miles, biked 10 miles, and

helped us here with mowing the lawn, washing windows, etc. His arms and legs no longer

fel asleep at night; and he was no longer retaining fluid. The swel ing in his lymph glands

was gone, and his digestion problems were over, He was having two bowel movements

daily now instead of the previous two or three a week. He lost 91/2 pounds, and he had a

blood pressure reading of 98/58, and a pulse of 68.

Before leaving us, Ronald told us that he was going to sel his jewelry stores, and

possibly open up a health food store or bakery; he wanted to share with others how to

become healthy.



ARTYâ€™S STORY



The phone rang in the office, and we hurried to answer it. We were between

sessions and already almost booked to capacity. This time the cal er was a woman from

overseas would I have space for her husband who was desperately il ? As we talked with

her we learned that he had been diagnosed with cancer and was very discouraged. We

assured her that there was space, and thus Artie and his wife Joan (not their regular

names) became a part of our next family group here at the center.

Through other cal s from friends of Arty's who had attended our lifestyle sessions

we learned a little more about him. Arty, we were told, used to be a robust, active man

with a cheery disposition and an outgoing personality. Diagnosed with cancer, he had

recently returned from attending a different lifestyle center here in the United States. He

was fol owing a good health plan, and should be improving, yet he seemed instead to be

getting worse. His friends said that he was losing weight at an alarming rate.

Our first meeting with Artie and his wife confirmed what our cal ers had said. Artie

was very depressed; he seemed fearful, discouraged, and uncertain about the program he

was fol owing. We assured him that the program was accurate, and proceeded to counsel

him and give him therapy. He immediately joined our other session guests in our program

of exercise and diet as described throughout the pages of this book. Artie and his wife left

our center different people: Artie had gained weight; his cheery smile had returned; his

painful symptoms had disappeared; and he was testifying to the goodness of God. One

year later, he is stil improving, and has returned to his usual program of activity, faithful y

fol owing the natural lifestyle program.

VACCINATIONS



Should we take vaccinations? The answer is no! Vaccinations are not a natural

way to stay healthy. Vaccinations are a disease-producing process, which results in injury

to the bodyÅ› organs, nervous system, blood stream, etc. The immunization program has

been based on PasteurÅ› germ theory. It is frequently overlooked that Pasteur changed

his thinking before his death.



VACCINATIONS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE



Vaccine making is an ever changing and highly experimental process. Even the

vaccine manufactures admit that vaccines are unpredictable in their effects, unstable in

nature, and are unreliable in use, and never safe. Consequently, no one real y knows just

what is being shot into his or her arm, and what it wil do. One shot could possibly cause

sudden death, paralysis, lockjaw, brain-damage, or in some cases there may be no

reaction at al for months or years. The one administering the shot never tel s you what is

in the vaccine. In fact, many doctors do not even know what chemicals, drugs or other

dangerous substances are in the vaccine serums. Lets take a close look at just four of the

many vaccines that are being used today.



SMALL POX VACCINE



â€œA calf is tied down to an operating table, the stomach is shaved from twelve to

fifteen inches square and about one hundred incisions are made. Into these incisions one

drop of glycerinated lymph, (a culture of smal pox passed through a solution of glycerine)

is al owed to drop in and is thoroughly rubbed in. Fever sets in, and the animal becomes

exceedingly sick. In a few days the vesicles appear, the scabs form, and the elimination

of impurities of various kinds from the blood of the calf begins in the form of pus, which is

thrown out of the blood into the vesicles. At the end of six days the process of elimination

has proceeded so far that the vesicles are ful of putrid cel s, etc., and a scab has formed

over the reservoir of disease. The calf is once more bound and laid upon the operating

table. The inoculated area is washed with water and each vesicle is clasped with clamps

separately. The crust is careful y scrapped with the edge of a steel instrument and the

dead skin, lymph, poisonous pus and blood are exuded and are transferred to a smal

crucible.



To this toxic mass of putrid matter is added an equal measure of glycerine, and the

mass is then thoroughly stirred and mixed by a smal electric motor. As soon as it is

rendered homogeneous, it is placed in another crucible and passed through a very fine
