“Did you really mean what you said to Silver that you care for me?”
There's a long pause before he finally speaks. “I did mean it. Every single word.”
I face him and look into his eyes. “You're not lying to me, are you? I've had enough of people lying to me.”
He smiles gently. “I told you before that I'd never lie to you. All I'll ever give you is the truth.”
“Bullshit.” I say just as I attempt to get off the couch but stop when Ryder puts his hand on my hip.
He doesn't place me next to him but instead pulls me to sit on top of him with my legs on either side of his thighs.
My heart is pounding inside my chest just as he places his hands on my hips.
Why am I still sitting on him eagerly waiting for what he's about to do next?
He leans closer to me and when I think he's going to kiss me, I feel the brush of his lips against my ear. “Did you just accuse me of lying?”
