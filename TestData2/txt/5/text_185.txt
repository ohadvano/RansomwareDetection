“Is that supposed to make me feel better?”
A second ticks by when Ryder sighs. “Your mom's home. I better leave before she thinks her daughter's up to no good.”
The bright lights of the headlights shine on Ryder's form as my mother turns into the driveway.
I get out of the bed, approach Ryder and place my hand on his arm. “I'll be there.”
He looks at my hand wrapped around his arm, moves to look at me then nods. “Good.”
I drop my hand from his arm as he moves to open my window when I remember the conversation we had earlier, I call his name but he doesn't turn around.
“About tonight, I just want you to know that I don't judge you for what you did.”
He turns to face me with his piercing green eyes. “Which part? The one where I beat the shit out of your friend or the fact that you caught me kissing Silver?”
I'm taken aback and look at Ryder with a frown. “I don't judge you for kissing her.”
