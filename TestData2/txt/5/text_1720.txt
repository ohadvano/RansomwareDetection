He puts up both of his hands. “I just wanted to apologise about last night.”
“Which part do you want to apologise for? And you're apologising to me a lot lately.”
“I just want to get along with you Alice. Is that so hard to believe?”
“Look, I tried explaining to you about what happened that night, but you decided to cut me off. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's your fault that you didn't get what you wanted. So, for that, you can piss off.”
“Who's the new guy?” I look into his eyes but I can't make out his expression.
“He's new to the school.”
Ryder puts his hands in his pockets. “I saw him walking out with you.”
“What's that got to do with you?”
He clenches his jaw. “I'm not gonna leave you alone. You're gonna need me for the next change, and whenever that is, I'm gonna make sure that I'm there to help you. I don't care what you say, but I'll be there to make sure that you survive.”
