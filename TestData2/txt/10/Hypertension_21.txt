The chart above was gathered from a number of sources. There is a difference between what is alkalizing and what is acidifying depending on source, as various methods are used to determine this. Some researchers use the alkaline content of a food; others try to determine the effect on the body â€“ citrus fruit on the surface appears to be acidic for example, but has a neutralizing affect when consumed; other researchers have come up with a number, as in the chart above, in which they use mineral content to determine the rating.

Use your good judgment on determining which acidic foods to eat. For instance, Salmon, tuna and even sardines provide Omega fatty acids which are important to health. Donâ€™t cut these out of your diet because of the acidifying ratings. Use reason. I eat hamburgers and other meats because I like them, but I donâ€™t do it every day or in large quantities. I want to keep my pancreas healthy.

About pH: pH is recorded on a level from 0 to 14, with 0 to 6.9 being acidic, 7 neutral and 7.1 to 14 alkaline. The human body should be around 7.35 to 7.5 for optimal health. When we eat foods, the pancreas works to turn the digested particles alkaline as they enter the blood stream. It takes 750,000 times the effort to turn a soda with a pH 2 to a pH 7.5 as it does to change a pH 7 food to pH 7.5. Each level takes 10 times the effort.

GOD PROVIDED EVERYTHING WE NEED FOR HEALTH

God provided us with awesome bodies capable of healing themselves and resisting tremendous strains. He provided all the foods we need to keep our bodies healthy. He even left clue in some of the foods to let us know they were especially good for certain organs and parts of the body. The chart below shows some examples.

A sliced Carrot looks like the human eye. The pupil, iris and radiating lines look just like the human eye - and science now shows carrots greatly enhance blood flow to and function of the eyes.

A Tomato has four chambers and is red. The heart has four chambers and is red. All of the research shows tomatoes are loaded with lycopine and are indeed pure heart and blood food.

Grapes hang in a cluster that has the shape of the heart. Each grape looks like a blood cell and all of the research today shows grapes are also profound heart and blood vitalizing food.

A Walnut looks like a little brain, a left and right hemisphere, upper cerebrums and lower cerebellums. Even the wrinkles or folds on the nut are just like the neo-cortex. We now know walnuts help develop more than three (3) dozen neuron-transmitters for brain function.

47

Kidney Beans actually heal and help maintain kidney function and they look exactly like the human kidneys.

Celery, Bok Choy, Rhubarb and many more look just like bones. These foods specifically target bone strength. Bones are 23% sodium and these foods are 23% sodium. If you don't have enough sodium in your diet, the body pulls it from the bones, thus making them weak. These foods replenish the skeletal needs of the body.

Avocadoes, Eggplant and Pears target the health and function of the womb and cervix of the female - they look just like these organs. Today's research shows that when a woman eats one avocado a week, it balances hormones, sheds unwanted birth weight, and prevents cervical cancers. And how profound is this? It takes exactly nine (9) months to grow an avocado from blossom to ripened fruit. There are over 14,000 photolytic chemical constituents of nutrition in each one of these foods (modern science has only studied and named about 141 of them).

Figs are full of seeds and hang in twos when they grow. Figs increase the mobility of male sperm and increase the numbers of Sperm as well to overcome male sterility.

Sweet Potatoes look like the pancreas and actually balance the glycemic index of diabetics.

Olives assist the health and function of the ovaries.

48

Oranges, Grapefruits, and other Citrus fruits look just like the mammary glands of the female and actually assist the health of the breasts and the movement of lymph in and out of the breasts.

Onions look like the body's cells. Today's research shows onions help clear waste materials from all of the body cells. They even produce tears which wash the epithelial layers of the eyes. A working companion, Garlic, also helps eliminate waste materials and dangerous free radicals from the body

There are many other delicious fruits and vegetables God has provided for us all the things we need for a healthy body. One example is honey, often called the perfect food because of the many healing properties associated with it. Salt water, while we canâ€™t drink it, has many healing properties for our outside bodies; a salt water bath, for instance, is very soothing and healing for sore muscles. Salt water is also a great source for iodine. Everything we need was provided long before we were ever created.

Researchers are just beginning to uncover that all we needed was here all along. Even the formulas for our drugs begin from foods that have healing properties.
