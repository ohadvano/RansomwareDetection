GOD PROVIDED EVERYTHING WE NEED FOR HEALTH

God provided us with awesome bodies capable of healing themselves and resisting tremendous strains. He provided all the foods we need to keep our bodies healthy. He even left clue in some of the foods to let us know they were especially good for certain organs and parts of the body. The chart below shows some examples.

A sliced Carrot looks like the human eye. The pupil, iris and radiating lines look just like the human eye - and science now shows carrots greatly enhance blood flow to and function of the eyes.

A Tomato has four chambers and is red. The heart has four chambers and is red. All of the research shows tomatoes are loaded with lycopine and are indeed pure heart and blood food.

Grapes hang in a cluster that has the shape of the heart. Each grape looks like a blood cell and all of the research today shows grapes are also profound heart and blood vitalizing food.

A Walnut looks like a little brain, a left and right hemisphere, upper cerebrums and lower cerebellums. Even the wrinkles or folds on the nut are just like the neo-cortex. We now know walnuts help develop more than three (3) dozen neuron-transmitters for brain function.

47

Kidney Beans actually heal and help maintain kidney function and they look exactly like the human kidneys.

Celery, Bok Choy, Rhubarb and many more look just like bones. These foods specifically target bone strength. Bones are 23% sodium and these foods are 23% sodium. If you don't have enough sodium in your diet, the body pulls it from the bones, thus making them weak. These foods replenish the skeletal needs of the body.

Avocadoes, Eggplant and Pears target the health and function of the womb and cervix of the female - they look just like these organs. Today's research shows that when a woman eats one avocado a week, it balances hormones, sheds unwanted birth weight, and prevents cervical cancers. And how profound is this? It takes exactly nine (9) months to grow an avocado from blossom to ripened fruit. There are over 14,000 photolytic chemical constituents of nutrition in each one of these foods (modern science has only studied and named about 141 of them).

Figs are full of seeds and hang in twos when they grow. Figs increase the mobility of male sperm and increase the numbers of Sperm as well to overcome male sterility.

Sweet Potatoes look like the pancreas and actually balance the glycemic index of diabetics.

Olives assist the health and function of the ovaries.

48

Oranges, Grapefruits, and other Citrus fruits look just like the mammary glands of the female and actually assist the health of the breasts and the movement of lymph in and out of the breasts.

Onions look like the body's cells. Today's research shows onions help clear waste materials from all of the body cells. They even produce tears which wash the epithelial layers of the eyes. A working companion, Garlic, also helps eliminate waste materials and dangerous free radicals from the body

There are many other delicious fruits and vegetables God has provided for us all the things we need for a healthy body. One example is honey, often called the perfect food because of the many healing properties associated with it. Salt water, while we canâ€™t drink it, has many healing properties for our outside bodies; a salt water bath, for instance, is very soothing and healing for sore muscles. Salt water is also a great source for iodine. Everything we need was provided long before we were ever created.

Researchers are just beginning to uncover that all we needed was here all along. Even the formulas for our drugs begin from foods that have healing properties.

RECIPES

There are many recipes for vegetarian and plant-based meals. I have included a couple of web links below. For the first 30 days of my pH cleaning diet I simply adjusted recipes to fit my needs. If you refer back to http://ThingsYouWantToKnow.com/html/how.html I will begin posting recipes. If you would like to share your recipes, simply email me at the site.

http://allrecipes.com/Recipes/Everyday-Cooking/Vegetarian/Main.aspx - This site includes use of oils, eggs, milk, fish, etc. They have a portion function which allows you to enter portions desired, which then adjusts the recipe for you accordingly. They have over 2,000 recipes. I modified ingredients for my meals, especially during the first 30 days.

http://www.vegetariansrecipes.org/ - There is a good selection of recipes at this site.

http://www.vegcooking.com/ - This site is a vegan recipe site which avoids all products that came from an animal. There are some really good recipes here.

CREDITS

Information was gathered from multiple websites, articles, research papers, talking to doctors, the American Diabetes Association and personal experience. The book Reverse

Diabetes Now had a definite influence as regards information and format. Information was verified for accuracy before I began a pH balancing program and again before including in this book. I highly recommend the above book. It contains far more background information with references.

INTRODUCTION

Like many people I thought I could abuse my body by eating what I wanted, when I wanted and as much as I wanted. It is amazing how you can be so busy with life that you let life pass you by. At one point I woke up and realized I weighed in at 335 pounds, so I dieted and exercised my way to 225 pounds. A few years later I found myself back up to 365 pounds. I again started exercising semi-regularly, cut out sodas and started eating healthier, but not healthy. I dropped 80 pounds over the course of around a year. Then I had a stroke.

Talk about a life-changing wake-up call. The stroke affected my right side â€“ speech, chewing, bowels, loss of right arm and leg function, and many inner body functions. I felt like my life was nothing more than surviving day to day, sleeping and eating. Using the restroom, if I could make it in time, was like potty training all over again. I could only sit for a short time before needing to lie down and could not fix my own meals or even get a glass of water. Sleeping more than an hour at a time was a great blessing. As stubborn as I am, I tried to push myself. Some things leave you helpless. No matter how much you try it is out of your control. The simple fact is I had lost my strength, much of my movement and essentially my freedom and independence.

Two years have gone by since the stroke occurred. I thank God for what I can do. Iâ€™ve come a long way, but have further to go to make a full recovery.

When I was in the hospital I was informed that I was diabetic, had high cholesterol and high blood pressure (208/120). They immediately put me on medication and quickly told me what I should and shouldnâ€™t eat. Interestingly, the meals they fed me didnâ€™t match their advice. After 5 days at the hospital, losing more abilities than when I arrived, they finally released me over threats I would simply check myself out. My first visit with a doctor outside the hospital, while writing slip after slip of prescription drugs, the doctor asked how I felt having to take medications the rest of my life.

Shocked, I asked what he meant. He basically replied that it was unlikely I would ever totally control my high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and that diabetes would be with me for the rest of my life. I told him that he better get ready to start reducing my prescription medications, because I wouldnâ€™t be on them forever. I knew it was possible to overcome any adversity. Eating properly and exercising to the best of my limited ability, I began to show him that I was serious. I admit it was very slow going.

Ten months later I had the opportunity to participate in a stroke study at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with the Physical Therapy masters students. With their help, I was eating well and walking 40 minutes twice a day. My bad cholesterol became a thing of the past, but the high blood pressure and diabetes still plagued me and my good cholesterol was too low.

Nobody I knew in medicine had an answer. My college degree is in Sports Medicine. I was pre-med at one time and studied molecular biology, physiology and other medical courses. I aced through the classes. But I didnâ€™t know the answer and none of my professors or doctors had an answer. I spent a good nine months spending much of my time looking at studies, research, medical information and my blood test results. I hadnâ€™t lost an ounce in over a year, even with exercise and a reduced calorie diet. That should have done it. I was just tired of the answer that the stroke had affected minor systems in my body that were preventing me from full recovery and weight loss.

I came across a book that said I could cure my diabetes. I saved up, bought it, reviewed it, researched every study mentioned, studied more and then finally tried a version of it that I could live with. Within 1Â½ months of trying my cure for diabetes program my good cholesterol had risen, my blood pressure was normal at 120/70 (thatâ€™s less than my best physical peak when I was young) and I did not need any medicine for diabetes. I gained about 15 pounds when I first started the diet, and then dropped weight for a net loss of 10 pounds â€“ I gained muscle and bone density and flushed away fat. The doctor couldnâ€™t believe it.

I recommend following this program for 90 days and then making a lifetime commitment to eating healthy. I actually stopped after I didnâ€™t need any more medication. I havenâ€™t gained any weight, but I havenâ€™t lost any either, and my blood work continues to show I am healthy. Since starting to write this book to share with all the people asking me what I did, I have started strictly following my own advice again and dropped 5 pounds the first week. Maybe this is the true weight loss answer weâ€™ve all been looking forward to finding.

This book has been written for all those people who have been asking me for information on how I accomplished curing my diseases so quickly. That statement kind of bothers me. I did not heal myself. God gave me a body that was wondrously and fearfully made that was able to heal because I followed the rules He originally set forth for healthy bodies. You can follow some simple steps I have tried to set out here so that your body can heal according to the marvelous work God performed in making you.

I have written background information on pH balances, nutrition, oxygen, water, etc to give you the reasons for what I did and why you should do something similar. I have included charts and tables in the back to help also. I hope the information is written so it is easily understood and helps you. I have experienced the affects firsthand and know it works.
