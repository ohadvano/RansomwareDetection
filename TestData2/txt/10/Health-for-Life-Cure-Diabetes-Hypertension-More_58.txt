MEGA VITAMIN THERAPY/VISION LOSS

Three adult males, given massive doses of nicotinic acid for treatment of high

cholesterol, suffered from loss of central vision. Nicotinic acid may induce retention of fluid

and swel ing in the eye leading to loss of vision. After the nicotinic acid was discontinued,

some improvement in vision occurred.



CALCIUM/BONE STRENGTH

Large doses of calcium may decrease bone strength instead of strengthening them.

Large calcium supplements alter the ratio, and may produce weakening, of the bones.

High calcium levels also interfere with Vitamin K function, and may lead to internal

bleeding.

Dr. Walter Mertz of the Human Nutrition Research Center of the United States

Department of Agriculture in Beltsvil e, Maryland, observed that the absorption of iron and

zinc is blocked by calcium supplements.



CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS/ARTHRITIS

Calcium supplements may induce symptoms of arthritis in sensitive patients. A 67

year old woman developed pain, swel ing, and redness in her right thumb after she began

taking calcium supplements. Symptoms cleared within about two weeks after the calcium

supplement was discontinued. She was later started on Os-Cal as a calcium supplement,

and within two weeks the symptoms recurred, and cleared only after the cessation of the

calcium intake. Some people may be very sensitive to calcium supplements.



VITAMIN A/CANCER RISK

Because special studies have suggested that Vitamin A is protective against

cancer, some people are recommending supplements. Suzanne T. Orr, Ph.D., of the

Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine of the University of Maryland

School of Medicine in Baltimore, observes that Vitamin A may be easily obtained by



180

dietary sources of provitamin A, found in many vegetables and fruits. ONE SERVING of

carrot, cantaloupe, cabbage, celery, turnip greens, sweet potato, kale, mango or many

other natural foods is sufficient to provide the RDA. ( Clinical Nutrition 4:138-142, 1985).



VITAMIN C/COMMON COLD

Vitamin C has not been proven to change the course of a common cold. Over-the-

counter medications are of dubious value. If one ingredient is helpful the others in the

combination may be in improper balance for effective results. ( European Jouranl of

Pediatrics 144:4-8, 1985).



VITAMIN C/IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA

Taking large doses (1500 mg. daily) of vitamin C to prevent colds may lead to iron-

deficiency anemia, apparently by blockage of the effects of copper, which is essential for

iron transport in the blood. Male volunteers given vitamin C supplements developed iron-

deficiency anemia despite an adequate iron intake. ( Science News 124:281, October 29,

1983).

There is a long list of experts in the field of nutrition who are expressing grave

concerns over the health threat from taking vitamins.

Our actual need for vitamins has been greatly exaggerated. The actual amount of

vitamins the human body needs for one year is very smal . Every vitamin necessary for

your body can be found in the food we eat. If we would eat a large variety of fresh food

(cooking partial y destroys vitamins), we wil not become vitamin deficient. We had a guest

named Betty in our 26-day lifestyle session. When she came she brought with her a

medium sized box ful of expensive organic supplements that she was ingesting every

day. She thought she needed these supplements and could not understand why she was

so nervous, felt weak, had a duodenal ulcer and gal bladder problems. She stopped

taking her expensive supplements, and with proper nutrition, at the end of the 26 day

session, she was not as nervous, had plenty of energy, her ulcer was completely healed,

and she was not suffering gal bladder problems anymore. Betty learned, while attending

our session, that the Creator intended for us to get our vitamins from whole natural foods,

and not from a vitamin bottle, as these are unnatural and can cause many health

problems.

WRINKLES



What To Do For Them





You are as beautiful as what you eat.

Eat plenty of fresh fruits which are high in minerals,

enzymes, and vitamins, especial y Vitamin C which

assures integrity of connective tissue which wil support

and strengthen the skin. If this support is not there, the

skin becomes loose and wrinkled(1).

Fluoride levels as low as one part per mil ion, the

amount added to city water supplies, wil cause a

breakdown of col agen, which makes up about thirty

percent of the body. Disruption of this basic structural

material - its synthesis and repair - results in skin

wrinkling(2). Deficient nutrition shows up first in the skin, because the body's wil to survive

causes available nutrients to be rushed to the vital organs.

Drink plenty of pure water, which helps circulation and wil lessen wrinkles. Use no

supplements, especial y calcium which causes wrinkling.

Trying to feed the skin from the outside by applying most types of lotions do little good

for anybody except those who sel them.



TWO LOTIONS I RECOMMENDED ARE COLD PRESSED OLIVE OIL AND FRESH

ALOE VERA .



We must feed the skin from the inside. Sensitive skin and a reddish nose or

cheeks, ruddy from broken capil aries, are signs of nutritional deficiency. When the skin is

dry and scaly, it is usual y from not drinking enough water.

Stress can cause wrinkles, such as a negative attitude reflected in habitual

wrinkles. Those who frown al the time acquire permanent frowning wrinkles. Those who

smile and laugh a lot acquire pleasant wrinkles. We can many times tel what kind of

disposition a person has by looking at the lines on his face.

CHAPTER ONE

After several months of preparation, now came Kiranâ€™s time to prove his worth. Dressed in a red tunic adorned in golden swirls on the hems, and grey trousers beneath, he carefully crept through the lush bushes in search of his target. Apart from a compact, metal cannon in a bronze frame, Kiran had a knapsack on his back with his various necessities inside, along with a staff he placed through a strap on his bag.
Most of the sunlight was hidden by the thickness of the jungleâ€™s trees, and Kiran had to rely on the effectiveness of his eyes. The parts of the soil present had a sandy tone and texture, however Kiran was more focused on following the footprints of his prey. He occasionally looked up to see his surroundings, knowing he was not the only one out here on the hunt.
Focus, Kiran, he thought. This is your only chance.
Kiran, at sixteen years old, needed to obtain a special ingredient in order to start preparing the spells for the tournament, and that vital ingredient he needed, was right before him nibbling on a few fallen mangos.
Among all the beasts on the continent of Aardel, bosdrakes were one of the rarest. They were few in numbers, and said to only lay ten eggs every twenty years. Some said it was a curse from the gods as a means of curving the rise in numbers of the powerful creatures, but the bosdrakes never were the type to tell.
The typical bosdrake was ten meters tall from head to toe, with a thick tail half its height, capable of levelling small trees in one swing. But the one before Kiran was around five feet tall, fairly young. It had yellow skin and a stocky build, itâ€™s thick arms and legs ending in four digits with large talons. It had a large head with a blunt snout, and its eyes were bright green and its mouth wide. The bosdrake had two rows of orange studs on its head that ran all the way down to its tail that coiled against its back, with green hair set in a drooping mohawkâ€”unlike Kiranâ€™s hair was braided into ten individual locks. This bosdrake in particular also wore a necklace of red and copper stones and square wood carvings.
Besides the smoothness of its jaw and the eyelashes, Kiran could tell it was a female by its exposed genitals; a plump labia with dark lips and round breasts. The sight of it caused blood to rush down Kiranâ€™s groin, and he had to briefly pause and wait till his thoughts settled.
The bosdrake hummed a sweet tune as she sat on her bottom beneath the tree, entertaining her eyes with the swaying branches as she ate.
Nowâ€™s my chance! Kiran thought. He lifted his cannon and looked along the iron sight. Kiran made sure he had the bosdrakeâ€™s head in view, and pulled the trigger. The hammer struck, and the cannon bucked with a flash of smoke from the muzzle, releasing a ball the shape and size of a chicken egg.
But to Kiranâ€™s horror, the bosdrake ducked, and the projectile struck a tree and exploded into a cloud of brown smoke. It was a concoction of chemicals with enough strength to knockout a fully-grown wildebeest.
â€œOh no!â€ said Kiran as he punched the spent shell out of the side of the cannon. At the base of it was a cartridge that held four rounds, one of which he just wasted.
The bosdrake laughed mockingly as she got up and faced Kiran. The intensity of her glare caused him to flinch. â€œAmateur human!â€ she said. â€œYou disguised your footsteps, but I smelt you coming a mile away. Hold your weapon!â€
Kiran was about to point the weapon at her but he froze. That was when the bosdrake said, â€œWho are you? And what do you want with me?â€
â€œM-My name is Kiranâ€¦â€ His voice was shaky, but nonetheless he bravely spoke. â€œIâ€™m a sorcerer in trainingâ€¦and Iâ€™m looking for an ingredient for my next spellâ€¦â€
â€œWhat kind of ingredient?â€ The bosdrake took four steps towards Kiran. The boy took four steps back. â€œAnswer now you blasted human!â€
Kiran swallowed a nervous lump. â€œâ€¦I need the queex of a bosdrake.â€
The dragon gawked at Kiran. â€œWhat?â€ She was well aware of what â€œqueexâ€ was; the creamy vaginal fluid of any woman, possessing magical properties as a result of being influenced by their soul. â€œOh, so you wanted to rape me, huh?â€
â€œWait! No!â€ said Kiran. â€œI was just going to knock you out and scrape out some of it!â€
â€œLiar!â€ the bosdrake ran after Kiran, chasing him between the bushes and trees. Kiran attempted to point the cannon around him and fire, but his shot missed the bosdrake. She was running on all fours, and despite her slight chubbiness she was getting dangerously closer.
Kiran hurried clumsily down slope and served towards a path that lead out of the jungle. Just as Kiran found the grassy path, he felt the full weight of the bosdrake as she pounced upon him.
They rolled in a heap; Kiran trying to free himself from the bosdrakeâ€™s grasp while she tried to pin him down. Eventually her strength overpowered his, and she knelt over Kiran, smiling and bearing her sharp teeth.
â€œIâ€™ve got you now, human,â€ she said.
â€œPlease, let me go!â€ said Kiran.
â€œIâ€™ll let you goâ€¦after Iâ€™ve bitten off that pretty nose of yours!â€ And the bosdrake opened her mouth wide enough that Kiran could see all forty of her teeth. 
He screamed and closed his eyes. â€œDoooooonâ€™t!â€
Kiran saw his whole life flash before his eyes, and as his body tensed in preparation for his end. But nothing came. 
Reluctantly, Kiran opened his eyes one by one, seeing the bosdrake looking at him impatiently. After he caught his breath, Kiran said, â€œYouâ€™re...not going to eat me?â€
â€œNo,â€ said the bosdrake, getting off the young man. â€œHumanâ€™s taste awful.â€ She walked over to the cannon on the ground and picked it up.
Kiran scurried to his feet. â€œâ€¦Why?â€
The bosdrake abruptly smashed the cannon over her knee. Kiran yelp in disbelief. He ran over to the two piece and took them up. â€œMy cannon!â€ He held the objects dejectedly in his hands. He looked at the beast. â€œYou broke my cannon!â€
â€œWould you have preferred If I broke your neck instead?â€ said the bosdrake staunchly.
Kiran imaged the horror of his vertebrae snapping like a twig, and suddenly looked at the pieces of his weapon as if they were nothing. â€œAwww blastâ€¦â€ He tossed the parts away. â€œNow Iâ€™ll never get the queex I want.â€
The bosdrake, sensing no killing intent from the human, felt comfortable enough to ask, â€œWhat do you need my queex for?â€
Kiran regarded her with a baffled stare. â€œI told, I need it for a spell?â€
â€œYouâ€™re a wizard?â€ said the bosdrake.
â€œUhâ€¦yesâ€¦yes I amâ€¦â€ The conversation felt too alien for the young boy. â€œExcuse meâ€¦miss bosdrakeâ€”â€
