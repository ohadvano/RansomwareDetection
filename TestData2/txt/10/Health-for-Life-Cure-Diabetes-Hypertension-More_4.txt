PART I




Part I of this book takes a close look at

the Eight Natural Remedies that we can

all use and take advantage of to

maintain and improve our health. These

Eight Natural Remedies are Fresh Air,

Pure Water, Sunshine, Natural Food,

Rest, Exercise, Temperance and Trust in

God.

FRESH AIR





Air is an invisible, tasteless, odorless mixture of gases surrounding the earth. Air at

sea level is composed of 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, 1% water vapor, carbon dioxide and

traces of ammonia, argon, helium, and other rare gases. Experiments have shown that

death wil occur from prolonged inhalation of air, in which the proportion of oxygen is much

greater than that in which it natural y occurs in the atmosphere. Therefore, we know that

the mixture cal ed air is not an accidental compound, but one perfectly adapted by our

Creator to the needs of the human body.

The first need of al living creatures on this earth is oxygen. They can not live

without it. Oxygen must always be present in the air we breathe. Al of the tril ions of cel s

in the human body must receive a constant supply of oxygen or those cel s wil weaken

and die. Through the tissue fluids the cel obtains the oxygen it needs and gives up the

carbon dioxide it does not need. This transportation of oxygen from the outside air to the

tissue cel s, and the carrying away of carbon dioxide is done through our lungs.

Our lungs are light and spongy in texture. If placed in water, they wil float. Normal y we

breathe about fifteen times a minute, inhaling about a pint of air each time we take a

breath. The lungs normal y hold about six pints of air, so that about one sixth of the air is

exchanged each time we take a breath. A person sleeping uses only about 10% of his

lung capacity. Hard work increases lung use to about 50%. The singer or woodwind player

uses his lungs almost to the ful est extent possible. (1)



AIR IS ELECTRICALLY CHARGED

Air contains electricity. The air we breathe affects the body as if it

were charged with electricity. This electrical energy, absorbed by the

blood, is carried to al parts of the body. The air we breathe contains

both negatively charged ions and positively charged ions. Our bodies

need a larger portion of the negatively charged ions for optimum

health. As we breathe large quantities of positively charged ions (the

bad kind), we may feel such adverse effects as headache, nasal

obstruction, hoarseness, fatigue, dry throat, dizziness, etc. Breathing

mostly negatively charged air (the good kind) wil produce feelings of exhilaration and wel -



15





being. Negatively charged air has been shown to decrease the respiration rate and lower

blood pressure, while positively charged air does just the opposite. One group of

researchers reported that patients who had high blood pressure and breathed negatively

charged air had an average drop of 39mmHg in systolic blood pressure. (2)

Negatively charged air (the good kind) is found in abundance at the ocean, in the

mountains, at the foot of a waterfal or by a river or stream. Al outside air has a large

amount of negative ions. This is why we feel so good when we go camping or to the

ocean. Or, if one is fatigued, a short walk outside in the fresh air wil liven up the whole

body. There are over 3-4 thousand negative ions in one cubic centimeter of mountain air,

but only 100 negative ions in one cubic centimeter of air in an office building at the end of

an eight hour day. Enclosed buildings have mostly positively charged ions which are

harmful to health. Al electrical appliances, air conditioning units, etc. use up the good

negative ions and give off positive ions. Al the air we exhale is positively charged; that's

why a person gets drowsy after sitting for a long time in a closed room that is ful of

people.

The Lungs Give Off Positively Charged Poisonous Gases



Both food and oxygen are taken by the blood to the cel s

and are there converted into heat and energy by a process

similar to combustion. When common fuel is burned, a by-

product is formed, a gas or smoke which is deadly and must be

removed. In like manner, the burning of food and oxygen in the

body cel s produce a positively charged carbonic acid gas

which is taken by lymph and blood to the lungs to be exhaled,

thus, saving the body from harm. If this elimination should

cease for a few minutes, life would cease. About thirty quarts of this positively charged

carbonic acid gas are exhaled per hour by one person. About one third of the body

wastes, which are poisons, go out from the lungs. We should always so arrange our

ventilation that those wastes wil quickly go out-of-doors rather than accumulate in the

room, thus enabling the lungs to always have a good supply of fresh, clean, negatively

charged air.

Our skin also needs pure fresh air. The skin has mil ions of minute openings known as

pores. One of the functions of these pores is to breathe in the fresh air. If we covered the

skin of a person with a material like paint and closed these pores up, the person would

suffocate in a short time.

Dr. Kel ogg, an authority in natural medicine, who stressed

adequate ventilation in homes, offices, and school rooms, estimates that

each person requires at least 3000 cubic feet of fresh air per hour to

dilute the poisons poured forth from his own lungs and skin. He tel s us

that any system of ventilation is inadequate which does not supply this

amount of air to each occupant of a dwel ing. Sick rooms and hospitals

require two or three times as much air as this on account of the

increased amount of contamination.



An old army surgeon who had charge of large hospitals during the

war related a very interesting experience il ustrating the importance of giving the sick,

especial y persons suffering with fever, and abundance of pure air. He said that in a large

hospital he had at one time 320 cases of measles during the winter season. The hospital

caught fire and burned to the ground and the patients had to be placed in tents. Al but

one or two recovered. He said he had no doubt but that the number of deaths would have

been thirty or forty at least, had the patients remained in the hospital.

One would never think of eating food some other person had chewed, yet we donâ€™t

realize how breathing enclosed, foul air over and over again wil poison the blood stream

and injure the lungs. To enjoy good health our homes should have plenty of ventilation
