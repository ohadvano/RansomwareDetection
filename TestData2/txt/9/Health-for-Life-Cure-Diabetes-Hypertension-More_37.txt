
spasms ceased, we were aroused to the painful fact that her intel ect was weakened. She

began slowly to improve, although stil a great sufferer. Her limbs were crippled from the

effect of the powerful poisons which she had taken. She lingered a few years a helpless,

pitiful sufferer, and died in much agony.11

After this sad narrative the father looked imploringly to the physician, and entreated

him to save his only remaining child. The physician looked sad and anxious, but made no

prescription. He arose to leave, saying that he would cal the next day.

The next day the physician was in the sick room, standing by the bedside of the

afflicted daughter. Again he left the room without giving medicine. The father, when in the

presence of the physician alone seemed deeply moved, and he inquired impatiently, "Do

you intend to do nothing? Wil you leave my only daughter to die?" The physician said, "I

have listened to the sad history of the death of your much loved wife, and your two

children, and have learned from your own lips that al three have died while in the care of

physicians, while taking medicines prescribed and administered by their hands. Medicine

has not saved your loved ones, and as a physician I solemnly believe that none of them

need, or ought to have died. They could have recovered if they had not been so drugged

that nature was enfeebled by abuse, and final y crushed. He stated decidedly to the

agitated father. "I cannot give medicine to your daughter. I shal only seek to assist nature

in her efforts, by removing every obstruction, and then leave nature to recover the

exhausted energies of the system" He placed in the father's hand a few directions which

he enjoined upon him to fol ow closely. "Keep the patient free from excitement, and every

influence calculated to depress. Her attendants should be cheerful and hopeful. She

should have a simple diet, and should be al owed plenty of pure soft water to drink. Bathe

frequently in pure soft water fol owed by gentle rubbing. Let the light and air, be freely

admitted into her room. She must have quiet, and undisturbed rest."

The father slowly read the prescription, and wondered at the few simple directions it

contained, and seemed doubtful of any good resulting from such simple means. Said the

physician, "You have had sufficient confidence in my skil to place the life of your daughter

in my hands.â€ Withdraw not your confidence, I wil visit your daughter daily, and direct you

in the management of her case. Fol ow my directions with confidence, and I trust in a few

weeks to present her to you in a much better condition of health, if not ful y restored."

The father looked sad and doubtful, but submitted to the decision of the physician.

He feared that his daughter must die if she had no medicine. At a later date the daughter

was sitting by the side of her father cheerful and happy, with the glow of health upon her

countenance. The father was looking upon her with happy satisfaction, his countenance

speaking the gratitude of his heart, that his only child was spared to him. Her physician



122

entered, and after conversing with the father and child for a short time arose to leave. He

addressed the father, thus, "I present to you your daughter restored to health. I gave her

no medicine that I might leave her with an unbroken constitution. Medicine never could

have accomplished this. Medicine deranges nature's fine machinery, and breaks down the

constitution, and kil s, but never cures. Nature alone possesses the restorative powers.

She alone can build up her exhausted energies, and repair the injuries she has received

by inattention to her fixed laws."

He asked the father if he was satisfied with his manner of treatment. The happy

father expressed his heart felt gratitude, and perfect satisfaction, saying, "I have learned a

lesson I shal never forget. It was painful, yet it is of priceless value. I am now convinced

that my wife and children need not have died. Their lives were sacrificed while in the

hands of physicians by their poisonous drugs."



GEORGE WASHINGTON: MEDICAL MARTYR





On December 13th, 1799, George Washington summoned his doctor after coming

down with a sore throat. His doctor bled him four times, injected him with poisonous

mercury, gave him more mercury by mouth, then blistered his throat with a compound of

vinegar and dead bugs. After enduring this torturous treatment for a single day, the Father

of Our Country begged his doctor to leave him alone and let him die in peace - which he

did, at 10:00 PM on December 14.



STATISTICS CONFIRMS HARMFUL USE OF DRUGS



100,000 deaths a year (over 300 per day), are caused by prescription

medications. This figure is only on those reported by hospitals or physicians.

Journal of the American Medical Ass. April 15, 1998



One would think that doctors contribute to a decrease in mortality rates. Ironical y,

however, the reverse happens. Statistics gathered during doctors strikes in 1973, 1976

and 1978 proved their absence coincided with decreased death rates. These are as

fol ows:



1973 - Israel 29 day physician strike - 50% less deaths reported by Jerusalem Burial

Society.

1976 - Columbia 52 day physician strike -35% decrease in deaths in BogotÃ¡,

Columbia confirmed by Morticians Association of Columbia.

1978 - Los Angeles Doctors went out on strike for two months and death rate fel by

35%. When they went back to work, the death rate increased by 40%.

In a 1980 American study, 20% of al patients admitted into hospitals suffered one

or more latrogenic episodes. This means one person out of five suffered from drug

reactions, negative reactions to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and ward

accidents. Medication errors were responsible for 11% of the mistakes!

"It appears that therapeutic drugs are major causes of birth defects and learning

disabilities when used during pregnancy. Connecticut figures suggest that as many as

13.4 percent of al congenital malformations may be caused by drugs prescribed by

doctors during pregnancy. Drugs like Valium appear to cause birth defects, learning

disabilities, and hyper activity."

THE HEART

The human heart is red brown in color and weighs approximately 12 ounces. It is

about six inches long, and its widest point is four inches

across. It is more pear shaped than valentine shaped.

The great throbbing center of al human life and activity

is the heart. No other organ carries so much responsibility for

the rest of the body. When your heart is strong and healthy

the whole body benefits. When it is sick, the whole body

suffers. That is why it is so important for you to take care of

your heart.

Can a person strain his heart by overwork? No, it is

almost impossible to strain the healthy human heart by overwork. The heart is far more

likely to be damaged by disease and by poor habits of living than by any physical activity.

But once the heart has been damaged by disease, it may be necessary to avoid too much

activity. A heart that has been damaged can be strained beyond its limits.

The heart is a very efficient four-chambered pump, actual y two pumps, one to

move blood to the lungs, the other to push it out into the body. Every day it pumps blood

through 60,000 miles of blood vessels, and pumps enough blood to fil a 4,000 gal on

railroad car.

As long as you are alive, your heart never stops working. It has enormous reserve

powers to meet any crisis that may arise. If it has been damaged by disease, it repairs

itself while it works! If its valves become thickened because of some disease, such as

rheumatic fever, the heart wil thicken up its own muscular wal s to try to compensate for

any lack of efficiency. Even while your heart is working, its own muscle cel s are busy

selecting the materials they need for their own growth and repair.



PULSE RATE



Relatively little attention is paid these days to the heart rate or pulse. The heart

typical y beats 70-80 times a minute when an individual is sitting down. This adds up to

over 100,000 beats per day. However, under physical or mental stress the body requires

more oxygen and the heart accordingly steps up the pace to perhaps 150-200 beats a

minute.

Athletes have low pulses, especial y long distance runners, whose rates can

normal y be 35 to 40 beats per minute. Women's rates are general y higher than men's.

Children and babies have stil higher rates, from 80-150 beats per minute.

A healthy individual, who has a resting pulse rate of 70 beats per minute in
