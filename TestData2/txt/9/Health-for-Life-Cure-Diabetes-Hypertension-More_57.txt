
needs to be replaced daily. It is needed in the production of antibodies and red blood cel s,

and is necessary for the production of hydrochloric acid and magnesium. It helps prevent

various nervous and skin disorders. A pyridoxine deficiency can cause depression,

learning difficulties, convulsions, anemia, hair loss, poor hearing, etc. Birth control pil s

cause Vitamin B6 deficiency in about 25% of their users. Some natural food sources of

pyridoxine are whole grain cereals, legumes, bananas, potatoes, cabbage, and oatmeal.



VITAMIN B-12 (COBALAMIN)

Vitamin B12 is water soluble and effective in very smal doses; it can be stored in

the liver for years. Vitamin B12 is needed to form and regenerate red blood cel s, for iron

absorption, to maintain a healthy nervous system, for proper utilization of fats,

carbohydrates, and protein, and to improve concentration, memory, and balance.

Vitamin B12 supplements can be harmful. A group of French investigators reported

a series of cases suggesting that B12 supplements may stimulate multiplication of cancer

cel s and aggravate the disease. B12 encourages cel division in general, and certain

tumor cel s in particular(1). B12 deficiency is a rare disorder, and the majority of cases

occur in meat eaters and not among vegetarians as previously thought. Deficiency

symptoms are mental depression, ringing in the ears, enlarged liver and spleen,

pernicious anemia (a dangerous decrease in red blood cel s), and neurological damage.

Some natural vegetarian food sources of B12 are wheat, soybeans, various common

greens, olives, fruits, and many other foods that occasional y have B12 either in or on the

food. Vitamin B12 has been found in roots and stems of tomatoes, in cabbage, celery, and

broccoli. It is also found in sea weed and alfalfa(2). A further source of B12 is bacterial

growth found in the mouth.



VITAMIN C (ASCORBIC ACID)

Vitamin C is water soluble and is excreted in just a few hours; it cannot be stored in

the body. Vitamin C prevents scurvy, helps heal wounds, burns, and bleeding gums. It

assists in resistance to infection, in the absorption of iron, and in the formation of

hemoglobin. A Vitamin C deficiency can cause scurvy, fatigue, loss of appetite, easy

bruising, easy bleeding, slow-healing wounds, loose teeth, and anemia. Vitamin C

supplements can be harmful. Excessive quantities reduce the pH of the urine to as low as

four, increasing the risks of kidney stones. It also wil interfere with purine metabolism,

increasing the risk of gout. Large doses of Vitamin C may also promote cancer(3). Some

natural food sources of Vitamin C are al fruits, and green, leafy vegetables. Carbon



177

monoxide destroys Vitamin C, so those who live in the cities should definitely eat extra

amounts of foods containing Vitamin C.



VITAMIN D (CALCIFEROL!, VIOSTEROID, ERGOSTEROL)

Vitamin D is an oil soluble vitamin, and it is stored in the body. It is known as the

sunshine vitamin because it is formed when the ultraviolet rays of the sun act on the skin

to produce Vitamin D, which is then absorbed into the body. Vitamin D is needed to

regulate the absorption of calcium and phosphorous. A Vitamin D deficiency leads to

rickets, a disease in which the bones do not form properly (knock knees, bow legs, etc.). It

wil also cause severe tooth decay, osteoporosis, muscular weakness, loss of appetite,

and loss of weight. The only natural source is sunshine. There is a limited amount of

Vitamin D in some animal products, which I do not consider a natural source, and would

not recommend.



VITAMIN E (TOCOPHEROL)

Vitamin E is fat soluble and is stored for long periods of time in the liver, fatty

tissues, heart, and muscles of the body. Many months of deprivation would be required to

deplete the body of Vitamin E. One of the important functions of Vitamin E is to aid in

carrying oxygen to the tissues. Vitamin E is also essential for the adequate absorption of

iron. Vitamin E keeps you looking younger, gives you endurance by supplying oxygen to

the body. It helps prevent and dissolve clotting of blood cel s. It prevents thick scar

formation external y, and accelerates the healing of wounds. It can lower blood pressure;

and aids in the prevention of miscarriages. A Vitamin E deficiency rarely occurs. It is

prevalent in nearly every food, Green plants, grains, nuts, legumes, various seeds, fruits,

and vegetables al contain Vitamin E.



VITAMIN K (MENADIONE)

Vitamin K is fat soluble and is stored in the body. This vitamin promotes proper

blood clotting, and helps to keep one from bleeding to death. Vitamin K deficiency wil

cause internal bleeding, hemorrhages, and excessive menstrual flow. Some natural food

sources of this vitamin are alfalfa, green leafy vegetables, tomatoes, and grains.

VITAMIN AND

MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS



Are vitamin and mineral supplements needed in the diet? Which ones are essential,

and how much should we take? The answer to these questions is quite simple: If our

creator would have wanted us to take Vitamin C, He would have created a tree that grew

Vitamin C pil s. Instead He created many different fruit trees, and the fruit contains the

Vitamin C our bodies need. The American people have been convinced that vitamins are

good for their health, and over 40% take supplemental vitamins every day.

Our actual need for vitamins and minerals has been greatly exaggerated. The

actual amount of vitamins the human body needs for one year is very smal . Every vitamin

and mineral necessary to the body can be found in the food we eat. There is a long list of

experts in the field of nutrition who are expressing grave concerns over the health threat

posed from taking vitamins and mineral supplements.

Dr. Myron Winick, director of the Institute of Human Nutrition at Columbia

University, indicates that some vitamins, long considered not harmful, are producing

medical problems including nerve damage, mild intestinal distress, and fatal liver damage.

(Los Angeles Times 12/30/83). Recent reports on excessive use of Vitamin B6 warns that

it can cause nerve damage. Symptoms include unsteady walking, numbness, or tingling in

the hands and feet. Microscopic analysis shows deterioration of nerve fibers in direct

proportion to the amount of B6 ingested. These and other neurological problems may

require months to recover from, and can be permanent.

According to an article in the Health Reporter by Robert McCarter, PhD, man-made

supplements are simply not what was intended for the human body. In the process of

extracting and fractionating elements, they are rendered worthless. Once removed and

isolated, vitamins lose their value. Technology exists that can create a grain of wheat in

the laboratory. Every needed chemical component can be duplicated and made into a

grain of wheat; but if it's put into the ground it wil not grow. Why? Because it is not natural.

Man cannot improve upon the natural way our Creator has given us to get our

vitamins and minerals. For example: there are several cautions against taking Vitamin C.

There are side effects. Vitamin C has an anti-Vitamin D effect. That means that when you

take extra Vitamin C, your body requires extra Vitamin D. Another side effect is that

Vitamin C may also decrease availability of the B Vitamins, particularly B6 and B12. One

orange has 70 mil igrams of Vitamin C; it also contains .11 mil igrams of thiamine, .05

mil igrams of riboflavin, etc...The orange also has minerals: 52 mil igrams of calcium, 18

mil igrams of phosphorus, etc.... When you take a Vitamin C supplement you are only

getting Vitamin C and none of the other vitamins and minerals in proportion that our

Creator intended for you to have as a total package.

We know that the ratio of Vitamin C to Vitamin D is important; that the ratio of

potassium to magnesium is important; and the ratio of calcium to magnesium is important.

But what about those we do not know about? Since our knowledge is so limited in al the

proper ratios, it is possible for us to cause a body imbalance by indiscriminately taking

vitamin and mineral supplements. I recommend that we eat natural foods, which have al



179

the vitamins and minerals we need in them, even the ones we haven't discovered yet; and

that we not waste our money or health on supplements.



"NATURAL VERSUS SYNTHETIC VITAMINS

Paul Stitt, a biochemist, and food scientists for some of the largest corporations in

the United States, reports that government regulations require that only three percent of a

food supplement be natural ingredients before the food can be labeled "natural" He points

out that because synthetic vitamins are so much less expensive, it is likely that many of

the "natural" vitamins on the market are 97% synthetic. He says it would require 30

oranges to produce one 1000 mg. vitamin C tablet, and a bottle of al natural vitamin C

tablets could cost about four hundred dol ars(l) It should be noted, however that even if the

bottle of Vitamin C were al from oranges and cost four hundred dol ars, it would stil not

be natural Vitamin C, as it has been separated from the orange. Get your Vitamin C from

the true source, the food itself.



MEGA VITAMINS/LEARNING DISORDERS

A group of 20 children with learning disabilities were given large doses of ascorbic

acid, niacinamide, calcium pantothenate and pyrodoxine, along with a low-carbohydrate,

high-protein diet. After a six-month period, the children receiving the megavitamins

demonstrated no significant improvement as compared to a group treated by diet alone.
