Since prior to WWII (1939-45) it has been known that microwaves are hazardous to

biological systems. Therefore, threshold tolerances are in use which may differ from

country to country according to the differing views and technical needs.



Al food, which was heated, defrosted or cooked in the microwave oven caused

significant changes in the blood of the test persons. These changes included: decrease of

al hemoglobin values and cholesterol values, especial y the HDL and LDL. Lymphocytes

showed a more distinct short term decrease after the intake of food from the microwave

oven than after the intake of al the other variants.

There was a highly significant association between the amount of microwave

energy in irradiated food and the luminous power of luminescent bacteria exposed to

serum from test persons who ate that food. This leads to the conclusion that technical

energies, such as microwave energy, may indeed be passed to man inductively via

irradiated food. This process is based on physical principles and has already been

confirmed in the literature. The measured effects of microwave irradiated food on man, as

opposed to non-irradiated food, show changes in the blood of test persons indicative of an

early pathogenic process similar to the actual start of cancer.

The spectrum from microwave, as defined by today's science, reaches from about

10" to 10" Hz. Therefore, microwaves extend with their long waves far into the range of

radio waves, and with their short waves into the range of infra-red light. That means,

therefore, that microwaves comprise the 4 wave ranges of radio, television, military

shooting and guidance systems as wel as microwave cooking.

There is extensive scientific literature concerning the hazardous effects of direct

microwave radiation on living systems. This literature is of such informative value that it is

astonishing to realize how little effort has been taken to replace this detrimental technique

of microwaves by a technology more in accordance with nature. The destructive effects of

microwaves include damaging cel membranes, enforced anaerobic breathing, disturbed

cel division, hemolysis, leukemia, genetic defects, and even ful inactivation of the natural

cycles.

Technical y produced microwaves are based on the principle of alternating current.

Atoms, molecules and cel s hit by this hard electromagnetic radiation are forced to reverse

polarity 1-100 bil ion times per second. There are no atoms, molecules or cel s of any



138

organic system which are able to withstand such a violent, destructive power for any

extended period of time not even in the range of mil iwats. Of al natural substances -

which are polar - the oxygen of water molecules reacts most sensitively. Structures of

molecules are torn apart, molecules are forceful y deformed (structural isomerism) and

thus become impaired in quality. This type of forced, chaotic movement in molecules and

cel s produces frictional heat. Contrary to conventional heating of food on a fire or a stove,

by which heat transfers convectional y from without to within, heating by microwaves

begins within at those places where the radiation energy is absorbed, where water is

present, and where energy is transformed into frictional heat.

Taking al results into account, it can be seen that food prepared in the microwave

oven - in contrast to al the other variants - causes abnormal changes in the blood of test

persons indicating disorder. These early and subtle changes, which can also be found in a

cancerous process, deserve attention. The results correspond to the chemical

physiological changes as wel as damages to living cel s caused by direct irradiation of

microwaves.



The luminous power of bacteria in contact with serum from test persons who

consumed food prepared in the microwave oven is significantly higher than that with

serum from test persons after the intake of the other food variants. Therefore, an inductive

transfer of radiation energy, such as microwave energy, via ingesting irradiated food into

living organisms, must be taken into consideration. Such physical processes are wel

grounded in science. Thus, the obvious destructive properties of microwaves, supported

by the above data and literature, are not only hazardous to man by direct radiation, but

also indirectly via irradiated food.



(Editor's Note: Throw your microwave out. I have been looking for information on

the harmful effects of microwaves for sometime now, but there is very little in print. I'm

thankful to Search For Health for letting me reprint this article.)

MILK IS

HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH





More dairy products are consumed in the United States than in any other

country in the world. Only six per cent of Americans say they don't

consume milk in any form. One dol ar of every seven spent for food in the

United States goes for the purchase of milk and milk products. The

average amount of dairy products consumed per person in this country is

375 pounds each year.





MILK CAUSES DISEASE



As far back as 1931, diseases from cattle, transmitted to men through milk, were

receiving a prominent position in medical literature. Such diseases include cancer, skin

lesions, musculoskeletal abnormalities, pulmonary obstruction, immunological disorders

and liver function abnormalities(1).



Government regulation states that milk, after pasteurization, should contain no

more than 20,000 bacteria per mil iliter of milk, and no more than ten organisms of the

coliform species in each mil iliter. For those who are unfamiliar with the mil iliter as a

measurement, there are 5 mil iliters in a teaspoon. However, most milk samples tested

today have an average bacterial count in excess of 130,000 per mil iliter instead of 20,000.

A highly respected British medical journal The Lancet , published an editorial review

entitled "Beware of the Cow". The editorial went on to describe the report of an experiment

in which unpasteurized cow's milk from cows infected with bovine C-type virus (believed to

cause a form of leukemia in cattle), was fed to baby chimpanzees. 33% of the infant

chimpanzees developed leukemia and died. Leukemia had never before been observed in

chimpanzees, and most infections that can be transmitted to chimpanzees can also be

transmitted to humans. Dr. Henry Lemon, of the University of Nebraska Cancer Research

Institute, also sees a link between human leukemia and cattle leukemia.



Multiple sclerosis is another disease that two scientists, Drs. Bernard Agranoff and

David Goldberg from the University of Michigan, believes is linked to milk drinking. Their

study involved 26,000 persons with multiple sclerosis in the United States, and also

involved a study of twenty-one other nations (2).



For a number of decades, heart and artery disease, caused by an increase of

cholesterol and other blood fats, have been recognized as being associated with milk. Did

you know that 50% of the calories in a glass of whole milk comes from the fat? The "3.5

percent" is figured on the basis of weight, not calories.

Since milk is largely water, the fat to water ratio is quite low, but the fat to calories ratio is

high. Pure vegetarians have significantly lower serum cholesterol levels than either lacto-

vegetarians or non-vegetarians (3).

The drinking of large quantities of cow's milk has long been recognized to produce

iron-deficiency anemia in infants. Cow's milk contains less than one mil igram of iron per

quart, so it produces very little dietary iron, and at the same time produces iron loss by

inducing gastrointestinal bleeding.

Milk al ergies are not confined to childhood or infancy, but are frequently seen in

adults. The commonest type of food al ergy in the United States today is milk al ergy. In

adults we see nasal congestion, hay fever, asthma, middle ear afflictions, headaches,

dizziness, seizures, fatigue, tension, constipation, diarrhea, gas, vomiting blood, loss of

appetite, colitis, swel ing, skin al ergies, etc.. Milk al ergies do not always appear

immediately after drinking milk or eating food containing dairy products. This particular

characteristic of milk al ergy protects it from being suspected (4).

In a study by Alvarez and Hinshaw (Mayo Clinic), of foods that gave distress to 500

patients, milk ranked second on the list. In 500 other patients who had severe reactions to

foods such as vomiting, diarrhea, or severe pain where the cause was not obvious, cow's

milk was discovered to be the chief offender. With those who have ulcerative colitis, milk is

number one on the list of foods which may cause this disease (5).



MILK CAUSES MUCUS





Dairy products cause the formation of mucus in the system. The mucous

membranes become coated and forces everything to transpire in a very sluggish fashion

causing many problems, such as weight gain, and symptoms of running nose, sore throat,

sinus problems, coughing up large amounts of phlegm, etc.

The enzymes necessary to break down and digest milk are rennin and lactose.

They are al but gone by the age of three in most humans. There is an element in al milk
