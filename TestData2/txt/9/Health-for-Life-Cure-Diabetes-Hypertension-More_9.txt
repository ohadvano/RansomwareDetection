
reduction in the amount of cholesterol in the skin, but that it also affects the overal

cholesterol metabolism of the whole body. When the skin is exposed to sunlight,

cholesterol is destroyed so rapidly and to such a great extent that the total body

cholesterol is decreased. A study was done using 30 patients who had hardening of the

arteries. Each of these patient's blood cholesterol level was lower after a single sunlight

treatment. Other studies with larger numbers of patients show similar results.



SUNLIGHT LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE

A study done at Tulane University on the effect of ultraviolet light on blood pressure

showed that after a single exposure of the sun to a group of men with high blood pressure,

there was a marked lowering of the blood pressure lasting 5-6 days. In another study done

on average subjects, blood pressure dropped an average of 6 mmHg systolic and 8

mmHg diastolic after a single sunlight treatment. In individuals with high blood pressure

the effect is more striking. Some patients had the systolic pressure drop as much as 40

mmHg and diastolic by 20 mmHg.(8)

Contrary to most learned opinions, diastolic blood pressure is apparently not more

important than systolic blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure is believed to rise with



29

age. But the famous Framingham study showed that elderly individuals with high systolic

pressures had significantly higher mortality rates than their contemporaries with lower

systolic pressures.(9)



SUNSHINE LOWERS BLOOD SUGAR

Exposure to sunlight appears to have an insulin-like effect in that it causes a

lowering of the blood sugar. This is minimal in normal individuals, but dramatic in

diabetics. Sunlight facilitates the absorption of glucose into the cel s of the body and

stimulates the body to convert its blood sugar (glucose) into stored sugar (glycogen),

which is stored in the liver and muscles. This is the body's energy reserve that can be

instantly changed again into glucose to meet demands under normal or emergency

conditions.

Sunlight removes the sugar in the blood by increasing glycogen levels. Because of

this dramatic effect, a diabetic may need to adjust his insulin dose when he is fol owing a

sunbathing program because sunlight combined with insulin can have a very powerful

hypoglycemic effect. A, diabetic must sunbathe with caution. By gradual y decreasing the

dose of insulin, one may avoid a hypoglycemic reaction (10)





SUNLIGHT IMPROVES ARTHRITIS

We find that the use of sunlight for helping arthritis dates back many centuries. The

warm rays of the sun loosen stiff, sore joints and can have a general relaxing effect.

Sunlight also builds up the body's immune System. In Russia, sunlight treatments are

given routinely to miners because of their beneficial effects. In one study there was a

definite reduction of arthritis in those miners who received sunlight treatments.(11)

Cortisone was given to one group of children with severe arthritis, while a similar group

was given sunlight treatments. The arthritic Symptoms of those taking cortisone

decreased more rapidly, but the people in that group were also more susceptible to

infections and suffered some side effects from the cortisone. Although the arthritic

Symptoms of the group getting the sunlight treatments decreased more slowly, relief did

come. Resistance to infection increased, and of course, no one suffered from any of the

side effects that accompany cortisone treatment. (12)



SUNSHINE AND VITAMIN D

Recent discoveries reveal that Vitamin D is not so much a vitamin as it is a

hormone. As we become aware of Vitamin D's intricate functions as a hormone, we need

to seriously review the practice of widespread Vitamin D supplementation to our foods,

such as milk, baby foods, beverages, prepared breakfast cereals, flour, margarine, etc.

With al this supplementation, the average per capita intake is 2,435 I.U. per day or six

times the recommended 400 I.U. per day. (13)

Dietary intake of Vitamin D by pregnant women has been implicated in kidney

calcification and severe mental retardation in their offspring.(13) Children with mothers

taking extra Vitamin D in their diet may be born with a certain type of congenital heart

disease. (14)

Many authorities have recommended that Vitamin D be removed from our food. Dr.

Kinden, who gave a report from the University of Tromso, makes this Statement:

"Attempts should be made to restrict the intake of Vitamin D. from al sources." Also

recommending that Vitamin D should not be supplemental y added to food is the British

Medical Association (1950), the Canadian Bul etin on Nutrition (1953), and the American

Academy of Pediatrics (1963, 1965).



30

From the University of Tromso in Norway comes a report that a long term intake of

Vitamin D, only slightly above the 400 I.U. recommended may stimulate a heart attack.

Not only heart attacks, but also degenerative joint diseases and arthritis are mentioned in

the report, as diseases that are apparently promoted by an increased Vitamin D intake.(15)

In a study done in England, Vitamin D obtained from the skin's exposure to sunlight

was far superior to that obtained from oral ingestion. (16) One can easily see that the best

source of Vitamin D is the natural one, SUNSHINE. No report in scientific literature has

ever shown that a toxic dose of Vitamin D has been obtained from sunlight.





SUNLIGHT AND PINEAL GLAND

Research conducted at the National Institute of Health has now revealed that a

smal gland near the center of the brain actual y responds to light entering the eye. This

response is independent of, and apart from, the normal visual process. Under Stimulation

of light entering the eye, this gland - cal ed the pineal gland -controls the synthesis and

release of chemical substances (hormones, enzymes) into the bloodstream to be carried

to any one of several target sites in the neuro-endocrine System including the brain, the

pituitary, and the gonads.(17)



SUNLIGHT DESTROYS BACTERIA

Skin blemishes can be improved with sunshine. When sweat glands become

plugged and infected, sunlight can help to sterilize the area. Dead cel s in the outer layer

of skin tend to plug up the sweat glands, and sunlight causes a faster removal of the outer

layer of skin, al owing the sweat glands to drain, and thus decreasing the congestion.

Wounds receiving sunlight treatments seem to heal faster, and have a much greater blood

supply.(18)

Exposure to sunlight aids in the skin's resistance to disease by kil ing those germs

that are on the surface of the skin. Ultraviolet wave lengths that reach the earth vary in

length. The shorter wave lengths of ultraviolet light are the ones that are more bactericidal,

penetrating the superficial layers of the skin and kil ing bacteria in those layers. Not only

does the sun have a direct bactericidal effect on the skin, but it also changes the oils in the

skin into bactericidal agents themselves. Even the vapor rising from natural skin oils (after

exposure to sunlight) are capable of kil ing bacteria.

Recent studies examining the value of ultraviolet light in the disinfection of water

showed that if the irradiation was sufficiently strong and the flow of water slow enough,

water could be purified satisfactorily. Scientists reporting the results of one study

concluded that the sun's ultraviolet rays are an important factor in the natural purification

of water because of their effectiveness in kil ing E. Coli. By testing water samples from a

marine sewage disposal, it was demonstrated that sunlight could kil the microorganism E.

Coli to depths of 12 feet in sea water. (19) In another study, done approximately 10 years

after the study just mentioned, waste stabilization ponds were exposed to sunlight, and

the researchers concluded that solar ultraviolet light is indeed an important, though

seldom appreciated factor, in the natural purification of water.(20)





SUNLIGHT AND SEX HORMONES

Our twenty-four hour days are divided into periods of light and darkness. This

division appears to play an important role in our hormone production. If this division of light

and dark is changed, it wil affect the hormone balance. Humans when kept in darkness,



31



such as children who are blind, wil become sexual y mature sooner than children who are

not blind.(21)

Americans over the past few decades have been moving from country living and

outdoor life into the cities and indoor factory or office life. Lighting indoors provides only

one-tenth as much light as out-of-doors in the shade. During this same period of time

when Americans have been moving indoors, the age when children become sexual y

mature has been decreasing.

Sunlight affects the hormonal balance of the body in two ways: by stimulating

glandular production when light passes through the eye into the brain, and by producing

hormones directly in the skin. When light enters the eye, it stimulates nerves in the back of

the eye to send Impulses to the spinal cord. From there the impulse is sent back into the

brain to a tiny organ cal ed the pineal gland. The pineal gland produces a hormone cal ed

melatonin. This hormone affects the brain and other glands such as the pituitary, adrenals,

ovaries, and testes. It also seems to have control of various glandular functions: for

example, it can stop the ovaries from ovulation and can delay sexual maturity. When

sunlight strikes the skin, it produces sex hormones in the skin itself Research reports

show that sunlight produces an estrogen-like substance in the skin which moves into the

blood. It elevates female hormones, but the male hormones are elevated to an even

greater degree. When the chest or back is exposed to sunlight, the male hormones may

increase by 120%.(22)
