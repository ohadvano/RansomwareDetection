
(windows opened winter and summer). With our modern, sealed homes and air

conditioning units re-circulating a large percentage of the impure indoor air, we are

starving our lungs of pure, fresh air. The oxygen the body obtains from the air is very

important in maintaining good health. Without the abundance of pure fresh air, the

important work of normalizing the blood chemistry could not be successful y performed

and the individual would suffer serious consequences.



â€œScientific evidence shows that the indoor air can be more seriously pol uted than

whatâ€™s out of the window, even in the largest and most industrial cities,â€ says Dave Ryan,

an air pol ution expert and spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in

Washington D.C.





FRESH AIR CRISES IN BUILDINGS

In the 1970's around the time of the energy crisis and the resulting trend toward

conservation, many of the buildings built, were to be so-cal ed energy efficient. New

homes and offices were built with fewer windows. Sealing buildings to make them energy

efficient became the norm, leaving occupants dependent on mechanical systems rather

than open windows for fresh negatively charged outside air and ventilation.

In large office buildings the problems are much worse. One Environmental

Protection Agency study of indoor air quality in various public buildings found a typical air

sample contained 100 to 200 different chemicals at levels that were much higher indoors

than outside. Some of those chemicals were paints, adhesives, caulking, vinyl, telephone

cables, printed documents, furniture, various solvents, formaldehyde, etc. Many

dangerous biological agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungal spores, algae, pol en, mold,

etc. are also found. These biological agents can cause many al ergic reactions.

Legionnaire's Disease and severe respiratory problems are also caused from these

biological agents. By inhaling this impure air, the blood is poisoned, the lungs become

affected, and the whole system is diseased.

A clear connection between poor building ventilation and disease was made in a

four-year study published in 1988, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in

Washington D. C tracked the respiratory health of recruits at four separate army training

centers. The study was notable because the subjects were a highly control ed group. They

were drawn randomly from al over the country; they al received identical immunizations

during processing; the soldiers in one barracks tended not to have contact with those in

another; and at each camp the soldiers did the same activities outdoors, under the same

conditions. Indoors, however, some subjects lived in energy-efficient barracks; and some

lived in open window barracks. At each camp the incidence of acute respiratory disease

was at least 45% higher in the energy-efficient barracks.

Air conditioning units just take the impure positively charged air from the room, cool it

down, add a very smal amount of outside air with it and re-circulate this impure positively

charged, germ-laden air right back into the room again. And people wonder why they don't

feel good after being inside al day long! Our forefathers didn't have air conditioners;

instead they had large ceilings with tal windows that opened from top and bottom, and

ceiling fans to help keep them cool in the summer.

NATURAL WAY TO PURIFY AIR

One natural way to help purify the air in your home or office is to

have plenty of live plants, for they take the carbon dioxide we exhale

and convert it into oxygen. One plant wil remove up to 87% of al toxins

in 100 square feet of living area every 24 hours. So, if your home or

office is 2000 sq. ft. in size you would need 20 plants placed throughout

your home or office.





IMPROPER BREATHING

Mil ions of people suffer from a wide variety of ailments that are partly caused by an

insufficient supply of oxygen. The problem is that most people do not breathe correctly.

Many people are shal ow breathers, only fil ing the top portion of their lungs. When we

completely fil our lungs with air the bottom portion of the lungs wil push the diaphragm

down, and this action wil push the stomach out. If your stomach doesn't come out as you

breathe, then you are not breathing correctly.

Exercise stimulates you to breathe faster and deeper. Your diaphragm, a dome-

shaped sheet of muscle fibers dividing your chest from your abdomen, contracts with each

breath and pul s downward. This in turn creates a vacuum in your chest cavity that sucks

air into your lungs. Then when your diaphragm muscles relax and rise, the air is pushed

out. This forces open mil ions of air cel s that you do not use in sedentary living. Vigorous

breathing not only brings in the needed oxygen for your blood-stream to carry to the

tissues, but it also strengthens and protects your organs against disease and keeps them

fit for action. The great advantage of abundance of lung exercise is seen in the fact that

professional singers suffer less from lung infections than others.





FRESH AIR AND CHEERFULNESS

One of the benefits that children and adults receive from being much in

the open air is cheerfulness. It has been shown that positively charged air, (the

bad kind) causes an overproduction of a stress hormone cal ed serotonin in

mammals. This hormone is associated with sudden changes in

mood. So, when our children get in a bad mood and are cross or

whiny, take them outdoors to run and play where they can get some

generous doses of negatively charged pure fresh air, to counteract their

stress.





OXYGEN KILLS CANCER CELLS

Cancer cel s cannot live in the presence of negatively charged oxygen. When

exposed to oxygen they die. (3) That tel s me that we need to learn to breathe deeply of

pure fresh country air. We know that oxygen makes up 21% of the earth's atmosphere, yet

researchers have found that the levels have dropped to less than 15% over some

metropolitan areas.

WOUNDS HEAL FASTER

It is a wel -known fact that wounds exposed to sunshine and fresh air heal more

rapidly than when bandaged. In fact, no wound wil heal without air. In order, then, for

wounds to heal quickly, it is most important that they be exposed to a constant supply of

pure fresh air.





THE BEST PLACE TO LIVE

Pol utants in the air! Everyone is worried about what modern

technology is doing to us. This is especial y true in cities, where car

exhausts, industries and waste disposal facilities spew pol utants into

the air. So the best place to live is in the

country where the air is purer. What kind of

country home is best to live in? A home of

frame construction is preferable to a block

home which tends to be damp and cold. Do not rent or purchase

a home that does not have plenty of windows with cross

ventilation. Shade trees and shrubbery too close and dense

around a house are unhealthful, for they prevent a free circulation of air. Make sure the

home is not in any kind of low concavity. Watch out for homes in hol owed out places, for

they tend to be drained ground; this wil help prevent the danger of disease due to

dampness from low-lying, il -drained land.





IN CONCLUSION

One of the finest statements I have found written on the importance of air are these

words penned by an outstanding health educator: "In order to have good blood we must

breathe wel - ful , deep inspirations of pure air, which fil the lungs with oxygen and purify

the blood. They impart to it a bright color and send it, a life-giving current, to every part of

the body. A good respiration soothes the nerves; it stimulates the appetite and renders

digestion more perfect; and it induces sound refreshing sleep. If an insufficient supply of

oxygen is received, the blood moves sluggishly, the waste, poisonous matter which should

be thrown off in the exhalations from the lungs is retained, and the blood becomes impure.

Not only the lungs, but the stomach, liver, and brain are affected. The skin becomes

shal ow; digestion is retarded; the heart is depressed; the brain is clouded; the thoughts

are confused; gloom settles upon the spirits; the whole system becomes depressed and

inactive, and peculiarly susceptible to disease." (3)

As you can readily see, the health of the whole body depends in part upon the

healthy action of the respiratory organs and the kind of air we breathe. Man can live

weeks without food, days without water, but only minutes without air
