America has become addicted to sugar. The average per person consumption in

the U.S. is almost 135 pounds a year! Americans may be thought of as meat and potato

eaters, but the average per person consumption of red meat is only 111 pounds per year,

and of potatoes only 123 pounds per year.

Increasingly more Americans, however, are becoming aware of the danger in sugar

consumption; and for some time now, the public has been exploring sweet alternatives.

How safe are these artificial sweeteners? We are al familiar with the fact that some of

these artificial sweeteners have been associated with cancer. I wil merely give current

information on one of these sweeteners.



SWEETENER LINKED TO CONFUSION AND MEMORY LOSS



Aspartame, the artificial sweetener widely used in diet soda and food, may cause

confusion and memory loss in some people. This finding came from a study of 551 people

who had severe reactions to aspartame, which is marketed under the brand name of

NutraSweet. HJ. Roberts, director of the Palm Beach Institute for Medical Research in

Florida, found that 157 of the participants had major problems. Eleven lost vision in one or

both eyes; one-third suffered from severe dizziness; half reported severe headaches. One

18 year-old male, who drank about two quarts of aspartame-sweetened diet soda daily,

could not find his way home in his own neighborhood. Severe reactions to the sweetener

occurred three times more often in women. Although the Food and Drug Administration

has received hundreds of complaints about aspartame from consumers, no adequate

studies have been conducted. (New Scientist, 2/18/88).



WHAT CAN WE USE THEN INSTEAD OF SUGAR?

Use natural sugar just as the Good Lord put it in the food, such as fresh peaches,

strawberries, cherries, watermelon, etc. A more concentrated natural sugar would be

found in dates, figs, raisins, dried fruits, honey, etc.

TESTIMONIALS TO

NATURAL HEALTH LIFESTYLE



At every session of our lifestyle center we were thril ed to see lives changed to the

glory of God; we saw individuals make an about face in their lifestyle, and begin their

journey on the path of abundant health and happiness. At the end of every session our

guests testified to the value of our program in their lives. Many of them write testimonials

which are published in our newsletters. The fol owing stories are about some of these

guests who have given permission to print their stories. However, to protect their privacy,

the names have been changed.



FORMER LIFESTYLE GUEST DISCONTINUES HIS DAILY 125 MG. OF

MORPHINE.



Len Dyer (not his real name) and his wife attended our 26- day lifestyle session.

Len came to us with an advanced stage of prostate cancer. In the past, Len had

undergone surgery, radiation and chemotherapy and there was nothing more the doctors

could do except give him morphine for the pain. For the past year Len had been taking

125 mg. of morphine daily. Len's wife had contacted me by phone and I had started Len

on our program while he was at home as we couldn't take him immediately.

With the skil ful use of God's eight natural remedies of fresh air, pure soft water,

natural food, rest, exercise, sunshine, temperance, and trust in God, Len was able to

completely discontinue his morphine. Slowly his strength and digestion improved and

thoughts became clearer. He stil had some bad days but overal he was improving.

After his stay here, he went home looking and feeling much better. We I decided to

cal him and see how he was doing. It had been over six weeks since we had talked to

him. He is stil not using any morphine and is slowly recovering with occasional bad days.

Len is thankful he had the opportunity to attend one of our sessions and learn the natural

ways to good health.



RONALD'S STORY



Ronald Flood (not his real name) from Puerto Rico attended our 26-day lifestyle

session. After hearing about our program from a friend who was a previous client. Ronald

was a successful businessman and the owner of 10 jewelry stores; but now at the age of

48, major health problems brought him seeking relief to our center.

Until 11/2 years ago, Ronald had been a heavy drinker. He had undergone a gal

bladder operation, and was having liver problems. He was retaining fluid, especial y in his

feet. His arms and legs would fal asleep at night; and he had swel ing of the lymph glands

in his neck. Ronald also had real problems with digestion, having only two or three bowel

movements a week. He always felt tired, and realized he needed help.

Ronald was accustomed to eating lots of meat, and drinking lots of milk, coffee,

colas, and tea; but he readily accepted his new pure vegetarian diet. This diet, high in



169

fresh fruits and vegetables, permitted no meats, milk, eggs, sugar, oil, baking powder, or

soda, preservatives, or chemicals.

At the end of the 26 day session, Ronald felt like a new man. He felt so good, and

had so much energy, that during his stay he walked 65 1/2 miles, biked 10 miles, and

helped us here with mowing the lawn, washing windows, etc. His arms and legs no longer

fel asleep at night; and he was no longer retaining fluid. The swel ing in his lymph glands

was gone, and his digestion problems were over, He was having two bowel movements

daily now instead of the previous two or three a week. He lost 91/2 pounds, and he had a

blood pressure reading of 98/58, and a pulse of 68.

Before leaving us, Ronald told us that he was going to sel his jewelry stores, and

possibly open up a health food store or bakery; he wanted to share with others how to

become healthy.



ARTYâ€™S STORY



The phone rang in the office, and we hurried to answer it. We were between

sessions and already almost booked to capacity. This time the cal er was a woman from

overseas would I have space for her husband who was desperately il ? As we talked with

her we learned that he had been diagnosed with cancer and was very discouraged. We

assured her that there was space, and thus Artie and his wife Joan (not their regular

names) became a part of our next family group here at the center.

Through other cal s from friends of Arty's who had attended our lifestyle sessions

we learned a little more about him. Arty, we were told, used to be a robust, active man

with a cheery disposition and an outgoing personality. Diagnosed with cancer, he had

recently returned from attending a different lifestyle center here in the United States. He

was fol owing a good health plan, and should be improving, yet he seemed instead to be

getting worse. His friends said that he was losing weight at an alarming rate.

Our first meeting with Artie and his wife confirmed what our cal ers had said. Artie

was very depressed; he seemed fearful, discouraged, and uncertain about the program he

was fol owing. We assured him that the program was accurate, and proceeded to counsel

him and give him therapy. He immediately joined our other session guests in our program

of exercise and diet as described throughout the pages of this book. Artie and his wife left

our center different people: Artie had gained weight; his cheery smile had returned; his

painful symptoms had disappeared; and he was testifying to the goodness of God. One

year later, he is stil improving, and has returned to his usual program of activity, faithful y

fol owing the natural lifestyle program.

VACCINATIONS



Should we take vaccinations? The answer is no! Vaccinations are not a natural

way to stay healthy. Vaccinations are a disease-producing process, which results in injury

to the bodyÅ› organs, nervous system, blood stream, etc. The immunization program has

been based on PasteurÅ› germ theory. It is frequently overlooked that Pasteur changed

his thinking before his death.



VACCINATIONS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE



Vaccine making is an ever changing and highly experimental process. Even the

vaccine manufactures admit that vaccines are unpredictable in their effects, unstable in

nature, and are unreliable in use, and never safe. Consequently, no one real y knows just

what is being shot into his or her arm, and what it wil do. One shot could possibly cause

sudden death, paralysis, lockjaw, brain-damage, or in some cases there may be no

reaction at al for months or years. The one administering the shot never tel s you what is

in the vaccine. In fact, many doctors do not even know what chemicals, drugs or other

dangerous substances are in the vaccine serums. Lets take a close look at just four of the

many vaccines that are being used today.
