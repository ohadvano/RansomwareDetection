FRESH FOOD IS BEST



In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve ate only fresh

fruits, nuts and grains. Eve didn't use a stove or microwave to

prepare Adam's meals. For one to have good health, a

minimum of 50% of our daily food intake should be raw foods.

Raw food is live food; cooked food is dead food. Have you

noticed how few fresh raw fruits and vegetables the average

person consumes?



Food processing, refining, cooking, and more recently,

the advent of microwaving, destroys the enzymes in the live

food we eat. These enzyme deficient foods cause imbalances

in our bodies, which in turn cause disease.



The biggest difference between live (raw) food and dead

(cooked) food is enzymatic activity and something I cal the life force. If you were to take

two seeds, boil one of them, and then put them both in the ground, which one do you think

would grow? The unboiled one would grow because the enzymes and the life force are

stil alive. Cooking stops enzymatic action and destroys the life force.



Enzymes are said to be protein molecules, and each enzyme acts in certain ways

in the body, doing specific jobs. Enzymes digest al our food. There are over 100,000

enzyme particles in a single drop of blood. They take digested food and build it into blood,

nerves, muscles, and glands. Enzymes assist in storing sugar in the liver and muscles.

There is an enzyme that builds phosphorus into bone and nerve tissue. Once we cook

food above 118 degrees, al the enzymes present in the food are completely destroyed,

and are no longer able to perform their designated function. Although the physical protein

molecule is stil present, it has lost its life force. Like a flashlight battery that has lost its

power, the physical structure remains, but the electrical energy is no longer present.



A protein molecule is actual y only the carrier of enzyme activity. In experiments

described in "Chemical Review", the activity of our protein molecule was transferred over

to another protein substance, leaving the original molecule devoid of its original activity(1).

This only proves further that an enzyme is the invisible activity or energy factor, and not

just the protein molecule itself.



Enzymes are needed for every chemical action and reaction in the body. Our

organs, tissues, and cel s are al run by metabolic enzymes. Minerals, vitamins, and

hormones need enzymes to be present in order to do their work properly. Enzymes are

the labor force of the body. Enzymes are involved in every metabolic process our immune

system, blood stream, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, etc.. Enzymes break down toxic

substances so that the body can eliminate them without damaging the eliminative

organs(2). Since 1968, thirteen hundred enzymes have been identified.

A diet high in cooked food lacks the enzymes that are in fresh food, and causes the

endocrine glands to become overworked, thus encouraging the development of diseases

such as hypoglycemia and obesity.

Enzymes may be divided into two groups, those found in raw food, and those

produced within our bodies. The more enzymes one gets from the raw food, the less that

wil have to be borrowed from other metabolic processes and supplied by the pancreas. It



112

is important to realize that the enzymes in raw food actual y digest 50% to 75% of the food

itself without the help of the enzymes secreted by the body. Nature has placed enzymes in

food to aid in the digestive process instead of forcing the body's enzymes to do al the

work. It is to be remembered that we inherited an enzyme reserve at birth, and this

quantity can be decreased as we age by eating an enzyme deficient diet. By eating most

of our food cooked, our digestive system has to produce al of the enzymes, thus causing

an enlargement of the digestive organs, especial y the pancreas. It also places a drain on

the body's immune system.

An experiment was performed at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago in relation to

saliva and its enzyme content. The younger group (aged 21 to 31) was found to have 30

times more amylase (an enzyme) in their saliva than those in the older group (aged over

69).(3)

In conclusion, this information is tel ing us that we need to eat more fresh fruits and

vegetables. Our diet should consist of at least 50% fresh food. We should eat our fresh

salads, etc., at the beginning of our meal. They are bulky and wil give us a more ful

feeling, helping us not to overeat cooked food. As one gets older, the intake of fresh food

should be increased to even more than 50%, since our bodies are more deficient of

enzymes. Investigations show that in warm temperatures, enzymes are used up more

rapidly than in cool temperatures. Additional fresh foods are therefore needed during the

summer months, and for those who live in the southern United States.

HEADACHES





There are many different types of headaches: tension headaches, migraine headaches,

al ergic headaches, etc. One may have a mild or severe headache, or the pain may be

frontal or toward the back of the head. It may be a dul aching pain, or an almost

unbearable pain. It may be an intermittent intense pain, a throbbing pain, a pressure pain,

or a penetrating pain.

A headache is not a disease, but a symptom, showing that something else is

wrong in the body and needs to be taken care of. A headache is like the red engine

warning light on the dashboard of your car. If you ignore the warning light when it comes

on, you won't get very far down the road before your car engine wil stop running. If you

ignore a headache,(which is a built-in warning device), your body wil also stop functioning

properly.



When a person has a headache his body is trying to tel him that something is

wrong. He may be constipated, or not getting enough sleep, or eating the wrong kind of

foods, or under too much stress, or not drinking enough water, or breathing poisonous air,

or taking the wrong medications, etc. It is sometimes hard to find the cause of headaches,

so one needs to look

very careful y at his lifestyle and be wil ing to make any necessary changes.



Monosodium glutamate (MSG) may also cause headaches in sensitive individuals.

Many who read food labels are unaware that MSG may be listed as "flavoring," "natural

flavoring," or hydrolized vegetable protein." Hydrolyzed vegetable protein may be 10-30%

MSG. (Headache 31:107-110, 1991)

Three of the major causes of headaches are constipation, dehydration, and stress.

When one is constipated, the waste material in the colon spoils and becomes putrefied

from being in the body too long. The blood capil aries to the colon begin to pick up the

toxins and poisons that are in the colon. These enter the blood stream (causing many



114

problems), and are carried to al parts of the body, including the brain where one develops

a headache. Two factors that wil improve constipation are drinking plenty of water, and

eating natural foods. Leave refined concentrated foods alone (there is no food more

constipating than cheese).

Not drinking enough water is another major cause of headaches. The human brain

is composed of over 80% water, and when a person doesn't drink enough water, they wil

have headaches. Everyone should drink at least two quarts of water daily. Stress is

another major cause of tension headaches. Two physical things we can do for tension

headaches are soaking in a bathtub of lukewarm water for a half hour, and drinking red

sage tea, which is excel ent for tension headaches.



Some other simple ways to relieve headaches are to take a hot foot bath with plain

water or with a tablespoon of mustard seed in it, and place a cold compress to the head

for 20 minutes. Two other herb teas that are good for headaches are peppermint and

black cohosh. Black cohosh is especial y good for severe headaches and congestion in

the head

In conclusion, remember that headaches are merely the body's warning signal that

something is wrong. Living natural y and healthful y, and learning to take handle our

burdens wil eliminate many of the stressful situations in our lives, and help us to deal with

those that do come in a calm way that wil minimize headaches.

HEART DISEASE





There are over 4,000 heart attacks every day in America. 50% of al deaths in the

U.S. are from cardiovascular disease. That is a ratio of 1 out of every 2 Americans.
