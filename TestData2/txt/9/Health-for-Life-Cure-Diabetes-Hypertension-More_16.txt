it. Those who work 20 years or more around noisy equipment have a life span 5 years

shorter than those working in quieter areas of the same firm. Television almost

consistently raises the stress hormone level in the blood regardless of the programming.

Rock music has also been shown to affect the body's stress level adversely.





HOW MUCH SLEEP DO WE NEED?

The requirement for sleep varies with age. A baby sleeps most of the time. A young

child before the age of 6 needs about 14 hours of sleep per day. A

grade school child needs at least twelve hours, and a teenager should

have from nine to ten hours of sleep per day. This much sleep is not

necessary for older individuals, but it is for young people. The adult

needs only to repair the daily waste of tissue, whereas the young

requires in addition much energy for growth and development.

Nevertheless, statistics show that good sleepers amongst the aged are

those who live longest. Sleep requirements may temporarily change. During il ness,

pregnancy or stress, a person may need more sleep.

When anxieties, cares and business perplexities are carried to bed, sleep during

the early hours is not refreshing and the time of sleep is necessarily extended. The

occupation during the day likewise regulates the amount of sleep at night. Brain workers,

and those undergoing severe nervous strains, require considerable sleep: their fatigue is

mental and nervous, and sleep is the only form of rest that is beneficial. People who are

doing manual labor, usual y fail to sleep readily upon retiring and don't require as many

hours of sleep.





STAGES OF SLEEP

Sleep is classified into two distinct states, Rapid Eye Movement (R.E.M.) is the first

state and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (N.R.E.M.) is the second state which accounts for

about 75% of the normal sleep. N.R.E.M. is divided into four

states. Stage 1 of N.R.E.M. sleep is a light sleep and a person

is easily awakened during this stage. Stage 2 of N.R.E.M. is a

deeper sleep with heart and respiratory rates slowing and the

temperature dropping. Stage 3 of N.R.E.M. begins 20 to 40

minutes after onset of sleep and the body processes continue to

slow down. Stage 4 begins about 10 minutes later; this is the

deepest sleep, and anyone awakened during this stage wil be

temporarily confused.



Within an hour or so of fal ing asleep, the sleeper rapidly progresses through three

stages until he gets to the deep sleep stage, then they reverse until he gets back to the

light stage. This first sleep cycle (stages 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, and REM) are completed 70-80



51



minutes after fal ing asleep. This complete cycle is repeated four to five times a night. The

second cycle usual y lasts about 110 minutes and the third cycle about 120 minutes, but

the later cycles are shorter, approximately 90 minutes each.

This is why sometimes in the middle of the night you wake up (you're in the light

stage) and it takes you some time to fal back to sleep. If the phone rings and wakes you

up during the first stage, the light stage, you are alert, but if the phone rings and wakes

you up during stage 4, the deep stage, it takes you a while to get your thoughts together.

Some individuals, awakened during the deep stage, answer the phone and the next

morning don't even remember they had a phone cal during the night.

NATURAL WAYS TO HELP ONE SLEEP

. Only those who use their muscles during the day in physical work can enjoy sweet

sleep at night. If you are a sedentary worker, then in the evening spend at least one hour

outside, go for a walk, mow the lawn, wash the car, work in the garden, paint the garage,

etc;, do some physical work before going to bed.

Regularity is important for good sleep patterns. Arising at the same

time every morning wil assist one in fal ing asleep at the same time every

night. Going to bed at an early hour wil greatly benefit one's health. It

has been observed that the body's temperature and vitality is at its lowest

ebb about 2 A.M. and for this reason every hour of sleep before midnight

is worth two hours; and every hour after midnight is worth one. Sleeping in

on weekends disrupts the clock, causing difficulties in sleeping.

Tobacco, caffeine (as found in coffee, tea, colas) chocolate, sugar, fatty foods,

chemical preservatives, additives, etc. can stimulate the body causing insomnia. It is true

that food puts you to sleep at first, by diverting the blood from the head; but it disturbs

sleep later in the night. When you eat a large meal before going to bed, the food has to be

digested and the stomach fails to get its proper rest. The sleep is disturbed, the brain and

nerves are wearied, the appetite for breakfast is impaired and the whole system is

unrefreshed and is unready for the day's duties. If you go to bed with an empty stomach,

you can often get along wel with six or seven hours sleep: but if you go to bed after a big

meal, you usual y need from eight to ten hours sleep.



Plenty of fresh air in the sleeping room is an important part of the rejuvenating

effect of sleep. Your body is working less, and the air you breathe is used to restore and

rebuild body tissue. Therefore, be sure there is a current of outdoor air (even in the winter)

entering your room while you sleep. If you do not have fresh air at night, you wil tend to

awake tired and exhausted.

Neutral temperature baths, between 92 - 95 degrees, for 10 minutes or more are

excel ent for relaxing and calming the mind, and preparing one for sleep. Herb tea made

from either hops or catnip wil usual y help one to sleep. Bring 8 oz. of distil ed water to a

boil, turn the heat off, add 1-1/2 tsp. of herb and let steep for 20 minutes. Strain and drink

it one half hour before bedtime.

The most healthful position for sleeping is upon the right side with the limbs

extended as much as possible. This position avoids pressure upon the heart, keeps the

heavy liver (which is the largest organ in the body), downward, and affords the stomach

the ful est freedom. While lying upon the side, the pil ow should be of sufficient size to

keep the head in its natural relationship to the shoulders. You should not use more than

one pil ow. The object is to get in the correct position so that the spine is straight. Contrary

to popular belief, the mattress should not be firm, but fairly soft. The best type of mattress

is a foam mattress, or one can use a firm mattress with a thin egg crate mattress on top.

RECREATION IS A FORM OF REST



Recreation is a vitalized form of rest. A change of activity is needed from time to

time. We need variety in our lives; that is why it's good to get away from the normal routine

occasional y, such as a weekend trip to the mountains, or sea shore camping with the

family. Eating good natural food cooked over a campfire, sleeping in the great out of

doors, getting plenty of fresh air, being away from al the traffic noises such as sirens,

relaxing and enjoying the birds singing, soaking up the sun, or going for a swim in the

ocean or lake are various ways to rest and relax.

The great out of doors was created for us to enjoy; the only problem is that we don't

take advantage of it often enough. It is sad to say but

many people never take time off from their busy

schedules to enjoy the finer things in life. Our

American society is too materialistic; they want to

acquire more and more, and then have to spend

most of their time maintaining and taking care of al

their belongings which have entrapped them. I now

live in Central America and the people have very little

in regards to material possessions. The average

wage of a common worker living in Nicaragua is

$2.00 a day. But I have noticed something unusual:

most of the Nicaraguan people are happy. I have since come to the conclusion that the

more you have, the unhappier you are; and the less you have, the happier you are. Maybe

we here in America have our priorities turned around. After al , if many material things

don't make you happy, then why have so many?

EXERCISE IS FOR EVERY BODY





In the biological world purposeful movement is life: inactivity is death. Action is a law of

our being, and body functions must be kept going. More people rust out than wear out.

The medical practice has been slow in recognizing this fact.



Early in this century if a woman went to the hospital to have her baby, she would

probably be kept there for four weeks; today, a mother is permitted to walk off the delivery

table if she wants to. In fact, she is encouraged to walk right after delivery.



Physicians are now prescribing exercise as part of the program for speeding up the

recovery of surgical and maternity patients, thus preventing blood clotting, kidney stones

and loss of calcium from the bones of bed patients.
