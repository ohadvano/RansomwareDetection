TUB BATH TO LOWER FEVERS

If one has a fever of approximately 102 degrees F., then put them in a tub of water

with a temperature of about 98 degrees F., and this wil bring the fever down. Never put

them in a tub of real cold water as this wil drive the blood from the limbs of the body

toward the trunk of the body and wil cause congestion of the blood.

These are just a few of the simple natural ways to use water external y to improve

health. For more information on this subject, I highly recommend the book Home

Remedies, by Drs. Calvin and Agatha Thrash, published by New Lifestyle Books, Seale,

AL., 36875.

SUNSHINE, NATURE'S HEALER





Sunlight is one of nature's healing agents. It takes 8 minutes for the sun's rays to

reach the earth. Fifty-four percent of the light reaching the earth is invisible. Forty-nine

percent is infrared light and 4.6 percent ultraviolet. The visible light reaching the earth

accounts for 46 percent.



Invisible Ultra Violet Light

Throughout most of recorded history man has lived and worked out of doors with

fÃ¼l exposure to sunlight. In our modern society today, mil ions live in the cities, working

indoors in factories and offices. We live in a glass environment, where the larger portion of

the day is spent behind window glass, which keeps out the ultraviolet light that is so

healing to the body. Fluorescent and incandescent light is used in our offices, schools,

and factories. This light source is entirely different from the kind that comes from natural

sunlight.



Ful , direct natural sunlight ranges as high as 10,000 foot candles while the

maximum intensity from a fluorescent fixture containing ten 8 foot tubes is only

approximately 1,000 foot candles at a distance of 10-12 inches.



SUNLIGHT'S ABILITY TQ STRENGTHEN THE BODYâ€™S IMMUNE SYSTEM

It is now believed that disease can only occur when one fails to maintain the

delicate balance of power between one's body and the organisms that produce disease.

This is so, for we find people who are carrying within themselves the germs capable of

causing an infection and yet they are apparently free of disease. Their body's immune

System is strong enough to keep these organisms from growing and

developing.

Studies have shown that exposure to natural sunlight increases

the number of white blood cel s in the human blood. The white blood



27



cel that increases the most is the lymphocyte, which is the one that plays a leading role in

defending the body against an invasion of germs.

Because the lymphocytes increase in number after a sunlight treatment, antibodies,

their products of defense, also increase in the blood (1) Ultraviolet light also has an effect

on the deep internal organs. The pancreas, stomach, liver, kidneys, and adrenal glands

are apparently benefited by sun light treatments seemingly due to the Stimulation of the

sympathetic nervous System.



SUNSHINE FIGHTS CANCER

Sunlight is able to speed up the body's metabolism to eliminate toxic poisons the

body has accumulated. The ultraviolet light would help to remove

them. Thus by aiding in the removal of many cancer-causing

agents, sunlight is able to reduce the incidence of cancer.(2)

Studies show that as the amount of available sunlight increases,

the incidence of internal cancer decreases. The total cancer

deaths of the various American states and Canadian provinces

are shown to fal with increasing available sunlight (3)

Sunlight increases the use of oxygen in the tissues. This can be very important in

stimulating the immune System especial y in the production of antibodies. Many types of

cancer cel s do not like oxygen, and when exposed to high concentrations they wil begin

to slow their growth and division, final y stopping completely (4) In this indirect way, sunlight

can fight against cancer, stimulating the immune System and increasing the oxygen in the

tissues.

In humans, the evidence that light is involved with cancer is coming into focus.

When the pineal gland in humans becomes calcified, it cuts down its production of

melatonin. This, in turn, stimulates the production of estrogen, which causes an increased

amount of breast cancer. Over 60% of Americans have calcified pineal glands when they

are over 50 years of age, while in Japan only 9.9% and in Nigeria 5% of the persons

beyond the age of 40 have calcified glands. Since the incidence of breast cancer is low in

Japan and South Africa and high in North America, it would appear, according to Dr.

Kirne, M. D. that calcified pineals are associated with an increased incidence of breast

cancer. The reasons why the pineal gland becomes calcified remain obscure. The low-

light intensity that the human eye receives while indoors combined with the lack of

Stimulation of the pineal gland, may be factors contributing to calcification of the pineal

gland.(5)



CAN SUNLIGHT CAUSE CANCER?

Some humans are very sensitive to sunlight and wil burn easily. Blond and red

haired persons seem to be most troubled with chronic burning. Skin cancer patients

appear to be very sensitive to sunlight. They sunburn more easily and the burned area

takes longer to heal. They also have a harder time tanning. The current medical concept

pictures a destructive sun, one responsible for aging of the skin and capable of causing

skin cancer. Research stemming from this concept provides Information on the sun and its

relation to human health. Undeniably, the sun plays a role in skin cancer and aging, but is

it the primary contributor?

Dr. Zane Kirne, M. D., author of Sunlight Could Save Your Life, became

increasingly convinced as he studied the available research data, that the highly refined

western diet, particularly that of refined oils, plays the leading role in the development of

skin cancer, and that sunlight seems only to accelerate the problem. The intake of salad

and cooking oils has increased dramatical y since 1909 when oils were consumed at the



28

rate of 1.5 pounds per person per year. By 1972, this figure had risen to18 Ibs. Now today,

it is over 58 Ibs. per person. There is little doubt, in the research literature, as to whether

or not a high fat diet promotes a higher and earlier incidence of skin cancer due to

ultraviolet light. Not only skin cancer, but breast and colon cancer as wel , seem to be

increased by a high fat diet (6) Not only does saturated fat stimulate cancer formation, but

unsaturated or polyunsaturated fat wil do the same in many cases. In scientific literature,

the polyunsaturated fats are shown to apparently stimulate cancer formation more quickly

than do the saturated fats.(7)

Nutrition and sunlight are intimately related. Sunshine on the skin produces certain

hormones and nutrients like Vitamin D. Unless one has a proper diet, sunlight has an il

effect on the skin. This must be emphasized: sun bathing is dangerous for those who are

on the Standard high-fat American diet (which is 45% fat) or who do not get an abundance

of vegetables, whole grains, and fresh fruits. It is not only the dietary fat that promotes skin

cancer formation, but also fat of oil applied directly to the skin. This is why sun bathing

lotions, creams, or oils cannot be recommended, for they may stimulate cancer formation.

Polyunsaturated fat, itself has been shown to inhibit the immune System. In fact, it does

this so wel that researchers are now using polyunsaturated fat in the diets of kidney

transplant patients and those with skin grafts taken from other people, so the patientÅ›

bodies wil not reject the foreign tissue.



SUNSHINE LOWERS CHOLESTEROL

Cholesterol is a substance that can only be found in meat, poultry, fish, and animal

products such as eggs, milk, and cheese. Cholesterol is not found in fruits, vegetables,

nuts, grains, etc. Our bodies manufacture cholesterol from fats, oils, sugars, and proteins.

Cholesterol is a member of the steroid family. This family is a group of substances that are

similar in their molecular structure, but very different in their effects on the body. It is

important to understand that vitamin D and cholesterol are in the steroid family. It was in

1904 that one research scientist discovered that sunlight was able to transform cholesterol

to Vitamin D. Human skin has a very rich supply of cholesterol, and this cholesterol keeps

moving back and forth between the skin and the blood stream. If it is removed from the

skin, then the cholesterol from the blood stream moves into the skin to replace the

cholesterol that was lost.

It has been found that not only does sunlight cause a prompt and significant
