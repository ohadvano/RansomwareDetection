It is general y recommended that a sedentary person drink a minimum of eight, 8

oz. glasses of water a day, which would be two quarts. If you are

overweight, then you need more, a smal child

would need less. There is a simple formula one

can use to know how much water they need.

Take your weight divide it into half and that is how

many ounces of water you need. Of course, if

you are working out in the hot sun and sweating

profusely you would need considerably more. One simple test to know if you are drinking

enough water is that if your urine is pale with very little odor you are getting enough water.

If your urine is dark with a bad odor, you need to drink more water. The only exception to

this would be someone who is taking medicine which wil often color the urine. Many

people do not like water; they would rather drink coffee, tea, cocoa, soft drinks, alcohol,

etc. which are harmful to the body. These things should be eliminated; they are not

natural. If the good Lord wanted us to drink these He would rain them from the sky. Pure

soft water is the very best liquid for our body; there is nothing better. Water is the principal

chemical constituent of the human body, comprising approximately 65% of the body

weight of an adult male, and 55% of the adult female. When we do not drink enough water

our blood thickens and flows with greater difficulty (causing blood pressure to rise). This

can cause trouble not only in your body tissues and organs, but also to your heart as it

must pump this thicker blood to al parts of the body.

Water is the most transient of any element taken into the body. It is eliminated four

ways: namely, lungs, skin, kidneys and intestines. Drinking adequate amounts of water

helps remove from the blood its foulest materials, rendering the blood cleaner for the

building up of tissues, and better health.



WE LOSE APPROXIMATELY THREE QUARTS OF WATER DAILY

Our bodies lose on the average of 3 quarts of water every day. Each

time we blink our eyes, we lose water. Every time we breathe our bodies

lose water. Blow on a mirror, and observe the moisture; this came from

your lungs. A sedentary person wil sweat approximately 2 glasses of water

a day. By drinking two quarts of water a day and getting the other quart

from the food we eat (an apple is 83% water), we wil be replacing the

water we lose each day. It would require 2500 gal ons of water a day (that's

40,000 glasses) to keep the body organs functioning properly, if the body

didn't have a unique method of conserving fluids. This is done by our kidneys which are a

marvelous filtering system. Our kidneys weigh between 4-6 oz. each, are about 4-1/2



23





inches long and 2-3 inches wide, and they process an amount of blood equivalent to al

that is in the human body (about five quarts) every four to five minutes. These smal filters

know exactly what substances to let pass by, and then they reabsorb the fluid after the

poisons are passed on to the bladder as urine. The kidneys excrete one to one-and-a-half

quarts of urine each day if the body is receiving enough water (8 or more glasses a day).



WHEN SHOULD WE DRINK WATER?

The very best time for drinking your water is to drink two or more glasses first thing

upon arising in the morning. We should never drink water with our meals as it wil dilute

the hydrochloric acid in the stomach. The diluted hydrochloric acid wil have a harder time

breaking down the food, causing the food to stay in the stomach

longer, and causing indigestion, ulcers, etc. We should wait at least

one hour after we eat before drinking water and no sooner than 15

minutes before we eat. It is also not advisable to drink real hot or real

cold water or liquids of any kind as these extremes are debilitating to

the stomach. Water is needed to help regulate our temperatures. Our

skin covers approximately 3,000 sq. inches and receives one third of

al the blood circulating in the body. The way it regulates our body heat

is by opening the blood vessels and also by cooling itself by the mil ions of sweat glands in

our skin. If you are working out in the hot sun al day long you can lose over two quarts of

water through the skin by perspiring.

Water is also a lubricant - preventing friction between the body's joints and

muscles. During manual labor, the body is stretched, twisted, and bent in ways that

wouldn't be possible if water wasn't present, such as in the fluid that surrounds the knee.





LACK OF WATER CAN CAUSE THESE HEALTH PROBLEMS

Our brain is approximately 90% water. When we do not drink enough water our

brain becomes dehydrated and we can get a headache. There have been patients

admitted to the hospital, who were so far off in their thinking that their family had thought

they had a nervous breakdown. Upon checking them over, their doctors

found them to be dehydrated. By simply giving them fluids (water and

salt mixture) their mental problems disappeared within a matter of

hours.

Our blood is 78% water and one of its functions is to carry away

the waste materials in the body. If a person doesn't drink enough water

the blood becomes thicker with a higher concentration of waste

materials in the blood stream, and as it circulates through the brain it

can cause headaches. It can also cause a burning sensation during the act of voiding as

the urine is very strong from the lack of water in the urinary tract. This strong

concentration of waste materials can also cause kidney stones and kidney and bladder

infections.

One of the most important things to remember about water is the effect upon your

heart and bloodstream from drinking insufficient water. Dehydration

thickens the blood and puts a strain on the circulatory system. This can

cause high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes. If you want a healthy

heart, drink plenty of water to keep your blood stream free flowing.

Constipation is another problem caused many times by a lack of



24

insufficient water. The fecal matter in the large colon should be moist and soft; but if you

are not drinking enough water the body wil reabsorb this impure water from the fecal

matter, making it hard and causing constipation and hemorrhoids. Lack of water can also

cause swel ing of the ankles, psoriasis of the skin, eye problems, fatigue, etc.

Most al of us are very conscious of our outward appearance to the extent that we

bathe regularly, wear clean clothes and smel nice, but what about the inside of our

bodies? Just as it takes water on the outside of our bodies to keep them clean, it is even

more important to use plenty of water on the inside to keep us clean. A person who has a

body ful of accumulated waste wil not have good health. So for optimum health drink a

sufficient amount of water everyday.



HOW DO WE USE WATER

EXTERNALLY (HYDROTHERAPY) TO

HEAL THE BODY?



DAILY BATHING FOR OPTIMUM HEALTH

The external application of water is one of the easiest and most satisfactory ways of

cleansing the body and regulating the circulation of the blood. A warm bath opens the

pores of the skin and helps in the elimination of impurities. Both warm and neutral baths

soothe the nerves and equalize the circulation. The skin has mil ions of pores from which

flow constantly a stream of poisons that are left on the skin. If the person doesn't bathe

often, these poisons wil continue to accumulate and cause many health problems. Note: If

the underclothes are not changed daily, the impurities that are on the clothes wil be

reabsorbed by the pores of the skin; thus they are taken back into the blood stream, and

these impurities put an extra load on the internal organs of elimination sometimes causing

infections and sickness.



COOL BATH OR SHOWER VERY STIMULATING

Most people would receive tremendous benefits from a cool or tepid bath or shower

every day. It wil improve one's circulation by bringing the blood to the surface. It is also

very invigorating to the body; and after you dry off, you feel terrific.



MOIST HEATING THROAT COMPRESS

A cold wet cotton cloth is placed around the neck, then covered very wel with a dry

flannel cloth to prevent air circulation. The body wil heat this wet cloth up and you have a

mild prolonged application of moist heat. The best time to do this is in the evening just

before you go to bed, leave it on al night, and remove it in the morning. The compress wil

be dry by then. As soon as you remove the compress, rub the neck with a cloth wrung out

of cold water. This compress is very good for sore throats, hoarseness, tonsilitis,

laryngitis, eustachian tube inflammation, etc. This compress can also be used on a

swol en knee, elbow, etc.



HOT AND COLD FOOT BATH

Simply fil two large containers. Fil one with hot water and the other with ice water.

Then immerse the feet first in the hot water for 3 minutes, then in the ice water for 1

minute. Do this three times in each and finish in the ice water. This alternate hot and cold

foot bath is very good for improving circulation to the feet, for helping to remove fluid

retention in the feet, for those with a cold or low grade fever, etc. The alternate hot and

cold wil increase the body's white blood cel count, which wil help build the body's

immune system, and improve your general health. This hot and cold bath can also be
