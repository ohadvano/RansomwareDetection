lowering of the body's immune system. This wil eventual y lead to pathological changes in

the joints and tissues of the body.



RECOVERY

Therefore, the first step in an effective program of helping one with arthritis is

helping the person with their psychological or emotional problems and helping them adopt

a complete change of nutritional patterns. Arthritis can be conquered only by rebuilding

and restoring the general health of the arthritic. Arthritis is an over surplus of acids and



89





waste material in the body. A faulty diet fil s the system with uric acid and poisons which

the liver, kidneys, and bladder are not able to throw off.



ACID/ALKALINE BALANCE

Balanced body chemistry is of utmost importance for the maintenance of health and

correction of disease. Acidosis, or over-acidity of the body tissues is one of the basic

causes of many diseases, especial y arthritis. It is therefore vital y important that there is a

proper ratio between acid and alkaline foods in the diet. The natural ratio in a healthy

individual is 4 to 1 - four parts alkaline to one part acid, or 80% to 20%. When this ratio is

maintained, the body has a strong resistance against disease.



FRESH FRUITS & VEGETABLES

The ideal diet for arthritis is a high alkaline diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, and a

diet low in protein, using no meat or animal products, as meat is high in purines, the end

products of nucleo protein digestion. These break down to form uric acid which is harmful

to the arthritic. Animal products such as cheese, milk,

eggs, and butter are high in fat; and fats interfere with

the urinary excretion of urates, and thus should be

limited when attempting to promote excretion of uric

acid.

The alkaline action of fresh raw fruits and

vegetables helps to dissolve the accumulation of

deposits around the joints, and helps balance out the

high uric acid found in the body. Al meat and animal

products are high acid forming, and as stated earlier,

should be avoided completely. Al nuts, except for

almonds and brazil nuts, are acid forming; and al

grains are acid forming, except buckwheat and mil et.

These acid forming foods should be eaten in very limited amounts when one has arthritis.

Two very beneficial foods for arthritis are cherries and alfalfa sprouts.

Avoiding constipation is very important in al cases of sickness. If we eat three

meals a day we should have 3 eliminations per day. Most individuals who have

constipation problems are not drinking enough water. A person should drink a minimum of

two quarts of distil ed water daily. The distil ed water wil absorb many of the toxic

substances, inorganic minerals, etc. and carry them out of the body.





ASPIRIN

Aspirin is the drug which has been used longest to relieve the pain of arthritis.

Aspirin is an irritant to the stomach lining, so severe an irritant that it is not

advised for ulcer patients. Taking aspirin may cause any or al of the

fol owing: nausea, heartburn, stomach pain, deafness, dizziness, ringing in

the ears, intestinal bleeding or hemorrhaging in other parts of the body.

Aspirin destroys vitamin K, which aids in coagulation of the blood.

CORTISONE IS NOT THE ANSWER





An announcement of the discovery of cortisone was met with great joy and

excitement by doctors and arthritis sufferers. Stiff joints would become mobile and pain

free, and crippled patients would be able to walk. To mil ions of people with arthritis

around the world, cortisone held out the great promise that at last an effective remedy for

the disease had been found. But the exalted enthusiasm was replaced by cruel

disappointment. It soon became evident that "the remedy was worse than the disease".

Cortisone has caused so many toxic reactions and dangerous side effects that it is now

considered "on the way out" in the treatment of arthritis.

Instead of drugs, God has given us herbs for the healing of the body. Two herbs

that are particularly beneficial for arthritis are burdock root and black cohosh. Use these in

tea form for best results. Bring distil ed water to a boil. Remove from heat, add 1-2 tsp.

herb per 8 ounces of water and let steep 20 minutes or longer. Strain and drink.

CHOCOLATE





Last year Americans bought over 3 bil ion pounds of candy; over 55% of it was

chocolate. Over 85% of the cocoa consumed in this country is in the form of candy.

Chocolate comes from the cacao tree, a smal , beautiful tree indigenous to the

tropical regions of the world. Cacao beans are produced in pods from 6-10 inches long

when mature, varying in color from green through reds and yel ows. Each pod contains 25

- 50 beans. The average tree bears al year long but yields about 2 pounds of dried beans

per year. The pod has a white pulp which is delicious to the taste, but the seeds are bitter

and astringent. It is from the seeds that chocolate is made.



The beans are piled in the yards of the farmers where they are left to ferment, a process

which takes from three to eight days. At the peak of the fermentation the temperature may

reach 140 degrees F. The fermentation is essential for

the development of the chocolate flavor. During

fermentation the bean's own enzymes and wild yeasts

enhance the fermentation process. It has been shown

that large quantities of aflatoxin can be found in cacao

beans.(1) Aflatoxin, a cancer producing agent from molds,

is one of the most potent cancer producing agents

known. During the fermentation process, children and

adults walk over the piles, and insects (especial y

cockroaches), rodents, smal animals, and other living things make their nests in the piles

of cocoa beans. It is not practical or feasible to remove al of the dead insects and their

excreta from the cocoa beans, so a large amount ends up in your chocolate candy bar,

hot chocolate, etc.

A booklet published by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare

cal ed "The Food Defect Action Levels" lists the defect levels in chocolate in the form of

"insect, rodent, and other natural contaminants" that are al owable by the PDA. Cocoa

beans are "permitted to contain an average of 75 microscopic insect fragments per 50 gm.



92

and an average of 2 rodent hairs per 50 gm. (50 gm is approximately 3 tablespoons).

Animal excreta must not exceed 10 mil igrams per pound. Many individuals who believe

themselves to be al ergic to chocolate are in fact al ergic to the animal parts in the

chocolate.

Because of chocolate's high fat content, it can act as a carrier of salmonel a

bacteria which is a type of food poisoning characterized by nausea, vomiting, and

diarrhea. Also brand-name chocolate candy bars come contaminated with carcinogenic

weed kil ers and wood preservatives. Traces of these and other dangerous substances

were found by the independent testing laboratories of WARF Institute in five brands of top-

sel ing candy bars (although the E.P.A. safety levels supposedly do not permit any of

these to be present).



Chocolate contains Theobromine, Theophylline and Caffeine, with the principal one

being Theobromine which can cause abnormal gland growth, central nervous system

stimulation, sleeplessness, depression and anxiety. Theobromine salts are known to

cause upset stomach, flushing of the skin with a warm sensation and itching. Theophylline

can cause irritation of the stomach, with discomfort, nausea and vomiting, as wel as

stimulation of the central nervous system. Caffeine is classified by the pharmacology tests

as a "central nervous system stimulant". A fatal dose of caffeine is 10 grams, the amount

in about 70 cups of coffee.

Would you use chocolate, drink coffee, colas, etc. or use caffeine containing

products (see chart) if you knew they were going to slow you down? Anything with

caffeine in it is considered a stimulant. If you use stimulants, keep this basic concept in

mind: what goes up must come down. The person who has to rely on products containing

caffeine has created a seesaw existence which finds him on top of a mountain or down in

a val ey, with fatigue as his constant companion. Stimulants, such as caffeine, give us

energy without giving us adequate fuel. Stimulants increase nearly al vital body functions.

Chocolate is very harmful to one's body and can cause a long list of health

problems. Listed below are some of these problems:



â€¢ Increased heart rate and force of contraction,

â€¢ high blood pressure and temporary irregular

â€¢ heart beat (2)

â€¢ Stomach disorders and diarrhea

â€¢ Increased kidney and bladder action
