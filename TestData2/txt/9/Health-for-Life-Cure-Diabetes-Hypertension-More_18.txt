

Exercise wil help osteoporosis. Bone is living, dynamic tissue composed of a

meshwork of gelatinous protein cal ed col agen (from which gelatin can be made) in which

the mineral salts of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium are held.(2) If you want your

bones to be dense and strong, you must continue to be active. Inactivity causes bones to

lose minerals and become weak, causing osteoporosis. Astronauts on space flights lose

minerals but as soon as their mission ends and they begin to exercise again, the loss is

restored. This restoration however does not equal the amount lost.



EXERCISE HELPS RELIEVE STRESS AND ANXIETY





According to Diana Kenepp, academic athletic counselor at Penn State University,

"During periods of high stress, the body builds up hormones and

other chemicals in the blood. Exercise dissipates these and

induces a period of deep physical and emotional relaxation that

sets in ninety minutes after a vigorous workout. Exercise aids in

the production and circulation of endorphins (happy hormones) in

the bloodstream. Endorphins reduce anxiety, stimulate immune-

system response, and contribute to a feeling of wel -being that

also helps combat feelings of stress. "Physiologists point out the beneficial effects of

physical activity. Exercise is said to be an outlet for unconsumed accumulated energy,

and so reduces "free floating tension" and channels outward aggression. Fretfulness,

restlessness, and insomnia are outcomes ascribed to as failure to relieve tension by

physical activity.(3) Tests have shown that a brisk walk is as effective as a tranquilizer

without the harmful side effects.

It has been said that a five mile walk wil do more good to an unhappy but healthy

adult than al the medicine and psychology in the world. Here is an interesting story

showing the health benefits of an exercise program, (though I don't approve of running). In

his book, "Aerobics", Major Kenneth H. Cooper of the

United States Air Force Medical Corps, tel s an

interesting story of an Air Force pilot, Captain Art

Yarrington. Yarrington was a pilot of a jet supersonic

F-104 Starfighter, and was flying combat missions in

Vietnam. Captain Art Yarrington was 30 years of age.

He was a dashing young fighter pilot when his annual

physical showed a serious heart condition and he was

promptly grounded for keeps - never to fly U.S. Air

Force planes again. The young flyer was crushed.

Flying to him was living, and now it had come to an end at age 30. Then he heard of Dr.



57



Cooper's reconditioning program and came to him for help. After Dr. Cooper had finished

his tests, he gave Art only a chance in a mil ion to recover his flying status. But Art

grasped at even that infinitesimal straw. So Dr. Cooper put him on a program. The first

requirement was to stop smoking. He did. Then he was started on a supervised walking

program with gradual progression to running. He was a young man of almost unbelievable

motivation.

Back at his base doing ground duty, he fol owed the program Dr. Cooper

prescribed. This was in May. By July he was running three miles a day averaging nearly a

mile in eight minutes; by August, it was four miles; by September, five miles in forty

minutes; by October, six miles in 46 minutes. About this time he came back to Dr. Cooper

for another checkup and was given the severest kind of endurance test. He broke every

previous record on the treadmil . Dr. Cooper says he was in the best physical condition of

any man he had ever examined. He kept running until he could do 25 miles in just short of

2 hours. Two years after his dismissal from the Air Force, his adamantly final

disqualification was reversed; and he returned to flying status for combat duty in Vietnam.

Exercise wil improve the overal condition of your body; it wil slow down the aging

process and give you new zest for living.



WHAT TYPE OF EXERCISE IS BEST?





Walking outdoors in the fresh air and sunshine is the simplest and best exercise

one can do. One should avoid jumping and pounding activities. Low impact exercise such

as walking, cycling or hiking is more beneficial than are the high

impact exercises such as jogging, basketbal , weight lifting, etc.

A study published in the Spring of 1986 in the "New England

Journal of Medicine", described an analysis of nearly 17,000 Harvard

Alumni. It was found that those who engaged in such moderate

exercise as walking and climbing stairs lived up to two years longer

than their sedentary peers. Most significant of al was the fact that

those who engaged in the "high impact" vigorous exercises, such as

jogging, did not gain any significant health advantage or longevity over those whose

exercise program was also consistent each day, although less strenuous and exhausting.

Mounting scientific data suggests that jogging and other strenuous exercise might

not be worth the effort if the only reason people are doing it is to prolong their lives. The

consistent finding from several recent major studies involving thousands of people and

lasting many years - is that regular brisk walks or other moderate exercise is enough to

achieve significant health benefits. Kenneth E. Powel of the Federal Centers for Disease

Control said that experts used to think that intense physical activity was necessary to

achieve health benefits, but now it is clear that substantial gains can come from moderate

exercise. Those who can benefit the most are sedentary men.

Three years ago, Ralph Paffenbarger Jr. of Stanford University presented the

results of his now famous Harvard University alumni study, which tracked the longevity

and lifestyle of almost 17,000 graduates who entered Harvard between 1916 and 1950.

The conclusion was that inactive alumni were much more likely to die prematurely than

their more active classmates. Even mild exercise, such as walking a total of 9 miles a

week, offered substantial protection.

EXERCISE PROGRAM - KEEP IT SIMPLE





Try to find an exercise that is rewarding and fun for you. Exercising with

family members or friends makes it more enjoyable Your exercising program should not

become highly competitive. There are many types of exercise that exist, but not al bring

health for the mind as wel as the body. There are many amusements that over-stimulate

the nerves of the brain, and actual y cause a fol owing depression. True re-creation is to

restore any imbalance of our physical, mental and spiritual powers. Do not exercise when

you're not feeling up to par. It is better to do vigorous exercise before a meal than right

after a meal; although a leisurely walk is excel ent after eating.

Light exercise cal s for a four-fold increase of blood to the working muscles; and

strenuous exercise may require a ten fold increase. But exercise produces heat and so

considerable blood is shunted to the skin for cooling. As the surface vessels dilate and fil

with blood the face gets flushed and hot. The heart itself also requires more blood. This

increased demand is met by a reduction of blood flow to the kidneys, the abdominal and

miscel aneous organs. Thus it is not wise to do vigorous exercise right after eating.

Most of the indoor occupations exercise only certain muscles of the body. But for

the best health, we need al around exercise, to keep al the muscles strengthened.

Ideal y, exercise should be done in the temperature range of 40 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

The preferable type of clothing would be loose fitting cotton clothes, not polyesters

or synthetic as this would be synonymous to wearing a plastic bag and not letting your

skin breathe. Clothing should be of proper weight. A good pair of walking shoes is also

important, preferably leather or cloth rather than plastic. There are more sweat glands on

the foot than anywhere else on the body and our feet need to breathe. Our feet contain 26

bones, and we wil walk an average of 65,000 miles in a lifetime. Forty percent of al

American children have flat feet. Women have four times as much trouble as men with

their feet - could it be because of high heels? Buy shoes in late afternoon when your foot

is largest. If shoes are too tight, don't wear them.

Exercise in the best gym or health spa, however, just can't take the place of

exercise in the fresh air. Outside exercise, such as walking, gardening, or washing the car

etc. are the best. Most gyms are so il -ventilated that it would be like exercising in a dirty

tennis shoe! One authority on natural health stated that exercise outside in the fresh air

and sunshine is ten times more beneficial than exercise indoors. I strongly agree with this

statement. Choose a regular time of day to exercise. Most people prefer the early morning

hours. Start slowly and progress gradual y; don't try to overdo it at first.

You wil find that fitness improves as you exercise regularly. It would be best to

exercise a minimum of 1/2 hour per day 4 days a week; although 45 minutes per day 5 or

6 days a week would be best. Exercise improves the quality of life at every age. If you

have succumbed to sedentary habits and would like to upgrade your physical fitness, you

can do it if you wil adopt a program suited to your individual need and ability. The type of

exercise you engage in is less important than that you exercise.



HOE HANDLE MEDICINE



It was a bright, pleasant summer morning and the young man, silk scarf around his

neck and a woebegone look on his face, had ventured to ring the bel at the doctor's

house. The lady answering the door directed him to the garden behind the house where

he found the doctor hoeing sweet corn.

"Wel , sir, what's the matter?" the doctor asked after the young man stated that he

needed medical advice and assistance.
