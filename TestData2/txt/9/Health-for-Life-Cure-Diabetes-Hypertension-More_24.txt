the brain, lungs, liver, lymph nodes, bones, and parathyroid glands. Over the years

aluminum wil accumulate in the body, with older people having the largest accumulations,

resulting in major health problems.

Accumulation of aluminum in the brain has now been linked to three different kinds

of deterioration -senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, Parkinsonian dementia, and the

dialysis dementia found in patients with severe kidney failure who require blood dialysis.

The first report of aluminum poisoning came out in 1921. It cal ed attention to

tremors, memory loss, jerky movements, and uncoordination associated with aluminum;

but at that time very little was said or done about it. Several years ago aluminum once

again came into the lime light with dialysis centers treating patients with kidney failure.

Several times a week, patients would be connected to substitute kidney machines that

filtered body wastes from their bloodstreams. But some of the patients started going mad.

At first, the symptoms appeared only during dialysis - trouble with talking, confusion, and

muscle spasms. The symptoms would go away only to return with the next treatment.

Sliding swiftly downhil , patients became helpless, demented, bedridden, and final y they



77

died. Doctors cal ed the new disease dialysis dementia. They didn't know what caused it

or why some dialysis units had many patients with the mysterious il ness while others had

none.



The irregular but widespread distribution of cases suggested an environmental

poison or a trace element, says the man who final y found the answer, Dr. Alien C. Alfrey,

a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado. Autopsies of dialysis dementia

victims furnished a strategic clue: high concentrations of aluminum in the brain cel s.



It didn't take long to discover the source of the aluminum contamination. Large

amounts of tap water go into the dialysis solution used to flush wastes out of a patient's

bloodstream. (Many municipalities use aluminum to remove impurities from their water

supplies.) Although the dialysis treatment removed body wastes, aluminum eluded the

filtering system by attaching itself to blood proteins. As soon as it was recognized that

aluminum was the culprit, dialysis centers started using aluminum-free water for their

patients and there have been no new victims of dialysis dementia.



SOURCES OF ALUMINUM THAT WE INGEST



Aluminum salts are widely used as food additives, in non-prescription drugs, and as a

clarifying agent in the treatment of community water supplies.

Aluminum phosphates are the most commonly used aluminum-containing food

additives in the U.S., being frequently added to cake mixes, frozen doughs, self-rising

flours, processed cheeses, and cheese foods. They act as emulsifying agents, giving a

soft textured cheese which easily melts. Current U.S. regulations al ow 3% aluminum

phosphates in processed cheese products, which means that one slice of processed

cheese could supply up to 50 mg of aluminum.

Aluminum sulfates (alums) are common ingredients in household baking powders.

A teaspoonful of aluminum-containing baking powder may contain about 70 mg of

aluminum, so that a cake prepared with 2 tsp. of this powder would contain 10 mg of

aluminum per smal serving of cake. Aluminum sulfate is also being used as a food starch

modifier. Some companies use aluminum sulfate as firming agents in pickled vegetables

and fruits. A medium-sized pickled cucumber soaked in Dil alum solution may contain 5 to

10 mg aluminum.

Aluminum silicates are ordinarily used as anti-caking agents in dry, powdered

products. Some chewing gums contain aluminum at a level of 3-4 mg per stick.

Soft drinks have aluminum. Doctors at John Hunter Hospital analysed 106

aluminum cans and bottles representing 52 different beverages. Overal they found that

the most acidic beverages packaged in aluminum cans had the highest aluminum content.

Researchers found that non-cola soft drinks in aluminum cans contained the highest

levels of aluminum at an average of 33.4 me M/L. Cola drinks contained 24.4 me M/L in

cans and 8.9 me M/L in bottles. To put the fol owing figures in perspective, you should

know that the World Health Organization and the European Economic Community

recommend that drinking water not contain over 7.4 me M/L of aluminum.(Medical

Journal, August 92:156 (9): 604-5

Many non-prescription drugs also contain substantial levels of aluminum, including

antacids (for peptic ulcer, etc.), internal anti-pain medications (buffered aspirin for arthritic

pain and swel ing), diarrhea medicines (like Kaopectate) and hemorrhoidal medications.

Lipsticks and antiperspirants also contain high levels of aluminum. An antacid containing

aluminum hydroxide gel may provide up to 200 mg of aluminum per dose. Six grams of

buffered aspirin may provide over 400 mg of aluminum.



78



As one can readily see, aluminum is found in many items people use daily. It is

even in common table salt; however, sea salt, pickling salt, and rock salt contain no

aluminum.

Aluminum interferes with handling of iron by the body as wel as the formation of

heme (the pigment part of hemoglobin in red blood cel s). Thus, an excess of aluminum

can cause anemia.

Several reports suggest that a high aluminum intake may interfere with handling of

calcium, fluoride, and phosphorus by the body.

As mentioned earlier, accumulation of aluminum in the brain has now been linked

to Alzheimer's disease. Patients with Alzheimer's have brain aluminum concentrations that

are about four times higher than normal. In the U.S. almost 3 mil ion people have

Alzheimer's, and it kil s over 100,000 people a year. European studies have recently found

that communities with higher concentrations of aluminum in their drinking water had

substantial y more victims of Alzheimer's disease.



FACTS ON ALUMINUM COOKWARE



You buy a nice set of shiny aluminum cookware at the store, and six months later

the cookware is dul and pitted - what happened to it? The aluminum has left the cookware

and gone into the food that was cooked in it.

Boil some water in an aluminum kettle, pour it in a glass, and by holding it up to the

light you wil see aluminum particles floating in the water.

Peeled potatoes, if al owed to stand in an aluminum dish overnight, wil become

yel ow, and when cooked wil look shriveled and have dark streaks through the inner part.

Why? The potatoes absorbed some of the aluminum.

An acidic food heated and stored in aluminum cookware can add up to 4 mg of

aluminum to a serving of the food. One of the strongest indictments against aluminum

pots and pans was the testimony of Dr. H. A. McGuigan before the Federal Trade

Commission in docket Case No. 540.

A summary of Dr. McGuigan's findings, circulated by the National Committee

Against Fluoridation, charges that:

1. Boiling water in aluminum produces hydroxide poison.

2. Boiling an egg in aluminum cookware produces phosphate.

3. Boiling meat in aluminum cookware produces chloride.

4. Frying bacon in aluminum cookware produces a powerful narcotic acid, which in

large doses may cause coma.

5. Al vegetables cooked in aluminum produce hydroxide poison, which neutralizes

the digestive juices, robbing them of their value to digest food, and producing stomach

and gastro-intestinal troubles.

6. Aluminum poison wil produce acidosis which destroys the red blood cel s

producing a condition similar to anemia.



The wise thing to do is to throw away al your aluminum cookware and replace it

with stainless steel, glass, teflon, etc. cookware.

Aluminum is a poison to the human body; and the higher the concentration of

aluminum in the body, the more health problems one wil have. For optimum health one

must stop eating or drinking anything that contains aluminum, and begin drinking 8 or

more glasses of distil ed water or reverse osmosis water daily. Both distil ed and reverse

osmosis water is so pure and free of al minerals, chemicals, etc., that it wil start carrying

the aluminum deposits out of the body and you can once again begin to experience better

health.

AMALGAM FILLINGS

ARE HARMFUL



From the London Mal , November 13, 1983:

"Wife Gets Her Sight Back at Dentist's: Sweden....â€

Blind housewife Gun Thoresson regained her vision

at 43 after being blind since the age of 20. She had

her dentist remove three heavily fil ed teeth.

When a pre-dental student at the age of 21 in

1981, David Harden developed rheumatoid arthritis.

The prescribed drug therapy gradual y became

Ineffective. His father and dentist, too, removed two

amalgam fil ings from one tooth and that was the

end of David's rheumatoid arthritis.

Roy Kupslnel, MD, suffered from severe headaches since the placing of his first

fil ings of mercury amalgam when he was about five years old. At age 55 he is now

headache-free for one year. He had 29 fil ings removed and replaced with composites,

ceramic plastic resin materials.

Faye Dores had crippling arthritis, colitis, fatigue and memory loss. At age 35, she

was told that she would soon be confined to a wheelchair for life. Faye had her dentist
