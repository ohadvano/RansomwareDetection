vitamins, minerals, enzymes, etc. are removed from the corn, leaving

nothing but oil which is 100% fat. Oils of any kind, whether corn oil, olive

oil, safflower oil etc.are not natural and are harmful to the body.

Al refined fats are a burden to the body, they thicken the blood,

slowing down circulation which affects the heart and blood vessels. These oils contribute

to overweight, diabetes, and gal stone formation; and recent studies suggest they may be

involved in breast and colon cancer (14)

GROUP VII - REFINED GRAINS

Refined grains are harmful to the body. Grains are made in

such a way that the vitamins and minerals are carried almost

entirely on the outer layer. Mil ing removes this layer leaving a

white, easily ground central kernel, which is almost devoid of

vitamins and minerals. The central portion has the starch and the

protein, but both of these are more difficult to metabolize without

the accompanying minerals and vitamins.

The mil ing of wheat into refined white flour removes much of the fiber, 40% of the

chromium, 86% of the manganese, 76% of the iron, 89% of the cobalt, 68% of the copper,

78% of the zinc and 48% of the molybdenum. These are al trace elements that our body

needs. The mil ing process also destroys a large percentage of the vitamins. Bleaching is

yet another process that destroys additional vitamins and minerals in grain.

Natural grains such as whole wheat, barley, corn, mil et, oats, rice and rye are what

we need for proper nourishment. But when these are mil ed they are almost worthless.

SIMPLE RULES FOR EATING NATURAL FOODS

Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and supper like

a pauper. Eat your meals at regular times; and between meals eat

nothing. It is best that five hours elapse between meals. Two

meals a day, breakfast and the afternoon meal are better than

three for those who have a slow metabolism, who are overweight

and who have sedentary Jobs or do very little physical exercise.

Late suppers, just before bedtime, are particularly harmful, as

much of the food eaten is stored as fat instead of used. For those

who eat three meals a day, the third meal should be a light meal

and eaten several hours before going to bed.

As we learned in the chapter on water we shouldn't drink with our meals. Our water

can be taken up to 1/2 hour before our meal or else we have to wait until l hour after

eating before we drink.

The benefit derived from food depends upon the quality of food eaten. Good food

builds good blood; and poor food builds poor blood. Never eat fruit or vegetables if they

have any decay on them. Decayed fruit and vegetables ferment in the stomach and

poison the blood.

The ideal diet should have a balance of 80% of total calories as carbohydrates,

10% of total calories as fat, and 10% of total calories as protein. The ideal diet should

consist of at least 50% raw food, as raw food is live food. If one is sick, they need to eat

almost al their food raw. Take a cooked ear of corn remove a kernel and plant it and it wil

not grow, because cooked food is dead food. Whenever we cook food we destroy many of

the minerals and vitamins and al of the enzymes. For more detailed information on this

subject, see the chapter on "Fresh Food is the Best"





FOOD COMBINING

There are many food combining charts that are out on the market today, and each

one advocates different food combinations. Some of these charts are very complicated

and advocate not mixing a sweet fruit (apple) with an acid fruit (orange). I believe there is

some validity in this if you have a very weak stomach, but this doesn't apply to most

people. My chart is very simple and easy to understand. There are three different

characteristics of a true fruit and a true vegetable. A true fruit has seeds within it and a

true vegetable does not. A true fruit can only be eaten when it is ful y ripe, whereas a true

vegetable can be eaten at any stage of growth. A true fruit grows on a tree, vine, etc. A

true vegetable doesn't grow on anything, such as a carrot, onions, cabbage etc. It is best

not to eat fruits and vegetables at the same meal for the fol owing reason. Fruits digest in

from one to two hours. Whereas, vegetables take three to four hours to digest. Thus,

when eaten together, at the same meal, the fruits cannot leave the stomach until the

vegetables are digested. In most cases, Fermentation takes place in the stomach because

the fruits are held back. We also have a group of foods cal ed neutral foods, and they can

be mixed with either fruits or vegetables. These neutral foods consists of grains, nuts, and

vegetable-fruits. Foods such as the cucumbers, is a vegetable-fruit, because it has

characteristics of both the fruit, (has seeds within) and the vegetable, (it can be eaten at

any stage of growth) By fol owing this food combining chart, you wil have very few

problems with indigestion, gas, heart burn, or constipation.

"NATURAL" DEATH AND ITS CAUSES

To close this chapter out, I want to share a typical story with you that happens

many times every day here in the United States. Most American people with their poor

dietary habits, are kil ing themselves off by the thousands every day. You don't have to be

one of them.

On the morning of his 45th birthday, John Doe awoke to a peal of thunder. Glancing

out the window, he saw written fiery letters across the sky "Someone is trying to kil you,

John Doe." He didn't question the message. His only questions was "Who?"

At breakfast as he salted his fried eggs he told his wife, Mary, "Someone's trying to

kil me."

"Who?" she asked in horror.

John slowly stirred the cream and sugar into his coffee and shook his head.

"I don't know," he said.

On the way to the office John tried to think of a way to outwit his would-be

murderer. But the frustration of making time by beating traffic lights and switching lanes

occupied him whol y.

Nor, once behind his desk, could he find a moment to resolve the mystery, what

with jangling phones, urgent memos and the problems and decisions piling up as they did

every day.

It wasn't until his second martini at lunch that the ful terror of his position struck

him. It was al he could do to finish his steak. "I can't panic," he said to himself while

Lighting his cigar. "I simply must live my life as usual."

So he worked til seven as usual. Drove home as fast as usual. Ate a hearty dinner

as usual. Had his two Cocktails as usual. He took his usual two sleeping capsules in order

to get his usual six hours sleep.

As the days passed he manful y stuck to his routine. His pride grew as he managed

to go on living for years. But, as it must to al men, death came at last to John Doe. It

came at his desk on a particularly busy day. He was 54.

His grief-stricken widow demanded a ful autopsy, but it showed only emphysema,

arteriosclerosis, duodenal ulcers, cirrhosis of the liver, cardiac neurosis, a cerebrovascular

aneurysm, pulmonary edema, obesity, circulatory insufficiency and a touch of cancer.

"How glad Bil would have been," said Bil 's widow, smiling proudly through her

tears, "to know that he died of natural causes."





THE NATURAL WAY IS THE HEALTHY WAY

Natural foods encourage life, promote strength and endurance and help restore lost

health. Unnatural foods cause sickness and decay. You wil find the natural foods close to

nature, in the gardens and orchards. You wil find unnatural foods on the grocery shelf,

preserved and packaged in a bag, box or can.

It isnâ€™t any sacrifice at al to eat natural foods, It's just another step toward an

unblemished skin, a new spring in your step, a new light in the eye. It's a step toward a

strong heart and untainted breath. It's just another step toward untroubled sleep and new

vigor each morning. It's another step toward an unclouded mind and clear decisions. It's

just another step toward the abundant health you've always wanted.
