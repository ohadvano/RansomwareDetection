Kiran clutched his weapon tighter. Too many times he had been panicking when encountering these beasts. He needed to muster his resolve once and for all. He turned to Gatril and said, “Do you smell anything?”
“I smell her,” Gatril said, “and something…rotten.” Gatril crept closer to the nest when her eye caught something. She washed the light of the lantern over it, revealing gnawed bones of various animals littering the place.
Kiran studied the remains and found among remains the parts of crocodiles, deer, gazelles, hippos, lions, selkies, and humans. “…This place…it’s…” He shuddered.
A deep hiss suddenly crackled in the air. Kiran and Gatril scampered away from the nest. “She knows we’re here!” said Gatril.
“Quick!” said Kiran. “Set the nest on fire!”
Gatril tossed the lantern upon the nest with so much force the glass shattered, splashing the flammable liquid everywhere. The crackling and snapping of the oxidation of the nest and its subsequent combustion spread along with the flames.
Kiran had an idea, and said to Gatril, “Do you know how to use a gun?”
“Just point and pull the trigger, right?” she said.
He tossed the gun to her and said, “The cartridge has four shots. They’re sticky rounds, so aim at her feet.”
And just as Kiran got his staff ready, the nest burst outward. Thrashing arms flung debris from the face of the beast. It stood at eight feet tall, squat built with green-brown skin. Its large head was vaguely humanoid but the green eyes were wide-set, along with a massive mouth. It had long, wiry webbed arms and a large dorsal fin. Its hair was long and stringy, soaked in some kind of fluid. But what caught Kiran’s eyes besides the toothy maw were the smooth, dangling breasts and her scaly vagina, slick and wet.
The Riverwench opened her mouth and said, “You dare to burn down my home, insects?”
“Says the one eating people left and right!” Gatril replied.
The Riverwench snarled. “I’ll devour you and turn you into dung!”
Kiran set the orbs on his staff alight. “Gatril, shoot when you have an opening!” Kiran charged ahead. He tapped his staff and raised a column of earth. 
The Riverwench smashed it with her arm and dove after Kiran. The human leaped out of the way and rolled onto his feet, immediately unleashing consecutive concussive blasts. But they only staggered the beast and enraged her. 
Gatril fired at her feet. The sticky ball exploded around the Riverwench’s ankles and affixed it to the ground.
The beast shrieked and lifted her foot along with the dirt, freeing herself. “Wretches and your witchery!”
“The ground is too loose!” said Kiran. “Head further into the forest!”
But the Riverwench was too fast, rushing towards Gatril now that she realized their plan. The bosdrake barely leapt out of the way of the beast’s arm. The Riverwench swung her claws, but Gatril was able evade all of them, then spat a stream of acid in retaliation. The Riverwench lifted her arm, screaming when the liquid sizzled her flesh. She struck with her foot and sent Gatril flying across the ground.
“Gatril!” Kiran ran towards the monstrous fish, tapping the ground and raising a set of mounds before him. He leaped onto them and launched himself at the Riverwench. But he was wide open, and the Riverwench swung her arm back for a deathly. 
Just as Kiran had predicted.
Kiran shot out a blast that propelled him higher and over the creature’s head as she swung at nothing. He landed and twisted his ankle, letting out a loud yelp. The pain was intense but he blocked it from his mind and continued with his plan. Kiran tapped the ground and raise it beneath the creature’s feet. He fired another concussive blast that toppled the Riverwench.
Kiran suddenly felt a grip around his waist. It was Gatril, on her feet. She ran with Kiran into the woods. And the Riverwench got up and went after them.
“Can you walk?” Gatril said.
“Not fast enough!” said Kiran. 
Gatril put the gun into her mouth and quickly climbed a tree. She laid Kiran near a large enough limb and gave the gun to him. “Now you stay here! I’ll get her attention!” and Gatril looked down at the Riverwench.
She spotted the two up in the tree and said, “Do you think I cannot climb a tree, fools?”
Gatril grinned at her, and said, “Don’t worry! I’m coming for you!” 
Gatril leapt out of the tree and the Riverwench opened her mouth. But Gatril spat acid in it. The Riverwench choked and coughed out the fluid before it could do any damage. Gatril ran around and threw her feet, cutting away at the Riverwench’s flesh to reach the tendons, using the trees as leverage and shield as her taller adversary tried to grab her.
Fortunately for the Riverwench, her stamina outlasted Gatril’s, allowing her to finally catch the bosdrake with a big swing of her arm, launching Gatril into a tree.
Gatril’s whole body succumbed to the blow and she fell. She saw the Riverwench coming in for the finishing blow, but couldn’t find the strength to move, crippled by the searing pain from a broken rib. Gatril prepared her last line of defense and brought up acid in her throat, but she hesitated when there was a muffled explosion and the other female suddenly found herself stuck.
Alarmed, the Riverwench looked down and saw black, rubbery matter around her foot. Kiran fired a second shot that glued her other foot to the ground. The human carefully climbed down the tree as the Riverwench tried to twist her feet free, but the wounds dealt by Gatril stole the strength from her muscles.
Seizing the chance, Gatril spat acid on the Riverwench’s right shoulder. She screamed and leered at the bosdrake. “I’ll kill you!”
Kiran went over to Gatril and shouldered some of her weight on him, gently lifting her. “Are you alright?” he said.
“I’ll be fine once we get to screw her,” said Gatril. Then she turned to the giant. “Hey, you!”
