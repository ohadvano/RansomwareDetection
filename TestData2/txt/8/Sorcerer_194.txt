The guard frowned. “Very well then mam. Thank you for your time.” The guard walked away, but as he did, Kiran, who had been standing close by and pretending to read a map, took a few glances at the woman and found another peculiarity. 
She just so happened to have a huge bulge in her belly. Was she pregnant?
Kiran knew human females couldn’t breed beyond the age of fifty, and she also happened to have a wider variety of fish, and bigger ones at that.
Suspicions tickled Kiran’s nose, and he decided he would do some investigation of his own. 
Kiran waited until evening came, when everyone was starting to pack up after a good day’s sale. Kiran returned to the market and found the woman packing up her things on a cart and pedaled it out of the market. “Okay,” he whispered, hiding in a dark alley as the woman rode by, “time to go.”
Kiran moved by foot, opting for stealth rather than speed and ease of transportation. Not to mention he was quick on his feet too. As the sun set, and the gaslight lamps came on, Kiran skulked from alley to alley behind his target. 
He followed her to a secluded part of the city through a path of fern bushes and noisy crickets. Kiran took out his staff, now cautious of what was lurking around these parts. The woman led him to a cottage built atop a concrete base. It was situated in a damp area with large, smooth stones placed around the house with a walkway leading onto the path. Further from the house was a small stream, further fueling Kiran’s assumptions.
“Now let’s see what happens,” Kiran said, and crouched behind a tree.
The woman parked the cart inside a small shed and proceeded inside the house. Lights came on through the windows, and a lamp outside illuminated the yard. The woman came back out, dressed in a light blue skirt and her hair tied into a bun. She sat on the front porch in a rocking chair, drinking something while she caressed her stomach.
Kiran picked up a fishy smell in the air he hadn’t a few moments ago, but casted it off as just the leftovers coming from the woman’s house. She hummed to herself, adding to the noisy insects, frogs and gurgling stream.
Then Kiran heard splashes.
They came from out of view, east of the river were the growth concealed the rest of its body. The splashes got louder, and the silhouette of the form that made them appeared, thick-bodied with humanoid proportions.
Kiran tightened his grip on his staff. 
He saw the woman stop the rocking chair and stand up. More of the shadowy figures appeared, varying in height with a few short ones. He heard the woman say, “Good evening everyone. How are you?”
The visitors lumbered out of the water and towards the house, into the light that revealed them. They had slick, shiny skin a shade between blue and grey. Their hands and feet were webbed, with a dorsal fin that stemmed from the back of their heads and down their spines. They had large pale eyes and a green neck and belly. Their mouths were wide, their lips thick, and their muscular nostrils large and contracting. The sides of their jaws were lined with gills, and Kiran knew exactly what they were.
“Selkies,” he whispered. 
Kiran contain his excitement, accessing the situation. He glanced at their crotch, but saw only pink, fleshy stubs atop their testicles. There was no female in sight much to Kiran’s dismay. 
The woman approached them eagerly. Three of the selkies the size of children ran towards the woman and hugged her, while the three larger males watched in silence. 
I knew it, Kiran thought. She must’ve been with the selkies. And those ones, they must be her children.
Kiran had heard stories about humans and monsters mating to reproduce under certain circumstances, particular the beasts who possessed human intelligence. Here was something along those lines. But his mission came first, he needed selkie queex for his spell. He didn’t dare face them on his own, and decided he would go back for Gatril.
But as the boy turned around, he was met with two of the selkies staring him down. Kiran froze. “Yikes!”
“Trespasser…” growled one of them. 
Kiran tried to run but a selkie held onto him. Kiran spun around with his staff and activated his force-counter spell. The concussive blast knocked the selkie away, but the other one managed to deliver a backhand to Kiran that immediately stunned him and dropped him on the ground. 
The selkie dove after Kiran. Kiran lifted his staff one more, but the selkie slapped it away. Kiran shrieked and leapt towards it. The selkie grabbed him and threw him into a tree. The burst of pain cause Kiran’s muscles to seize up, and the selkie lifted him by his neck and carried him towards the house.
Kiran struggled, but his strength couldn’t match that of the fishman. This made him realize just how helpless humans were without their magic or weapons.
“What’s this?” the woman said as the selkie dragged the human to the front of the house, tossing him on his hand and knees. 
“A spy, madam…” the selkie said.
Kiran looked up and saw that he was surrounded by the selkies. The smaller ones came curiously close to the human, then retreated when Kiran gave them terrified stares. The other selkie Kiran had knocked down eventually recovered and joined them, holding Kiran’s staff.
Kiran saw the many faces of all shapes, differentiating each selkie, but the commanding stare of the woman was what caught his attention. “Who are you, boy?” she said.
“M-Me?” said Kiran.
“Yes, you!” the woman said. “What are you doing on my property?”
Kiran decided honesty was the best way to get on their soft side, and said, “My name is Kiran Kehomba. I’m a sorcerer in training. I came here searching for the queex of a selkie.”
“Queeeeeex?” a selkie said.
“What is queex?” said one of the children.
“A woman’s crotch juice, son,” said another. He glared at Kiran. “You want to find a selkie woman to rape, human?”
