Kiran nodded. “Yeah. Sure.” He looked around at the floor. “Well, I better start working on my spell now.”
While Gatril wiped herself, Kiran took the bowl and poured its contents into a clear jar. He took up two other jars and fetched the spell book. Along with the vaginal fluids of a bosdrake, he needed a little sulphur and powdered mango seed. Once he got the substances together, Kiran mixed them around in the jar.
Gatril sat and watched Kiran at work, wondering who his grandfather was, and also about Kiran’s profession and future. Not many beasts had the opportunity to see the intricacies of how humans developed their society.
When the queex began to take on a gelatinous form, Kiran took it out of the jar and placed it in his hands. He rolled it together until it hardened into a white, discolored orb.
“Got it!” Kiran said.
“What will you do with that?” said Gatril.
“Just watch…” Kiran’s movements were bouncy. He took up his staff and quickly carved a space at the top that he filled with glue. He placed the orb into it and waited for it to dry.
Kiran sprung to his feet, his pants still stained with semen and vaginal fluids. “It’s ready!”
Gatril got up. “Good. Now we can see what all that sex was for.”
Gatril followed him outside, squinting a little from the sunlight. Kiran looked around and found a large stone. He summoned forth his spirit energy and channeled it into the staff. “Okay Gatril, watch closely.”
“I am you little rascal,” she said.
Kiran tossed the rock. As the object fell, he channeled his energy into the orb in the staff. A shockwave snapped from it and hit the rock, sending it flying into the bushes like a missile. Kiran leaped and punched the air. “Yes! It worked!”
Smiling, Gatril said, “Congratulations.” She scratched her cheek. “What the hell was that anyway?”
Kiran said, “It was a basic force-counter spell. It produces a blast of kinetic energy that can repel objects of a certain size. Anything the size of a man will be sent flying.”
“Neat trick,” she said. Gatril swayed her tail as she assessed the situation. “So this competition that you’re going to enter, what else does it have?”
Kiran proudly stood with the staff before him like a cane. “We’re supposed to complete three trials, then face off against each other in the finals. The successful ten contestants will be chosen to serve on the Grand Magic Council, or as aids to nobles and the king. I need to create five spells, so I need the queex of five beasts.”
Gatril frowned. “Five beasts? Their queex? Really? Are you sure it’s not just an excuse for you to have sex with beasts?
Kiran dropped his staff and franticly waved his hands. “No! No! I swear!” He pointed back into the hut. “The spells I want require those specific parts! Honest!”
Gatril narrowed her emerald eyes at the human. “Hmmm. And you say I was the first?”
Kiran nodded. “Yeah! I-I was going about it by order. First there’s you; a bosdrake, then a lamia, a selkie, popobawa and a j’bafofi.”
Gatril became visibly shaken. “A j’bafofi? That monster feeds on humans and other beasts alike. They aren’t as negotiable as I am.”
Kiran gave her a firm nod. “Indeed. And I need one for a strong spell. A wizard must be willing to go to the furthest lengths both physically and mentally, to achieve their desired magic. That’s what my grandfather taught me.”
“Your grandfather is a madman,” said Gatril. “You’ll die if you go there all on your own.”
“Well…” Kiran hugged Gatril around her waist. “I won’t be all by myself, now that I have a friend.”
Gatril gave Kiran and incredulous look. “What makes you think I’ll help you, human? I’m quite fine here in this forest. I can eat sleep, and have sex with the occasional beast, or batoiko that wanders off from his tribe…”
Gatril trailed off when Kiran smiled even harder at her. “Aww,” he said. “I see, so you’re a bit of a sexplorer yourself. Must’ve picked up a thing or two from the that human you were talking about.”
Her cover blown, Gatril said, “Yeah whatever. And your point is?”
“Then come with me,” Kiran said. “You and I can have lots of sex, now that my virginity isn’t weighing me down.”
Indeed, the prospect was tantalizing to the bosdrake, but her instincts had to consider the possible dangers that would be out there along their possible journey. “This continent has five kingdoms,” she said. “Between them are scattered clans and villages that war and trade with each other at times. If it were not for some villages pledging allegiance to these kingdoms with taxes in order for protection, these places would be in chaos. Not only will you have to worry about monsters, but humans are notorious for being capable of horrible things.”
“My parents already understand,” said Kiran. “My father already has two other sons besides me to carry on his name, and help in the carpentry business. He doesn’t hate me, but he doesn’t like that I took on his father’s profession. He says those are for the old days of witch doctors—that medicine has come far along with the sciences. But this world—it still has magic. I want to be a part of those old days of legends.”
Gatril heard the resolve in the young man’s voice and began to reconstruct her previous assumption. Perhaps he was more than just a stiff cock for her to sit on when she was in heat. “Fine, Kiran the sorcerer. I accept your request. However, I have a few conditions.”
“Sure,” Kiran said, “what did you have in mind?”
“First, I like my crotch licked,” Gatril said, “so you’ll have to be willing to give more than I will for you.”
Kiran nodded. “Okay.”
“Second,” Gatril continued, “assuming you’ll be fighting monsters, you’ll need my assistance. Henceforth, I’ll need to eat the best food money can buy, or we can hunt.”
