sdhash
======
sdhash is tool that allows two arbitrary blobs of data to be compared for 
similarity based on common strings of binary data. It is designed to provide 
quick results during triage and initial investigation phases. It has been in 
active development since 2010 with the explicit goal of becoming fast, scalable, 
and reliable.

There two general classes of problems where sdhash can provide significant 
benefits–fragment identification and version correlation.

In fragment identification, we search for a smaller piece of data inside a 
bigger piece of data (“needle-in-a-haystack”). For example:

Block vs. file correlation: given a chunk of data (disk block/network packet
/RAM page/etc), we can search a reference collection of files to identify 
whether the chunk came from any of them.

File vs. RAM/disk image: given a file and a target image, we can efficiently 
determine if any pieces of the file can be found on the image (that includes 
deallocated storage).

In version correlation, we are interested in correlating data objects (files) 
that are comparable in size and, thus, similar ones can be viewed as versions. 
These are two basic scenarios in which this is useful–identifying related 
documents and identifying code versions.

In all cases, the use of the tool is the same, however the interpretation may 
differ based on the circumstances.
