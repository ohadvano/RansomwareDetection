I take a deep breath. “Terry, I'm sorry you had to witness that the other night.” I wince just remembering about it.
“I won't have some little shit shout at you like that, Alice.” Terry slams the pan back on the stove a little too hard. “You gotta stick up for yourself.”
“What do you suggest I do?” I cross my arms over my chest and smile warmly.
“Kick'em where it hurts the most.” He whistles. “Right in the fucking balls.”
I chuckle. “Noted.”
I'm smiling by the time I walk out the kitchen but it vanishes when I see who's occupying the bar stools. Ryder's already sneering at me while Kellan pretends to read the menu.
“Don't even pretend that you're reading that.” I take the menu from him.
Kellan frowns at me. “Everything okay?”
“What do you think? I'm being followed around and it's driving me insane! If you think I'm going to tell Max about you, then you don't know me at all. I won't tell him anything.”
