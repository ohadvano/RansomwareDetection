I'm standing underneath a spray of hot water in the wolves' bathroom, feeling like a knife's been shoved into my chest.
The second we saw Terry's body, we all shifted back and changed into our clothes and took in the mess in front of us.
There were no words to express how I felt in that moment when I looked at Terry's dead body. His throat slashed, body mutilated with blood spattered everywhere on the ground. Numb would be a reasonable answer, but the realization that I knew this man who's been somewhat of a father figure to me for all these years, makes the pain inside my chest a lot worse.
The question I keep asking myself is why target someone like Terry? He was a man who kept to himself and worked extremely hard at the diner to earn his way in life. There were days where he'd shout at the customers who would insult his cooking, but nothing to result in him getting killed.
Another dead body found yet it's the same month as Mr Daniel's death - could it be a different killer or has the motive changed? But what could've changed to make the killer target two innocent men who were kind and forgiving?
It's still hard for me to process the fact that Terry is now gone and that there won't be someone there who was like a father to me.
I'm engrossed at the scene in front of me but when I realise that Kellan's moved from his position to grab something in Terry's hand, it takes my attention away from the lifeless body. Kellan picks up what appears to be a piece of crinkled paper and hands it to Ryder. He looks at the paper handed to him, takes it from Kellan and opens it in silence. I watch Ryder's face changing a split second from having no emotion at all to anger.
“Ryder, you alright?” Kellan looks worryingly at Ryder. Ryder looks away, I can see him tensing his jaw. “What's wrong?” I look at the piece of paper.
He puts the crinkled paper in the back pocket of his jeans. “Nothing's wrong. Let's just do something about the body.”
