He slowly looks back at me and nods his head leisurely. “Suspicions are that whoever killed these victims were likely caused by an animal, but there's not enough evidence to show what truly killed them.”
I pick up the glass and take a sip of the water. “Maybe it isn't an animal attack, but I can't think of why someone would want to kill them unless they had a good reason to which I sincerely doubt it.”
Tom just shrugs. “Maybe there is a motive, but we somehow haven't found it yet.”
I slam down the glass on the table. “Well, then you need to find it before somebody else dies.”
His eyes widen at my response.
I take a deep breath. “The next victim could be anyone or do you not realize that officer? Why haven't you gone to the press and why keep the murders a secret from the town?” I'm bombarded with questions that I want to be answered, but something tells me that I won't get anything out of Kellan's father.
He looks down at the floor. “Myself and the officers are doing everything we can, and the reason behind why the police haven't gone to the reporters is because we want to make sure that we know exactly who's responsible, whether it be an animal or a human being. We don't want to scare the town.”
For some reason, I can understand why the police haven't gone to the reporters. Who knows what could happen when the whole town finds out that there's a murderer out there?
I stand from the chair preparing to leave when Tom suddenly stands too. “Before you leave, I'd like to ask you something.”' He looks perplexed at me. “Did you and Mr. Daniels get along at all?”
