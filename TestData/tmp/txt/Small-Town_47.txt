I'm starting to get very impatient with him, “Ryder!”
Ryder's head swivels back to look at me. “The colour of your eyes was unexpected.”
“Why? What colour were they?” He pauses for a long time. “Red.”
A pause.
“What?” I whisper.
“Red, your eyes were red.”
What? Surely he's lying...
Ryder clears his throat and frowns. “You're an Alpha.”
Chapter 11

“What!?” I spluttered. “That's impossible!”
I can't believe what I'm hearing, it just doesn't make sense at all. Me? An Alpha? That doesn't seem right.
“I know, but it's what you are.”
“Yeah, but how? You should know about this stuff!”
For someone who's been a wolf all his life, he should know why this has happened.
“I don't know! I'm just as confused as you are.”
None of us says anything for a while, I think we're both in shock.
“And by the way, I'm fine. Thanks for asking.” Ryder looks at me in confusion. “What?”
I place my hands on my hips. “Have you forgotten about the part of you attacking me?”
“Are you being serious? Because if I remember, you're the one who started it.”
I roll my eyes. “Very mature.”
I turn away from him and enter back into the house to see Sam cleaning up the milk and the glass off the floor.
“Sam let me do that.”
Sam puts the broken glass in the trashcan and smiles at me. “It's done. Don't worry about it.” He points outside.
“Has he left?”
“No, unfortunately.” I wrap the blanket tighter around me. Ryder walks into the kitchen. “I can hear you, you know?” He closes the door and leans against it.
Sam walks right up to him, and with her finger, she points the middle of his chest. “You can leave now.”
He ignores her and walks over to me. His eyes caress me.
Men...
“Are you alright at least?” “Like you care?”
I turn away and walk up the stairs, I hear him following me.
“Believe it or not, I actually do care about you. I wouldn't be here if I didn't.”
When I reach Sam's bathroom I ignore Ryder, grab my clothes from the floor and go into Sam's bedroom to change. I see the broken shards of glass all over Sam's carpet and feel a great amount of guilt.
I'll have to buy her a new one.
“My transformation was a success, you're no longer needed.”
With my back to Ryder, I drop the blanket, I hear Ryder suck in a breath behind me.
“Alice, you don't mean that.”
“Actually, I do. And by the way, I still haven't forgotten about what you did.”
I grab the shirt from the floor and pull it over my head.
I feel Ryder's presence coming closer and closer just as he stops right behind me, I hear his breathing against my neck. “I hope you're not talking about who I think you are.”
When he places his hands on my hips, my breathing increases.
“What you did was unforgivable.”
Picturing Max's beaten face and him standing on crutches brings back the anger I had earlier today.
Ryder leans in close to my ear, his mouth slightly touching the top of my ear. “And I told you that I didn't do it.”
His whole body frames mine so perfectly that I lean slightly backwards into his tall frame. He leans forward, wraps his arm around my waist and pulls me tighter to him. I feel his warm, solid chest against my back.
“How do I know if you're telling the truth?” “Then, you'll just have to trust me.”
He rubs his nose behind my ear causing a shiver to run down my back.
I escape his hold. “Enough.”
I turn to face him to see him biting his lip with his eyes fixed on me, I pull my shirt down to cover myself. “What's the matter?” He strides over to me.
There's no way I'm getting close to him like that again. “You don't want me?”
I'm walking backwards having no idea what's behind me. “Don't ever touch me like that again.”
When my back meets Sam's dresser, I quickly place my arm in front of me to stop Ryder from coming any closer.
He grabs my wrist and pulls it towards his chest.
As he walks towards me with my hand still on his chest, I feel my hand descending downwards and before I know it, Ryder's right in front of me.
“What do you think you're doing?” I look down at the floor.
He places a fingertip under my chin and lifts it up. “Doing what I should have done a long time ago”
Ryder reaches down and places his hands behind my legs. “What's that supposed to mean?”
Ryder leans in closer. “You know exactly what it means.”
He lifts me up by my legs and sits me on top of the dresser with my legs wrapped around his waist. My hands stay rooted to the dresser's edge.
“Are you gonna stop me?”
Ryder strokes my thighs while staring into my eyes. I find myself shaking my head.
The moment I shake my head, Ryder's mouth slams onto mine; his lips soft and smooth. His tongue invades my mouth and starts aggressively fighting with mine. One of Ryder's hand holds the back of my neck tightly as he controls the kiss, while his other hand's under my thigh. Sam's makeup and perfume fall off the dresser in our haste to get closer to each other. He pulls my hair and goes down my neck; kissing every part of me he touches. I can only close my eyes and enjoy the moment.
I run my hands through his hair when he suddenly kisses down the valley between my breasts, and I can't help but shiver from the contact. No man has ever kissed that part of me.
Just when I feel his hands on my breasts, I feel another presence coming into the room.
“You have got to be kidding me!?”
Both of our heads swing to the doorway, but neither of us move from the position we are in.
“Do you mind?” Ryder growls at Sam which wakes me out of my trance. What the hell am I doing?
Kissing Ryder was not supposed to happen.
“In fact, I do mind. That's my best friend you were mauling just now.” Sam stands with her hands on her hips.
Ryder strides over to Sam with his fists clenched. “I was not mauling her. Did she look distressed or uncomfortable to you?”
“Ryder, were you not here tonight? She's in a state that makes her vulnerable to doing anything.”
I get off from the dresser and continue getting dressed. “You don't know what the hell you're talking about, Sam.”
Sam scoffs. “Just leave okay? She's had a tough night and she needs a rest.”
My eyes are cast downwards when I hear Ryder approaching me. “Alice?”
He cups my cheeks gently. “Do you want me to leave?” I move out of his hold and look away. “Yes.”
I walk over to the window, giving Ryder my back.
He doesn't move straight away like I thought he would.
A few seconds go by when he walks out the room and down the stairs, I hear the front door slam shut.
“If he's broken the fucking door there's no explaining that to my parents.”
From my position in the window, I see Ryder only in his trousers running down the middle of the road.
One second he's human, the next he's transformed. “Alice?”
My eyes are still glued to where Ryder ran off, “Yeah?”
“You okay? You haven't really spoken since you've changed back.”
Sam comes to a stop behind me.
I turn around and smile at my best friend. “I'm fine.
Thanks to you.”
“If something would have happened to you.” Tears start to well in her eyes.
“Sam, don't be like that.” I place my hands on her shoulders. “Tonight, anything could've happened, but I'm still standing and I'm fine.”
Sam rubs her eyes and smiles. “Do you feel any different?”
I drop my hands and shrug. “I feel no different than before, but I think some parts of me will change eventually. Like my hearing and my ability to smell things more clearly.”
Sam walks to her dresser and sneers, “And your libido.”
My what?
“Excuse me?”
Sam looks surprised at me. “You didn't know that?”
Sam giggles to herself. “If you watched Vampire Diaries, then you'd know that your sexual desire becomes more frequent.”
“Meaning?”
Sam snorts. “Meaning you'll want sex all the time.”
“There's no way that's true Sam and besides it's a TV show, doesn't mean that it's true.”
Sam looks at me with a look of disgust on her face, “Oh, really? So it wasn't you just now trying to eat Ryder's face off?” Sam arches her brow.
Kissing Ryder was a huge mistake and I'm standing in Sam's room trying to come up with a reasonable explanation for why I did what I did, but I come up with nothing other than it was a mistake.
“And don't try to tell me that it meant nothing because trust me, it didn't look like nothing.”
“It just happened and I can't believe I let it happen.”
Sam looks at me with a huge grin. “See? It's your libido.”
I pinch the bridge of my nose and close my eyes, “Okay, that's enough sex talk.”
“I'm just saying that your whole life is about to change, little virgin.” Sam smirks at me.
Being a virgin is really not that big of a deal. I've had boyfriends before but I'd rather give it to someone that I really care about and besides, there's no rush to losing it. I'm only eighteen and in no hurry; unlike Sam who lost her virginity at sixteen.
“I'm sure I'll be fine, Sam.”
Sam picks up her makeup and perfume and places them back on the dresser. “If you say so but believe me, you and Ryder were pretty hot together.”
“Sam!”
“Imagine doing it with a wolf though? With Bane. Do you think with him it would be rough sex with lots of sweat involved or slow passionate lovemaking?” Sam arches her brow at me.
I find myself walking out of her bedroom to somehow escape. “I'm not talking about this with you.”
Sam follows. “Yeah, but aren't you a little curious about what sex is like?” I turn to look at Sam.
“Honestly Sam, I haven't thought about it and it didn't even cross my mind.”
Sam sticks her tongue out playfully. “Until now.” “Look, we just kissed, that's all. No big deal.” End of discussion.
I turn back around and walk into the kitchen to put the kettle on. “Tea?”
“Please.”
Sam sits at the table and takes her phone out of her pocket. “Can I ask you a question?”
Sam puts her phone down on the table and frowns. “Sure.” “How did you have Ryder's number?”
Sam shifts her weight on the seat and plays with her phone. “I got it the other day at school when you and Max were getting food together. Ryder sat at the next table and he wanted to exchange numbers in case anything happened to you, so I gave it to him.”
“Oh. Then it's a good thing you had it.”
I place two teaspoons of sugar in each mug, grab two tea- bags, pour the hot water and milk into the mugs, throw away the tea-bag and stir the tea. I grab the two mugs and bring them over to the table.
“Look, he came here tonight to save you which obviously means he cares. The first thing he asked when he picked up the phone was if you were okay, and he didn't have to bother coming here tonight but he did. For you.”
Sam takes a sip of her tea.
I find myself not having anything to say to that, I just grab my mug of tea and take a sip.
“You can stay here tonight if you want.”
I place my mug back on the table and sigh. “You won't mind? I haven't been the best company tonight.”
Sam looks at me with shock. “Alice, you went through hell tonight and it's not your fault. Blame the wolf that bit you.”
“I don't wanna be like this forever, Sam. What if there's a cure out there somewhere?”
Sam shakes her head. “Alice, I don't think there will be. This new part of you is gonna be with you for the rest of your life, and somehow you're just gonna have to accept it, even if you don't want to.'
I stifle a yawn and nod. “Yeah, I guess you're right but I still can't believe this is happening to me. It's just not right.”
Sam smiles reassuringly at me. “There's nothing wrong with being what you are even though it's gonna change your life. You should embrace it.”
I don't say anything straight away but a part of me believes that what Sam says is right. “You're right, I can't change what's happened so I've just got to live with it.”
Sam gets out of her chair, takes her mug to the dishwasher and yawns. “You should know by now that I'm always right.”
“I can't argue with you on that.” I smile as I get up from the table.
“You can sleep in the spare bedroom if you want, for privacy.”
Sam waves as she makes her way up the stairs, “Night.” “Goodnight.” I whisper.
As I place the mug in the dishwasher and make my way to the spare bedroom, I think about the events of tonight. I managed to transform without hurting anybody other than Ryder, and besides he's not the one that got hurt.
In a way I felt glad that Ryder was there with me, but I can't help but think about the kiss we shared. Facing him tomorrow won't be something I'll be excited about, avoiding him sounds like a great idea right about now.
When I reach the spare bedroom, I see that Sam's given me something to wear for bed. I remove my clothes, put on the sweats and the vest then get into bed. The moment my head hits the pillow, I feel my eyes grow heavy, and soon find that I can't keep my eyes open.
Chapter 12

It's the last day of the week, and I couldn't be happier that it's finally Friday. This week has been beyond crazy, and I'm ready to put this week completely behind me.
When Sam comes to wake me up at 8, I get up from the bed, take a shower and wear the clothes that Sam has provided me with. I put on black skinny jeans and a band t-shirt that I'm unfamiliar with.
When I come downstairs, I see that Sam's mother has prepared us both breakfast.
“Morning Alice, did you sleep well?”
She grabs the steaming kettle and pours the hot water into three mugs.
I smile as I make my way to the table. “Morning Sally. I actually slept better than I thought I would.”
I cross my arms on the table and look out towards the window.
“Sam should be down in a minute. She's probably trying to decide what to wear to school.”
Sally brings a mug of tea over and places it in front of me.
I thank her and place my hands around the hot mug to keep my hands nice and warm.
Sally also brings over a plate with butter covered toast to the table and sits down next to me. “How's things at home? Your mom doing okay?” She grabs a little plate from the middle of the table and takes a piece of toast.
Things at home have been kinda strange since recent events. Before being bitten, I never once had a boy over at my house, let alone having four shapeshifters in my living room.
I take a sip from the mug and look at my best friend's mother. “Everything's fine and mom's always working at the hospital so I barely get to see her.”
Sally smiles warmly. “Your mother's always been a workaholic. I remember when your mother and I went to school together. She always carried a box of tissues with her at all times just in case someone got a nosebleed.”
I snicker. “Sounds like my mother.” I grab a piece of toast and take a bite.
“Everything alright at school? Sam mentioned that you've got a new English teacher?” Sally looks behind her at the clock and shakes her head.
I nod my head.
Do I mention what happened to Mr. Daniels to her or not?
“Yeah, Mr. Edmund has taken over the class.” I clear my throat. “And school? The same as always, I guess.”
Sally raises her brow. “Meaning?”
“Meaning...” Before I have a chance to answer I get interrupted.
“Meaning it's an absolutely pointless ritual that's full of hormonal teenage boys who drool at even a slight peak of cleavage.”
I'm looking at my best friend with my mouth hanging wide open; stunned into silence. When I think that her mother is going to yell at her daughter for being crude, Sally surprises me when she bursts out laughing. “The words that come out of your mouth, Sam.” She stands from the table and empties the contents into the sink. “You're definitely my daughter.”
Sam scoffs. “And here I thought I was adopted.”
Sam takes an apple from the fruit bowl that sits on the end of the table.
“Oh honey, sorry to disappoint you.”
Sally kisses the top of Sam's head and winks at me. “You girls have a good day at school.”
She waves and leaves the room.
When the house door closes I smirk towards Sam. “You wish you were adopted?”
“You would be too if you heard what goes on in this house.” Sam looks in the microwave and looks at herself through the reflection. “They're at it all the time.”
I may have thrown up a little in my mouth hearing about Sam's parents' love life. I guess with how close we are as best friends it's nice to know that she feels comfortable sharing things with me, but sharing things about her parents might just be a little bit too personal. “That's a little too much information, Sam.”
Sam turns around. “I bet sex with Ryder was on your mind last night.”
I groan. “Can you please not bring last night up again. I feel weird that you had to witness that.”
“Please.” Sam scoffs. “Last night was nothing compared to what I've done. My parents have caught me doing way worse things.”
I get up from the table, grab my shoes and bag from where I left them yesterday under the stairs.
“My dad chased a guy once right down the drive with a baseball bat in his hands. He never visited again.”
Sam grabs her keys and opens the front door.
“I don't blame the poor guy. No one would wanna mess with your dad.”
“That's what dads are for. Chasing away every guy on the planet who wants to date their daughter, I mean what would your dad.	” I turn to see her clenching her eyes
tightly. “Shit	I shouldn't have brought him up. I'm so sorry, Alice.”
In the past when people would ask a simple question like, 'what do your parents do?' I always responded with a lie. For eighteen years, I've learnt to accept the fact that he isn't coming back to me and my mother. Besides, after all these years I don't think she'd want anything to do with him. I remember the days when she'd lock herself in her room and never come out, I'd sit outside her bedroom door for hours just to make sure that she was still breathing.
Being that young and oblivious, I didn't know what was happening, there was nothing I could do to make her happy. I see it sometimes on her face when she isn't looking, the faraway look she has in her eyes, and it makes me wonder if she actually misses him. It was hard seeing my mother lost like that, I never want to see my mother in that state ever again.
I shrug. “There's nothing to be sorry for. It's not your fault my dad just up and left.”
She sighs. “I know that we don't talk about it. It's just, why?” Sam shakes her head. “Do you ever wonder why he left?”
“Yeah, but after all these years I've stopped asking myself why because I'm not gonna find the answer. He's gone and I'd rather he didn't come back.”
“And if he did?”
I clench my jaw. “I'd make him wish that he made a big mistake coming back here.”
When me and Sam arrive at school, we both part ways to our lessons; Sam making her way towards Math while I make my way towards Biology. I quietly walk to my desk at the front but realize that Max hasn't arrived yet.
Maybe he's running late?
He's probably missed the bus or something. I'd understand if he didn't come after what happened to him yesterday. I can't help but picture Max's beaten face, and it makes me want to check up on him to see if he's okay.
As Mr. Thompson enters the classroom, he places his brown leather briefcase on his desk, and claps his hands to gather the attention of his students.
“Good morning everyone. For today's session, I'd like everybody to do some individual revision for the test next week. Any questions, just ask me.” Mr Thompson looks around the classroom, nods to himself then turns to sit behind his desk and starts up his laptop.
Through the hour of Biology, I couldn't concentrate looking over my notes I'd written on the variations of genetics and gave up halfway through the lesson to watch the clock ticking instead.
I sigh in contempt when I hear the bell that signals the end of lesson, I couldn't stand to sit at my desk any longer. I gather my notes and walk out of the classroom to head to my next class. English.
As I round the corner I see Sam huddled over her phone with a huge grin on her face.
“Did Bane finally send you a friend request on Facebook?” I nudge Sam as I stand next to her waiting for Mr. Edmund to arrive.
She pouts. “Still waiting for that too, but I've found something better.”
I arch my brows. “What did you find?”
Sam lowers her phone and looks at me. “Do you want to go to a house party tonight?”
Those were not the words I expected her to say. “Is someone we know throwing a party?”
I don't really know that many people in this school, so it's most likely one of Sam's friends.
“Kind of.” She bites her lip. “Oh God, whose party is it?”
Sam clears her throat and mumbles as she looks away from me.
“Sam!?”
“Don't get pissed off with me!” “Whose party is it!?”
“Alright! It's at Ryder's house! I really really want to go! Please come with me Alice!”
Sam is practically begging me and she's causing a scene in front of our class.
Just as I'm about to respond to her, Mr. Edmund rounds the corner in his navy pea coat and black slacks. For a teacher he actually dresses quite smart.
He unlocks the classroom door and ushers everyone in. He waits in front of the classroom and stands opposite my desk with a smirk on his face. I take my seat when
suddenly the whole classroom goes silent, I understand why when I look up to see Ryder and his crew enter the room.
Mr. Edmund watches them very closely as they sit in their seats.
“Was I not clear yesterday?” Mr. Edmund's voice gathers everyone's attention.
The class remains silent.
I think about what Mr. Edmund's referring to and think about what happened in yesterday's lesson. The only events I can remember yesterday was the change, the fight with Ryder and Max's injuries.
Mr. Edmund looks at me with disappointment.
“Can someone remind me what I said yesterday before I had to leave to deal with an important matter?”
I peak a glance at Ryder to see him lounging in his seat watching Mr. Edmunds' every move. He looks worn out but my attention is drawn back to the front when I hear my name being called out.
“Yes, sir?”
He crosses his arms against his chest and moves to stand right in front of my desk. “What did I tell everyone not to do before I left this classroom?”
I don't know! I can't remember!
I clear my throat and shake my head. “I don't know.”
He tilts his head and frowns. “You don't know?” “No, sir.”
Minutes go by and no one says a word.
Then out of nowhere, Mr. Edmund slams his fist down on my desk that creates a loud deafening sound echo throughout the whole class.
He stares at me a little longer, shakes his head then goes to stand directly in front of Ryder's desk.
“Mr. King, do you remember what I said yesterday?” Mr. Edmund places his hands on his hips, showing no sign of the fact that he's hurt himself.
Ryder remains silent.
“Surely you can remember? No?”
I look towards Ryder to see him scowling at the teacher. “I'm not fond of the silent treatment, Ryder.”
Mr. Edmund leans right into Ryder's face. “I mean, is it really that hard to remember what I said? I'll take that as a yes! Are you deaf? Incompetent or just lazy?”
Again, Ryder says nothing.
“You disappoint me Ryder, just like Alice here.”
Mr. Edmund waits a little longer at Ryder's desk then strides towards Bane's desk.
“And what about you Bane? Will you be the one to tell me what I said yesterday?”
Bane looks at him with distaste. “Nope.”
Mr. Edmund chuckles and walks to the classroom door. “Seeing as this lesson has not gone to plan, class is dismissed.”
Students begin to gather their things and rush to leave the classroom. I look at Sam in confusion to see her smiling as she gets up from her seat and leaves the room. She's probably waiting for me outside the class so that she can beg me to go to the party with her tonight.
Just as I get up from my chair, Mr. Edmund closes the door so all that's left in the classroom is me, and the four wolves.
“You three can keep me company at detention starting from 2:30 in here.” He then looks at Kellan and Silver. “You two clearly know how to listen better than these three.”
He smirks as he opens the door. “Hopefully this time you won't forget, otherwise there will be serious consequences.”
I couldn't eat during lunch break. The thought of eating anything made me feel nauseas. Sam kept begging me and begging me to go tonight and after continuously saying no to her, she just wouldn't give up. I gave up after the hundredth time and told her that I would go, but only for a little while. To say that she was happy was an understatement. She screamed so loud in the cafeteria, everyone was staring at her.
After lunch, Sam told me that she'd be leaving early in preparation for tonight because she wants to look perfect for Bane even though she looks pretty good in absolutely anything.
At 2:30, I arrive in our English class where detention is being held. I open the door to see Mr. Edmund already in his chair.
He indicates for me to enter and have a seat.
I take my usual seat in the front and wait for further instructions.
After last night, I thought a part of me would feel different, like I'd be able to hear and smell things that no ordinary person could do, but nothing.
The door opens and in walks Ryder followed by Bane.
Ryder pulls the chair out placed next to me while Bane sits on his own at another desk.
Mr. Edmund stands from his chair and stares at each of us individually. “Yesterday, you three decided to disobey my orders by leaving this very classroom. Therefore you will stay here until the end of the day. I will allow you to speak, but you will not, I repeat not be allowed to move from this room. Do I make myself clear?”
Neither Bane nor Ryder say a word. I quietly murmur. “Yes, sir.”
As Mr. Edmund sits, I take out my notes for Biology and pretend to look over them to make myself look busy.
Ryder lounges in his chair with one leg propped on the other while Bane puts his head on the desk.
“You okay?”
I swivel my head towards Ryder. “I'm fine.” A moment of silence. I turn back to my notes. “Are you sure?”
“Mhm.”
Another moment of silence.
“Are you just gonna sit there and ignore me?”
“I'm not ignoring you. I'm just revising for my test.” He scoffs. “Sure, I know what you're doing.”
“And what exactly is that.” My focus remains on the paper.
“Don't pretend that last night never happened because it did.”
I face him, my voice rising a little. “Nothing happened so just forget about it!”
Mr. Edmund's head rises from the papers in front of him. “Shush!”
“Keep telling yourself that Alice because we both know you wanted me.”
“It was a mistake!” I hiss.
Ryder looks angrily at me, shoves himself out of the chair and throws his chair to the back of the class.
Mr. Edmund remains seated in his chair with a look of boredom on his face.
“Get the chair and sit down Mr. King.” “Nah, screw this.”
He calls Bane and they both leave the classroom.
I sit in shock just as Mr. Edmund casually walks to the front of my desk.
“Let today be the first warning Alice, because disobedience is not tolerated in my classroom. Ever. Those two will definitely not be returning to this class after their behaviour this evening. One thing I will tell is that I would carefully advise you to think about who you surround yourself with.” He turns back to his desk. “You are dismissed, Alice.”
I quickly gather my things and rush out of the classroom.
At the end of the day, I decide to surprise my mother at the hospital with an early supper. My mother adores Chinese food but working night shifts she barely has the chance to eat any. I stop by at the reception to give them my name and my reason for being there, when I see a recognisable face reading a magazine.
“Max?”
He pauses for a minute then decides to look up at me. I'm taken aback when I don't see any bruises on his face or any sign of the crutches he had with him yesterday.
“Oh...hey Alice.”
He remains seated in the chair.
“You look much better than you did yesterday.”
There are no words I can manage to formulate. Max was beaten to a pulp yesterday and he looks very much unscathed.
“Yeah, my mom has healing powers.” He nervously chuckles.
I look down at his leg to see no cast either. “And your leg?”
He shrugs. “My mom can fix anything. I told you yesterday that it was nothing to worry about. Look at me, I'm fine.”
I frown, trying to come up with a reasonable explanation on how he's gone from looking like a beaten up rag doll, to looking completely fine, but I come up empty handed.
“So what brings you here?”
I show him the Chinese that I've brought to my mother. “I've brought my mum dinner. What brings you here?”
“I'm giving a ride home to my mother.”
I nod in understanding when I hear my mother calling my name. “Alice! What a surprise!”
I hug my mother tightly. “Yeah, I brought you your favourite Chinese, seeing as you never have the chance to eat on the weekends.”
My mother smiles. “Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.”
“When do you get off work?” “Late, sweetie.”
As always.
She takes the bag from me and kisses my forehead. “Do you have plans with Sam tonight?”
“There's a party tonight and I told her I'd go but...”
“No buts! You're going! It's the weekend and you deserve to have some fun, alright?” She hugs me again and leaves.
“There's a party tonight?” Max asks from behind me.
“Yeah, but it's at Ryder's house.” I face Max as he stands from his chair.
“Do you think I could come with you?”
“For someone that was beaten up by them, you don't seem that bothered.”
He shrugs. “What's the harm in attending their party, right?”
“Are you sure you wanna go?”
“Yeah! Why not? It's not like anything is going to happen!”
And so we both leave.
Chapter 13

The first thing I do when I leave the hospital is text Sam for the address of the party. The sensible side of me would be to not text her and go home where I can sit down with a good book or catch up with homework. After this week, I feel that going tonight to the party and having a few drinks couldn't hurt anybody because for once in my life, I can let my hair down and enjoy myself.
I won't have to worry about changing unexpectedly, I've proven all that I needed to prove, so for that I won't let anything stop me from having somewhat of a good time.
“So whereabouts is this party?” Max asks as he takes out his car keys and twirls them around his fingers.
“I don't know, but I've texted Sam to ask where it is because she's probably there right now dancing on the tables or something.”
He chuckles. “Is that something she does at every party?”
I shiver against the gust of wind that passes by which makes me rub both of my hands together. “She likes to have fun which is the complete opposite of me.” I sigh and shake my head in despair. “I don't even know why I'm going to this party. I mean I hate social activities.”
Max takes off his leather jacket and places it around my shoulders. “Here, this will keep you nice and warm.”
He presses the button to unlock his black Range Rover, stands on the passenger side, places his hand on the door and looks at me. “You're going tonight because you wanna look out for your friend, and that makes you a good person. Maybe you know deep down that she needs someone to look after her.”
I consider his words and slowly nod.
He opens the door of the car and waits for me to sit so that he can close it behind me. In that moment I get a text from Sam with the address. I show it to Max as soon as he closes his door.
The first thing I notice when we arrive closer to our destination are the cars lined up along the pavement and the people scattered everywhere along the property. I see people dancing, drinking and even some already passed out.
I get out from the car and walk alongside Max towards the house, the music playing so loud I can recognize the song from inside.
The house is hidden like the trees are purposely hiding it from view. I can't imagine what Ryder's house must look like.
I look around to see nothing but trees and it instantly makes me wonder what lurks beyond these woods.
Max and I follow a path that leads further into the woods, I place my hands in his jacket to keep warm when suddenly I inhale the intoxicating aroma of musk and pine needles overrunning the fresh air.
I walk a little farther, come to the clearing of the woods when I see the flickering flames of a campfire. I look at each person individually but see no recognizable faces.
We pass the campfire without a backward glance and slowly reach the house.
Wow...
The only word that comes to my mind when I look at this house is utterly breath-taking. The house is surrounded by glass and from the exact spot to where I'm standing, I can see everything. From here I see people dancing together, playing beer pong and some even doing body shots.
Hopefully Sam wasn't embarrassing herself in there.
I decide to go inside before changing my mind and take the stairs two at a time. Max can choose whether to follow or stick around outside but I have someone that I need to find. I push through the bodies that are in my way, to which I receive dirty looks and murmurs that are too quiet for me to understand. I finally get myself into the living room where I see a lot of people kissing and some doing things that I wish they could take outside.
People dance in the middle of the room but Sam is nowhere to be seen. I look behind me to see Max pushing his way through with the look of annoyance on his face, I call out his name but it's drowned out by the sound of music.
Having looked around the living area more than once, I decide to look for Sam in the kitchen, and the first thing I see is a stunning girl propped up on the steel counter wearing a tight silver dress covered in sparkles. The minute Silver's eyes meet mine she rolls her eyes.
“If you're trying to get Ryder's attention, he won't spare you a glance dressed like that.”
She takes in my black skinny jeans, the band t-shirt and leather jacket.
I ignore her and get right to the point. “Have you seen Sam anywhere?”
“Why would I care about where your annoying little friend is?”
She picks up the solo cup next to her and drains the whole thing.
“Because I'm trying to look for her, and I'd really appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction?”
Silver gets down from the counter and sways seductively to stand in front of me. “Sure I'll point you in the right direction. Go find Sam yourself, leave this house and stay away from what's mine, otherwise I'll kick your ass.”
I look at her in confusion. “What are you talking about?” “Stay away from Ryder.”
“I couldn't care less about him. All I want to do is find Sam because she came on her own, and I just wanna see if she's alright.”
“Look little wolf. You have no business here so take your blonde trash ass and get the hell off my property.”
“I'm not going anywhere until I find Sam.” She sighs, 'You never listen, do you?'
Suddenly, Max comes to joins us in the kitchen with relief written on his face. “I didn't know how to get through without pissing somebody off.”
Silver sneers at Max. “What the hell do you think you're doing?”
“What?” Max looks taken aback.
“Who said you could come to this party?” She places her hands on her hips.
“Well, I thought that if someone's throwing a party, then everyone's obliged to come.”
Silver tuts. “You thought wrong new guy, and for that you better watch out before someone really shows you how things are done around here.”
Max squares his shoulders and approaches her. “Silver, isn't it?”
She arches her brow in confirmation.
“See, where I come from, people don't usually talk like that and get away with things. I may not be good enough to pass as being a cool or a tough guy, but at least I have the decency to treat others with respect. Fair enough if you don't like me, because truth be told I'm not utterly fond of you either. So, the next time you threaten me or anyone I care about Silver, you won't like the outcome. That I assure you.”
