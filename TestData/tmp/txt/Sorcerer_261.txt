“Okay,” said Gatril. “You know Kiran, you’re starting to sound like a real sexplorer.”
“No,” said Kiran. “I always ask nicely for their queex first. The last beast was killing and eating innocent people, like the popobawa are. I’ve never killed anyone either.”
Gatril didn’t protest any further, but said, “Well we better get some rest. I think it’s best we do it tomorrow night after we’ve recovered.”
“You’re both welcome to stay with me if you want,” said Aparna. “I have enough space in my room that I booked.”
“Really? Thanks!” said Kiran. 
“No problem,” said Aparna. “It’s a pleasure to help a fellow practitioner of magic.”
Gatril groaned and rubbed her head. “Ah, I’m not too fancying going into human territory every minute. I know this question might sound off topic, but isn’t there a place where humans and beasts get together?”
Kiran folded his arms and looked at the ground as he tried to figure out something that could help. “Hmph.” Kiran unfolded his arms and looked at the two women. “There’s a place called a Furshack where humans and beasts meet, but that’s way on the north coast where the ships dock. Even if we could afford to refuel my quacycle, it will take around five days to reach there.”
Gatril frowned. “Nah, forget it. We don’t have enough resources or tools to defend ourselves. Let’s just finish up with your task and then we’ll get a move on. I’ll just stick around here by myself.”
“Are you serious?” said Kiran. 
“Boy,” said Gatril, “I’ve been living on my own for years. This won’t be anything.” Gatril abruptly pulled close and whispered in his ear. “Now go and have some fun with your new friend here. But make sure she washes the semen out of her mouth first.”
Kiran frowned at her. “Really, Gatril?”
“Stop being a wimp and let’s get going,” Gatril said, walking back to the quacycle with the others.
Kiran towed the vehicle next to him in a walking pace with the two females. Once they were close to the town, Gatril gestured a few trees that she would mark as the checkpoint for Kiran to meet her outside.
Aparna took Kiran by the hand and lead him through the streets, careful to avoid the prostitutes, police, back-alley merchants and other unscrupulous characters lurking about. Kiran’s interest in his new, taller companion wasn’t subtle either, as he kept sneaking stares at her face and chest. But it wasn’t by the influence of his hormones either, for he wondered what kind of magic she possessed in her arsenal.
They came to a white building that was the inn. Inside Aparna showed the receptionist her key and they allowed her and Kiran upstairs to the rooms.
“Right here, Kiran,” Aparna said as she brought them to a door at the end of the hallway, next to a window that glowed white from the sunlight.
Aparna opened the door and they went inside. The walls were made from clay, polished and painted in a beige color. The caretakers had put more effort in making the walls and ceiling more ornate, and the room carried a sweet scent of vanilla.
Aparna turned to Kiran and said as she took off her knapsack and cloak, “Make yourself comfortable.”
“…Sure.” Kiran put down his knapsack on the table next to Aparna’s and took off his shoes. 
He saw that one of the beds was untouched and chose that one to lay down in—and abruptly looked up when he saw Aparna stripping down to nothing but her underwear. Aparna’s slender frame manage to have enough curves to entice Kiran, and her bottom, though small, was well rounded.
Kiran realized his eyes weren’t coming off her and he closed them, finally looking away. Aparna hung her clothes on a rack and took out a beaded necklace from a drawer. “So Kiran,” she said, sitting on the other bed and looking across at him, “what kind of spells have you gathered so far?”
Kiran, relieved they had a productive conversation at hand, reached for his staff at the bedside and showed her the orbs. “These are all hardened queex from monsters. This is Gatril’s, this is from a lamia and the other is from a Riverwench.”
“You really fought a Riverwench?” Aparna said.
“Sure did,” said Kiran. “The first orb is a force-counter spell. The second one is an earth-pillar spell, and the third pulls water from the atmosphere; for when I’m travelling and run out of something to drink.”
“That’s resourceful,” said Aparna. “You know, those spells can be created in other ways with similar materials, right?”
“I know,” said Kiran. “But my grandfather told me that in the old days, before magic merchants got tons of the materials and started selling it, wizards had to find their ingredients the old fashion way. And my grandfather says I’ll need the combat experience.”
“Doing it old school, huh?” Aparna said.
“Yep,” Kiran replied. “So what kind of spell do you have?”
Aparna gestured with the necklace. “Mostly charms, like this one. It wards off hexes from other people. Each of these white beads can absorb a hex, but they turn to dust afterwards. In that case I would need to make a new one. I had to buy the ingredients for this once. It costed a lot, so that’s why I’m trying the old school way, like you.”
“Okay,” he said. “And the zebra semen, what will you do with that?”
Aparna said, “If I add some sand and onions, I can harden it into a crystal that will enable me to sense vibrations on solid surfaces.”
Kiran realized something about the two spells Aparna mentioned, something he read about and also told to him by his grandfather. “Aparna, your spells, they’re passive ones, aren’t they?”
“That’s right,” she said, amused Kiran was able to deduce it. “These spells actively feed off the user’s spirit energy and are active even when the user doesn’t think about it, so long as their spirit energy has not been diminished. While active ones, like your force-counter and earth-pillar, rely on you to command it in your mind and channel your spirit energy manually. But the Witching Tournament is also about flashy spells, so my next two will give me enhanced strength and the ability to make things float.”
“It looks like you’re going for a close-combat type of combination,” said Kiran.
