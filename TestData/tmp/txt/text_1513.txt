Sam takes a sip of her tea.
I find myself not having anything to say to that, I just grab my mug of tea and take a sip.
“You can stay here tonight if you want.”
I place my mug back on the table and sigh. “You won't mind? I haven't been the best company tonight.”
Sam looks at me with shock. “Alice, you went through hell tonight and it's not your fault. Blame the wolf that bit you.”
“I don't wanna be like this forever, Sam. What if there's a cure out there somewhere?”
Sam shakes her head. “Alice, I don't think there will be. This new part of you is gonna be with you for the rest of your life, and somehow you're just gonna have to accept it, even if you don't want to.'
I stifle a yawn and nod. “Yeah, I guess you're right but I still can't believe this is happening to me. It's just not right.”
Sam smiles reassuringly at me. “There's nothing wrong with being what you are even though it's gonna change your life. You should embrace it.”
