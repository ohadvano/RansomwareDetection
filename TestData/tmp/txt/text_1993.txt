He looks from the paper and smiles. “That's pretty cool.”
Just as Max finishes speaking, Mr. Thompson claps his hands to the classroom.
“Right, today I thought we could do something a little different. Now because we have Max here who has just started, I don't think it's fair on him to come to school today to jump right into today's subject, so I'd like everyone to read section A to C and write notes about variations of genetics so that you're all prepared for next week's quiz.”
Mr. Thompson walks up to our desk and looks at the two of us individually, “Now, Alice, I know you've already done notes on genetics and so on, so if you can print out your notes and give them to Max here at some point today, then he'll be sorted for next week.”
He looks at Max. “Other than that I hope you have a good day. Alice here can take you around the campus to see where everything is, and if I remember correctly, you have the gym and basketball at the end of the day. Alice can take you to where that is if it's alright with her, okay?” He claps his hands again, walks back to his desk and starts typing on his computer.
“He can talk, can he?” Max chuckles. “Yeah, he's a great teacher.”
“You like him?” Max raises an eyebrow and I burst out laughing.
I grimace. “Oh god, not like that! It's more of the way that he teaches that makes him such a likeable person. He shows so much passion in his job and you can clearly see that he loves teaching, and to me, that's the way people should be.” I look away from Mr. Thompson to Max and see that he's smiling at me.
“What?” I slowly wipe my nose and fidget with my hair. “Do you think it will be okay if I joined you for lunch?” “Huh? Oh yeah, sure. My friend would love to meet you.” Sam is going to love him!
