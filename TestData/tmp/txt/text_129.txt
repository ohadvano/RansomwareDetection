I turn to face him to see him biting his lip with his eyes fixed on me, I pull my shirt down to cover myself. “What's the matter?” He strides over to me.
There's no way I'm getting close to him like that again. “You don't want me?”
I'm walking backwards having no idea what's behind me. “Don't ever touch me like that again.”
When my back meets Sam's dresser, I quickly place my arm in front of me to stop Ryder from coming any closer.
He grabs my wrist and pulls it towards his chest.
As he walks towards me with my hand still on his chest, I feel my hand descending downwards and before I know it, Ryder's right in front of me.
“What do you think you're doing?” I look down at the floor.
He places a fingertip under my chin and lifts it up. “Doing what I should have done a long time ago”
Ryder reaches down and places his hands behind my legs. “What's that supposed to mean?”
