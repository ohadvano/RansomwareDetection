
of the physician if he thought his daughter's case hopeless.

The physician then inquired in regard to the nature and length of the sickness of

those who had died. The father mournful y related the painful facts connected with the

il ness of his loved ones. "My son was first attacked with a fever. I cal ed a physician. He

said that he could administer medicine which would soon break the fever. He gave him

powerful medicine, but was disappointed in its effects. The fever was reduced, but my son

grew dangerously sick. The same medicine was again given him, without producing any

change for the better. The physician then resorted to stil more powerful medicines, but my

son obtained no relief. The fever left him, but he did not ral y. He sank rapidly and died.

The death of my son so sudden and unexpected was a great grief to us al ,

especial y to his mother. Her watching and anxiety in his sickness, and her grief

occasioned by his sudden death, were too much for her nervous system, and my wife was

soon prostrated. I felt dissatisfied with the course pursued by this physician. My

confidence in his skil was shaken, and I could not employ him a second time, I cal ed

another to my suffering wife. This second physician gave her a liberal dose of opium,

which he said would relieve her pains, quiet her nerves, and give her rest, which she

much needed. The opium stupefied her. She slept, and nothing could arouse her from the

death-like stupor. Her pulse and heart at times throbbed violently, and then grew more

and more feeble in their action, until she ceased to breathe. Thus she died without giving

her family one look of recognition. This second death seemed more than we could endure.

We al sorrowed deeply but I was agonized and could not be comforted.

My daughter was next afflicted. Grief, anxiety and watching, had overtaxed her

powers of endurance, and her strength gave way, and she was brought upon a bed of



121

suffering. I had now lost confidence in both the physicians I had employed. Another

physician was recommended to me as being successful in treating the sick. And although

he lived at a distance, I was determined to obtain his services,

This third physician professed to understand my daughter's case. He said that she

was greatly debilitated, and that her nervous system was deranged, and that fever was

upon her, which could be control ed, but that it would take time to bring her up from her

present state of debility. He expressed perfect confidence in his ability to raise her. He

gave her powerful medicine to break up the fever. This was accomplished. But as the

fever left, the case assumed more alarming features and grew more complicated. As the

symptoms changed, the medicines were varied to meet the case. While under the

influence of new medicines she would for a time, appear revived, which would flatter out

hopes, that she would get wel , only to make our disappointment more bitter as she

became worse. The physician's last resort was calomel. For some time she seemed to be

between life and death. She was thrown into convulsions. As those most distressing

spasms ceased, we were aroused to the painful fact that her intel ect was weakened. She

began slowly to improve, although stil a great sufferer. Her limbs were crippled from the

effect of the powerful poisons which she had taken. She lingered a few years a helpless,

pitiful sufferer, and died in much agony.11

After this sad narrative the father looked imploringly to the physician, and entreated

him to save his only remaining child. The physician looked sad and anxious, but made no

prescription. He arose to leave, saying that he would cal the next day.

The next day the physician was in the sick room, standing by the bedside of the

afflicted daughter. Again he left the room without giving medicine. The father, when in the

presence of the physician alone seemed deeply moved, and he inquired impatiently, "Do

you intend to do nothing? Wil you leave my only daughter to die?" The physician said, "I

have listened to the sad history of the death of your much loved wife, and your two

children, and have learned from your own lips that al three have died while in the care of

physicians, while taking medicines prescribed and administered by their hands. Medicine

has not saved your loved ones, and as a physician I solemnly believe that none of them

need, or ought to have died. They could have recovered if they had not been so drugged

that nature was enfeebled by abuse, and final y crushed. He stated decidedly to the

agitated father. "I cannot give medicine to your daughter. I shal only seek to assist nature

in her efforts, by removing every obstruction, and then leave nature to recover the

exhausted energies of the system" He placed in the father's hand a few directions which

he enjoined upon him to fol ow closely. "Keep the patient free from excitement, and every

influence calculated to depress. Her attendants should be cheerful and hopeful. She

should have a simple diet, and should be al owed plenty of pure soft water to drink. Bathe

frequently in pure soft water fol owed by gentle rubbing. Let the light and air, be freely

admitted into her room. She must have quiet, and undisturbed rest."

The father slowly read the prescription, and wondered at the few simple directions it

contained, and seemed doubtful of any good resulting from such simple means. Said the

physician, "You have had sufficient confidence in my skil to place the life of your daughter

in my hands.â€ Withdraw not your confidence, I wil visit your daughter daily, and direct you

in the management of her case. Fol ow my directions with confidence, and I trust in a few

weeks to present her to you in a much better condition of health, if not ful y restored."

The father looked sad and doubtful, but submitted to the decision of the physician.

He feared that his daughter must die if she had no medicine. At a later date the daughter

was sitting by the side of her father cheerful and happy, with the glow of health upon her

countenance. The father was looking upon her with happy satisfaction, his countenance

speaking the gratitude of his heart, that his only child was spared to him. Her physician



122

entered, and after conversing with the father and child for a short time arose to leave. He

addressed the father, thus, "I present to you your daughter restored to health. I gave her

no medicine that I might leave her with an unbroken constitution. Medicine never could

have accomplished this. Medicine deranges nature's fine machinery, and breaks down the

constitution, and kil s, but never cures. Nature alone possesses the restorative powers.

She alone can build up her exhausted energies, and repair the injuries she has received

by inattention to her fixed laws."

He asked the father if he was satisfied with his manner of treatment. The happy

father expressed his heart felt gratitude, and perfect satisfaction, saying, "I have learned a

lesson I shal never forget. It was painful, yet it is of priceless value. I am now convinced

that my wife and children need not have died. Their lives were sacrificed while in the

hands of physicians by their poisonous drugs."



GEORGE WASHINGTON: MEDICAL MARTYR





On December 13th, 1799, George Washington summoned his doctor after coming

down with a sore throat. His doctor bled him four times, injected him with poisonous

mercury, gave him more mercury by mouth, then blistered his throat with a compound of

vinegar and dead bugs. After enduring this torturous treatment for a single day, the Father

of Our Country begged his doctor to leave him alone and let him die in peace - which he

did, at 10:00 PM on December 14.



STATISTICS CONFIRMS HARMFUL USE OF DRUGS



100,000 deaths a year (over 300 per day), are caused by prescription

medications. This figure is only on those reported by hospitals or physicians.

Journal of the American Medical Ass. April 15, 1998



One would think that doctors contribute to a decrease in mortality rates. Ironical y,

however, the reverse happens. Statistics gathered during doctors strikes in 1973, 1976

and 1978 proved their absence coincided with decreased death rates. These are as

fol ows:



1973 - Israel 29 day physician strike - 50% less deaths reported by Jerusalem Burial

Society.

1976 - Columbia 52 day physician strike -35% decrease in deaths in BogotÃ¡,

Columbia confirmed by Morticians Association of Columbia.

1978 - Los Angeles Doctors went out on strike for two months and death rate fel by

35%. When they went back to work, the death rate increased by 40%.

In a 1980 American study, 20% of al patients admitted into hospitals suffered one

or more latrogenic episodes. This means one person out of five suffered from drug

reactions, negative reactions to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and ward

accidents. Medication errors were responsible for 11% of the mistakes!

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE





THE HEART

The human heart is red brown in color and weighs approximately 12 ounces. It is

about six inches long, and its widest point is four inches

across. It is more pear shaped than valentine shaped.

The great throbbing center of al human life and activity

is the heart. No other organ carries so much responsibility for

the rest of the body. When your heart is strong and healthy

the whole body benefits. When it is sick, the whole body

suffers. That is why it is so important for you to take care of

your heart.

Can a person strain his heart by overwork? No, it is

almost impossible to strain the healthy human heart by overwork. The heart is far more

likely to be damaged by disease and by poor habits of living than by any physical activity.

But once the heart has been damaged by disease, it may be necessary to avoid too much

activity. A heart that has been damaged can be strained beyond its limits.

The heart is a very efficient four-chambered pump, actual y two pumps, one to

move blood to the lungs, the other to push it out into the body. Every day it pumps blood

through 60,000 miles of blood vessels, and pumps enough blood to fil a 4,000 gal on

railroad car.

As long as you are alive, your heart never stops working. It has enormous reserve

powers to meet any crisis that may arise. If it has been damaged by disease, it repairs

itself while it works! If its valves become thickened because of some disease, such as

rheumatic fever, the heart wil thicken up its own muscular wal s to try to compensate for

any lack of efficiency. Even while your heart is working, its own muscle cel s are busy

selecting the materials they need for their own growth and repair.



PULSE RATE



Relatively little attention is paid these days to the heart rate or pulse. The heart

typical y beats 70-80 times a minute when an individual is sitting down. This adds up to

over 100,000 beats per day. However, under physical or mental stress the body requires

more oxygen and the heart accordingly steps up the pace to perhaps 150-200 beats a

minute.

Athletes have low pulses, especial y long distance runners, whose rates can

normal y be 35 to 40 beats per minute. Women's rates are general y higher than men's.

Children and babies have stil higher rates, from 80-150 beats per minute.

A healthy individual, who has a resting pulse rate of 70 beats per minute in

comparison with a weaker individual who has a resting pulse rate of 90 beats per minute,

wil not be over-taxing his heart. A difference

of 20 beats per minute over a 24 hour period adds up to 28,800 extra beats the weaker

individual's heart has to beat per day. Obviously, with everything else being equal, the

heart pumping away at a faster rate wil not last as long as one pumping at a slower rate.



125



The average individual has 51/2 quarts of blood and the normal heart at a normal

rate wil pump or recycle thousands of gal ons of blood every day.

The amount of blood pumped by the heart with each contraction can vary from 2 to

5 ounces per stroke. The heart with a high stroke volume and low pulse is a far stronger

and healthier organ than the heart with a low stroke volume and high pulse.

Since the heart has to beat 24 hours a day it has to get its rest in between beats.

The interval between beats is only half a second normal y, which seems like very little time

for the heart to rest and repair itself. But it's enough, and here's why. At the rate of 70

beats per minute the heart rests approximately half the time and works the other half. This

means that in a 24 hour period it gets 12 hours of rest. But if the heart rate goes up, the

extra beats take away from the rest period. So when your pulse is higher than 70 beats

per minute, your heart is working more than it is resting. At a rate of 90 beats per minute

it's on the job approximately two-thirds of the time and resting only one-third.



BLOOD PRESSURE



Blood pressure (BP) is the force the circulating blood exerts on the arterial wal s.

Blood pressure is categorized as systolic or diastolic blood

pressure.

They are expressed as: 120 Systolic pressure, 80 Diastolic

pressure.

The systolic pressure is the pressure the blood has against

the wal of the blood vessel while the heart is pumping or pushing

the blood. It is the maximum pressure the blood has on the arterial

wal at any one time. The diastolic pressure is the pressure the blood has against the wal s

of the blood vessel while the heart is resting. It is the constant pressure on the artery, or

the lowest pressure on the artery.

High blood pressure is general y defined as sustained elevated systolic and/or

diastolic blood pressure. There is no fixed dividing line between normal or abnormal The

World Health Organization recommends that your blood pressure stay below 140/90.

However, I have personal y observed that in Central America where the people have a

more natural diet and exercise more, that their blood pressures wil average around

110/60. This is what I consider a normal blood pressure.

Individuals with blood pressure of 140/90 or above were found to have a

substantial y increased mortality. 73% of the men and 81% of the women who died had

blood pressures of 140/90 or above. The higher the blood pressure, the higher the

incidence of sudden, unexpected death. After the age of 55 those with high blood

pressure had four times as many heart attacks and more than seven times as many

strokes(1). Contrary to most learned opinions, diastolic blood pressure is, apparently, not

more important than the systolic. The famous Framingham study showed that elderly

individuals with high systolic pressures had their significantly higher mortality rates than

contemporaries with lower systolic pressures.(2).





126





WHAT CAUSES HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?



High blood pressure is largely self-induced by the way we live. I believe there are

four major factors which cause high blood pressure. They are lack of water, poor diet, lack

of exercise, and stress. I want to cover each one in a general way as there are volumes of

material in each of these four areas linking them with high blood pressure.





LACK OF WATER



Our blood is over 78% water and when we do not drink enough water, (see chapter

on water), our blood becomes thick. And since the heart is a pump that circulates the

blood through out the body, when it has to circulate thick blood this is going to raise your

blood pressure. I have been able to lower many individuals blood pressure by simply

getting them to drink enough water.



DIET





Diet is a major factor in high blood pressure. Overeating,

which causes obesity, wil overburden al organs in the body

including the heart which can raise one's blood pressure.

Every pound of excess fat contains approximately 200 miles

of capil aries through which the heart has to push blood.

Sixty-two percent of the American people are overweight; that

is more than one out of every two people in the U.S. For

every extra pound of weight, you shorten your lifespan one

month; so someone 24 pounds overweight would die two

years sooner. If you are obese, you have a three times greater chance of having heart

disease. I also want to mention that smoking, drinking alcohol, coffee, tea, or any

caffeinated beverage, can raise your blood pressure. There is enough scientific literature

in print that confirms this. I won't elaborate in this area as I feel that the majority of those

who read this book are trying to live a better lifestyle, and have already eliminated these

harmful items.

Meat and animal products such as milk, eggs,

and cheese, al contain cholesterol which can cause an

arterial plaque build-up on the artery wal s. This wil

indirectly cause high blood pressure. Foods from the

plant kingdom such as fruits,

vegetables, grains, nuts, etc. do not

have any cholesterol.

A high fat diet wil also cause

high blood pressure. The average

American diet consists of 40% fat. According to many professionals in

the natural health field, the ideal diet wil consist of 10% fat, 10%

protein, and 80% carbohydrate. Many individuals do not realize that

there is more fat in a bottle of corn oil (which is 100% fat), than there is

in a steak (which is 65%-80% fat). These refined fats, such as corn oil,

are harmful to the body. It takes 12 ears of corn to make one

tablespoon of corn oil. This refined oil causes our bodies to produce

low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), which is the bad kind of



127



cholesterol(3). When we eat these refined oils, they coat our red blood cel s and make them

sticky. These cel s clump together and do not flow as wel , thus causing the blood

pressure to rise.

An excessive intake of salt can be related to high blood pressure. The average

American eats from 14 to 30 times more salt than he needs daily. We actual y need only

one-fifth of a teaspoon of salt per day. However, the average salt intake by an American

adult, according to figures released by the National Research Council, is between two and

one half to six teaspoons per day.



Recent studies have shown that salt is only a minor issue in high blood pressure.

Although salt restriction may lower blood pressure a few points, a growing number of

authorities on this subject say that only about 10% of the population would benefit

appreciably from this(4). Fats contribute to high blood pressure in a far greater degree than

the use of salt.



LACK OF EXERCISE





Movement is life. Inactivity is death. We live in a push button society which is

sending us to the grave years before our time. Exercise wil improve the tone of your

muscles and blood vessels, changing them from weak tissue to strong tissue. Exercise wil

increase the efficiency of your heart in several ways. It wil grow stronger and pump more

blood with each stroke and it wil lower your pulse rate and help lower high blood

pressure. Walking outdoors in the fresh air and sunshine is the simplest and best exercise

one can do. Low impact exercise such as walking, cycling, swimming or hiking is more

beneficial than high impact exercises such as jogging, basket bal , weight lifting, etc.



STRESS



Stress is almost inescapable in modern society and some

individuals are able to deal with it better than others. Stress was

once described by an individual as "being in the hands of any

rascal who chooses to annoy and tease me". When confronted

with a highly stressful condition, the mind and body function

together. Scientists know that a certain cluster of nerves in the

base of the brain regulates changes in heart rate, blood pressure

and rate of respiration during a stressful situation. The large

amounts of adrenalin and non-adrenalin that pour into the blood

stream during fight-or-flight causes the cel s of the heart muscle to burn oxygen at a very

high rate, thus raising blood pressure, pulse, etc. Recent studies have strengthened the

statistical link between stress and heart disease.

In a study of 150 middle-aged men, Swedish scientists found that those who

experienced a high degree of psychological stress were six times more likely to develop

coronary heart disease within five years than those who reported relatively little stress.

Many times we bring about stressful problems by not thinking and planning ahead or

making wrong choices.



HOW TO CONTROL HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE



By eating a completely natural diet and drinking a minimum of eight glasses of pure

soft water daily, more if you are overweight. By getting plenty of exercise daily, especial y

outside in the fresh air and sunshine, whenever possible. By taking time to rest physical y



128



and mental y every day with 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. By handling stressful

situations by taking them to God.



A very good food to use to lower blood pressure is raw garlic. I have found a way

to get it down if you are not real crezy about the taste and odor. Take and put one glass

of orange juice or lemon juice in a blender add two cloves of raw garlic and blend them up,

let them sit 20 minutes then strain and drink. A very good herb to use to lower blood

pressure is Hawthorne Berries. Always use distil ed water or Reverse Osmosis water

when making the herb tea. Bring water to a boil; remove from heat and add 1-2 tsp. herb

per 8 oz. of water. Cover and let steep 20 minutes or longer, then strain and drink. It's best

to have 2 or 3 cups daily. One in the morning when you first get up, one approximately

one hour before your noon meal and one right before you go to bed. Garlic is also good

for lowering blood pressure. Use only fresh raw garlic; take it with your meal.



WHAT ABOUT MEDICATIONS TO LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE?





Drugs are not the answer, for they have too many side effects

and are not natural. For sickness God gave us the herb of the

field. Since God created us, He knows what is best for us.



Tenormin is a drug that is given to lower blood pressure,

but the side effects listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference

(PDR) for this drug are many.



These are the possible side effects listed for Tenormin in

the PDR: heart attack, renal and hepatic disease, electrolyte

disturbances, can cause cancer, impairment of fertility, cold

extremities, leg pain, dizziness, fatigue, depression, diarrhea, nausea, wheezing, etc. If

you are taking a drug to lower your blood pressure, I would encourage you to look up the

side effects on the inter-net or go to your public library and have the Librarian help you

look up the medication you are taking in the Physicians'Desk Reference (PDR). You wil

be surprised at what you read.



STUDY CONFIRMS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATIONS KILL

MORE THAN THEY CURE



A large scale government funded Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT),

which was a study costing more than 150 mil ion dol ars, found that the coronary mortality

was 70% higher in a group of hypertensive patients that received aggressive treatment

when compared to a control group who received no treatment(5). Considering the potential

harm of Thiazide Diuretics, Dr. Freis recently chal enged the concept of drug therapy for

mildly hypertensive patients. In his editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine

entitled "Should Mild Hypertension be Treated?" he points out that the treatment could be

worse than the disease(6).

IMMUNE SYSTEM



This is one of the most important chapters in this book. I feel inadequate to try to

convey in words some of the complexities of our body's immune system. Because it is

important that you, the reader, ful y realize the vital role your immune system plays in

determining your health, I wil keep this subject as simple as possible.



WE CAN HINDER OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM BY



HAVING A BAD LIFESTYLE, OR WE CAN HELP



OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM BY HAVING A GOOD



LIFESTYLE.



The special work of our immune system is to keep our bodies healthy. If two

individuals visit in the home of a mutual friend suffering from a cold, and the fol owing day

one individual comes down with a cold, but the other does not, it is because the healthy

individual's immune system was high and was able to fight off the cold, whereas the other

person's immune system was low and could not fight off the cold.

Many, many things can lower our immune system; here are a few of them: eating

the wrong foods; not drinking enough water; not getting enough sleep; not getting enough

exercise; not getting enough sunshine; breathing poor quality air; being intemperate in any

area; living with guilt, fear, hatred, etc., and not taking your problems to God; using drugs;

eating between meals; not keeping warm; living in unsanitary conditions; working in a very

noisy atmosphere;... As you can readily see the list could go on and on; and in this

chapter I wil be covering just a few of those listed.



To keep our immune system up we have to have a clean, free flowing blood

stream. There are many different types of blood cel s in our body. Red blood cel s

comprise a third of al the cel s in the human body, about 20 tril ion in the average adult.

White blood cel s are larger but less numerous than red cel s, and there are approximately

20 mil ion in the adult body. The white blood cel s are the ones that play a major role in our

body's immune system, and are sometimes referred to as our warrior cel s; they are

responsible for apprehending and eliminating foreign substances.



While red cel s are buoyed along like cargo rafts as the heart pumps the serum,

white cel s function more like patrol boats. Under their own locomotion, they can change

direction to go after an invading molecule or cel . Whenever the body has an infection or

any problem, internal y or external y, the white blood cel s wil multiply rapidly, You may

have three to five times as many of them in the blood stream during infection as you would

have under normal conditions. If you had an infected cut, they accumulate at the point of

infection like an army to fight the invaders.



130



At the sight of the infection, where the battle is raging, there is heat, redness,

swel ing, and pain. This is cal ed inflammation and may result in the formation of yel ow

pus. This pus is made up mainly of dead white cel s, living and dead germs and broken

down tissue when the pus is cleared away, healing takes place. Poor health habits can

hinder our white blood cel s from doing their job. Let me share a few of these with you in

WATCH OUT! EATING SUGAR LOWERS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM!



Eating sugar wil paralyze and hinder your white blood cel s from fighting

off an infection. Eating twenty-five teaspoons of sugar wil paralyze 92%

of your white blood cel s for approximately five hours. The average

American eats 42 teaspoons of sugar per day. A banana split has 24

teaspoons of sugar. A 12 oz. Coke with a piece of chocolate cake and a

scoop of ice cream has 27 teaspoons of sugar. It is a shame to see a child who has a cold

with a bad cough and runny nose drinking a soda. He is lowering his immune system by

paralyzing his white blood cel s so that they cannot properly fight off the cold. (For more

information on sugar read chapter 37)



NOT DRINKING ENOUGH WATER LOWERS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.



A normal sized adult needs two quarts of pure soft water daily. Those who do not

drink enough water wil have problems with constipation, which causes a backing up of

waste materials in the body. Not drinking enough water causes the blood to become

thicker and this slows down the circulation throughout the whole body thus raising the

blood pressure. Insufficient water causes many health problems such as kidney and

bladder problems, skin eruptions, eye problems, etc. These problems wil put an overload

on the body, indirectly weakening it and lowering the immune system.



LACK OF SUNSHINE WILL LOWER THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.





Sunlight increases the production and stimulates the activity of the white blood

cel s. These cel s in turn produce more antibodies and interferons to circulate throughout

the body. The net effect is that the individual's defenses against disease are greatly

strengthened when one gets sunshine(1).

EATING MEAT LOWERS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM



Eating meat lowers the immune system as the meat has a large amount of waste

materials in it that the animal was unable to eliminate because it was slaughtered. This

waste material indirectly enters the blood stream causing a lot of extra work for the white

blood cel s as they have to destroy al the harmful bacteria etc..

It also puts an overload on the kidneys, liver, colon, and many

other organs in the body. It is a wel known fact that vegetarians

have a lower red blood cel count than do meat eaters. They

also have a lower white blood cel count because of their

stronger immune system. The vegetarian doesn't need as many

white blood cel s because he is not consuming meat which

contains large amounts of waste materials which would require

additional white blood cel s.



I have just listed four poor health habits that wil lower our

body's immune system; and, as mentioned earlier, the list could

go on and on. I want to now concentrate on what we can do to

build our immune system so that we wil not come down with al

of the western diseases we see today. In industrialized countries sickness abounds. Here

in America, one out of every three people die of cancer; one out of every two people die of

cardiovascular disease; every 50 seconds a few diabetic is discovered in the United

States. Why is there so much sickness in America today? The answer is poor lifestyle

habits, which lower the body's immune system causing disease.



WAYS TO BUILD THE IMMUNE SYSTEM DRINK PLENTY OF WATER



The earth is almost three-fourths water; fresh fruits and vegetables are also close to

three-fourths water; and the human body is close to three-fourths water. We therefore

need a lot of water every day. How much is a lot? If you weigh 160 Ibs. divide this in half

to get 80; this is how many ounces of water you need daily under normal circumstances. If

you are working out in the sun al day long you wil obviously need more. I only

recommend three kinds of water to drink: they are pure rain water, distil ed water, and

Reverse Osmosis water.





EXERCISE IN THE SUNSHINE AND FRESH AIR



It is better to wear out than rust out. Every muscle in our body needs exercise or it

wil deteriorate. Exercise also helps to relieve stress. Exercise outside

in the sunshine and fresh air is ten times more beneficial than indoors. I
