
check her mouth for mercury vapor. The level was so astronomical that, If she had been a

building, the Environmental Protection Agency would have had to condemn her and tear

her down. She had her mercury fil ings removed. In three weeks she threw away her cane,

her tremors stopped and the swel ing went out of her joints. She states that she is 95%

cured.

Nancy Yost of San Jose, California, was told by her doctors that she had multiple

sclerosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by tests and she was declared "incurable". She

had worked in the dental Industry and so knew about mercury toxicity. Her doctors had

told her to "get real" and not to expect too much out of life. In other words, give up.

As a last resort, she had her five mercury fil ings removed. She left the dentist's

office using a cane and leaning heavily on the arm of a friend. The next day she was able

to walk without a cane.

How could these disastrous situations have developed? Doesn't the Food and Drug

Administration protect us from such occurrences? Unfortunately, at least In the case of

dentistry, the answer is no. The ADA's dental division is stacked with people from the

American Dental Association who tel the ADA what to do where dental regulation is

concerned. There Is virtual y no medical input or basic science, such as toxicology,

represented on the ADA's dental board. So your health is in the hands of a bunch of

political dentists who know nothing about mercury toxicity. Perhaps this explains why the

ADA refused to be interviewed by 60 Minutes concerning the mercury amalgam Issue.



The dental silver-mercury amalgam has been in existence for 165 years. In the

United States in the 1840's, the American Society of Dental Surgeons required its

members to sign an agreement not to put amalgam in a patient's mouth. Members

violated their agreement, the Organization dissolved, and the American Dental



80

Association was born. Over 140 years ago some wise individuals realized the dangers of

the toxicity of amalgams which contain approximately 50% mercury.



Since then, the American Dental Association has been stonewal ing the issue of

mercury amalgam toxicity. In fact, until several years ago, the ADA said no vapor at al

was released from these fil ings. But when the public got wind of the fact that

mercury/silver fil ings can damage their health the ADA met the issue head on. It denied

that there was any danger and started persecuting (and prosecuting) dentists who strayed

from the party line.



Dentists have been taught that mercury stays within a filling and does not come

out.

If mercury stays tightly bound in the amalgam compound as dentists are taught

then five-or-ten year-old-fil ings would stil contain 50 percent mercury. They don't. Actual

tests show that they contain 25 to 35 percent mercury. Some 20-year-old fil ings have less

than 5 percent mercury. In 1979 researchers established that mercury does leach from

fil ed teeth. In fact, fil ings can be the largest single source of exposure to inorganic

mercury. The next step came when scientists showed that the escaped mercury winds up

in body tissues; autopsies at Sweden's Karol nksa Institute found in 1987 that some

people with silver fil ings had three times as much mercury in their brain, and nine times

as much In their kidneys, for Instance, as those without fil ings.



Ask your dentist If the country of Sweden has banned mercury

amalgam fillings!!! He'll tell you they have. Ask your dentist if the

American Council on Dental Materials and Devices recommends that

dentists: 1) Avoid any contact with mercury, 2) Handle It only In

tightly sealed containers, and 3) Perform annual mercury-level tests

on their staff and themselves. He'll tell you they have.



Dr. Heber Simmons, Consumer Adviser for the American Dental Association, was

asked by Morley Safer, "You concede that there is a constant release of mercury vapor

(from amalgam fil ings)?"

"Oh, we don't dispute that at al . (Remember, the ADA'S position til seven years

ago was to total y deny any vapor release.) But the amount that Is being released when

you chew is such a smal amount that it Is not going to cause a problem."

When asked to explain the remarkable recoveries we described earlier, Simmons

reported that the cases were anecdotal and clinical y insignificant.



WHAT ARE DENTAL AMALGAM MADE OF?



Although we refer to our fil ings as "silver", amalgam Is actual y made up of about

52 percent mercury, with the remainder being copper, tin, silver, and zinc. There is a

wealth of scientific documentation proving that al five elements affect al the major organs

of the body, including the kidneys, liver, heart, central nervous system, and Immune

system. The five metals contained in the amalgam can combine to produce some 16

different corrosion products, al floating around in the body with unknown effects.

RECOMMENDATION



Since dental amalgam contains approximately 50% by weight of mercury (a

substance that is highly toxic to humans) and since the workshop failed to provide

evidence to substantiate the safety of dental" amalgam, the International Academy of Oral

Medicine and Toxicology recommends the fol owing:

"That the governments of the United States and Canada declare an Immediate

prohibition on the further use of dental silver-mercury fil ings until primary scientific

documentation can be provided proving that the mercury released from dental fil ings Is

not harmful to the public."

Without a doubt, mercury is extraordinarily toxic to humans. According to the

Toxicity Center at the University of Tennessee, which rates poisons for their lethal toxicity

to humans scores mercury at 1,600, compared to Plutonium, the deadliest, at 1,900. This

rating places It among the most toxic substances known to man.

Mercury is more poisonous than lead, cadmium or arsenic. Yet, no dentist would

dream of packing your teeth with lead or arsenic. Inhaled mercury vapor is at least a

hundred times more toxic than swal owed mercury. Mercury vapor is what comes off your

teeth from the fil ings when you chew your food. This occurs multiple times a day every

time you eat or grind your teeth together. Also, a battery-like effect, resulting from two

metal fil ings touching each other, can cause a continuous release of mercury vapor into

your mouth.



Don't let your dentist reassure you with a blood-level test for mercury.

The test is not reliable and tells you nothing about the amount of

mercury that your body has stored over the years.



DENTAL AMALGAM KILLS FOUR





It was late August, 1989. The place was Michigan. Four people; two men and two

women who had lived in a private home, lay dead.

Just over three weeks before, they were hospitalized, complaining of chest pain,

diarrhea, nausea and shortness of breath. Their breathing became more labored and

difficult. Four days into their hospital stay, it was learned that one of the men living in the

house had been col ecting mercury amalgam dental fil ings. He had been heating up the

fil ings in the basement in order to extract the smal amount of silver in them to sel .

Aggressive medical procedures to remove mercury from their bodies along with

substantial respiratory support were initiated, but to no avail. Al four people died of

mercury poisoning.

The house in which the amalgam was heated was extensively cleaned in the hopes

of removing the mercury. The cleaning failed and the contaminated house was declared

unfit for habitation and had to be torn down. According to environmental guidelines, the

mercury laden rubble was disposed of as hazardous waste.

These unfortunate victims died from breathing mercury vapor from the identical kind

of fil ings that are In 200 mil ion Americans' teeth. It is estimated that 100 mil ion new

amalgam-fil ings containing mercury are placed In teeth each year in the U.S.

I am aware of no other material except mercury amalgam that is implanted daily in

our bodies by medicine or dentistry that can contaminate whole buildings and kil people

simply by being heated.





82

Even The World Health organization concedes that the public's highest daily

exposure to mercury comes from dental amalgam fillings.



MERCURY DISTRIBUTION



From the amalgams, mercury vapors may be breathed into the lungs then absorbed

by the bloodstream. The mercury particles and ions may be swal owed and absorbed from

the gastrointestinal tract into the circulatory system. Now, it may travel to just about any

and every tissue, organ and cel . Mercury's target organs are kidneys, cardiac muscle,

lungs, liver, brain, and red blood cel s. Others are thyroid, pituitary, adrenals, spleen,

testes, ovaries, bone marrow, skeletal muscle, and Intestines.

There's very strong evidence that mercury in ' dental fil ings can cause a broad

spectrum of symptoms and diseases. Everything from depression to arthritis may be

involved in a particular case; it's extremely variable. Mercury poisoning has been

implicated in Alzheimer's disease, colitis, kidney disease, birth defects, brain damage, and

symptoms of multiple sclerosis.
