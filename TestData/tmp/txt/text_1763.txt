“Should you be moving her? She doesn't look good at all and she looks really pale.”
“Sam! Where's your bathroom!?” Ryder yells.
“Upstairs, first door on the right.”
Sam follows Ryder every step of the way. “What are you gonna do?”
Ryder rushes up the stairs, into the bathroom and sits me down on the toilet. I can hardly keep myself upright, but Sam moves to hold my hand to steady me.
“We're gonna put her in the bathtub and fill it with cold water.”
He reaches over and turns the cold tap on then turns to me while the water runs. “You're gonna be alright.” He cups my cheeks. “I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.”
I can do nothing but stare at him. I try hard to say anything but stop when I realize that I can't. It's like I'm struggling to form words. Ryder notices and frowns at me.
With his hand, he opens my mouth and wheezes. “Her teeth are starting to break through.”
