I take it as a sign to follow him but for some reason, seeing Ryder run off like that stirs an unwelcome feeling inside me.
Can Ryder sense something that I can't?
I reach the clearing just after Ryder and notice the three wolves standing in a half circle - looking down at something in the middle of them. The wolves turn around as if sensing that their Alpha is in their company, but when Kellan spots me, he growls at me as if warning me away.
I ignore it and follow behind Ryder.
He stops and stares at the scene in front of him. My heart stops when I see that a body lies unmoving on the ground. A bloodied body of a man lies on his front.
With the face hidden from view, I have no idea who the dead body belongs too.
Kellan rushes to stand next to me, urging me to leave, but I have no idea why.
There must be a reason otherwise he wouldn't be doing this.
All the wolves have gone quiet, and when I reach over to turn over the lifeless body, I can fully understand why.
