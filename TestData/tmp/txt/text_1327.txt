“It was simple, I told Silver to get over it or she'll be kicked out from the pack.”
“Wow, I bet she took that well.” I say enthusiastically. After that, we finish eating our breakfast in comfortable silence. We don't talk about what might happen today or if something could go wrong, but I can only imagine the worst when it involves Max and Ryder.
After clearing the dirty dishes, I go up the stairs, into the bedroom and change into the sweats and t-shirt I wore yesterday. I don't think twice about how I look when I leave the house, and I find Ryder in a black sports car waiting for me. The moment I close the door and put my seatbelt on, we're on our way towards Max's house.
We arrive outside his house forty minutes later and throughout the whole journey, I kept asking myself if Ryder actually knew where Max lived. I know he's a wolf and all but can a wolf actually lead you to someone's house?
What am I talking about of course wolves can!
I take in the small bungalow in front of me and to be truthful I didn't expect Max to live in such a small and unkempt place. I'm not sure what I expected, but this is definitely not what I pictured.
I get out of the car with Ryder close behind and make my way towards the door. I look behind me and look at Ryder without any reason to. Maybe I'm looking at him for an answer on if we should do this or not, but when he nods at me to go on, I know I have my answer.
After knocking the first couple of times, there wasn't any sign of Max, I even called and texted him a few times to ask where he was but received no answer. When I start thinking about giving up, Ryder surprises me by moving me out of the way and kicking the front door.
“What the hell do you think you're doing? You can't just kick down someone's door!” I look around to see if anyone saw.
