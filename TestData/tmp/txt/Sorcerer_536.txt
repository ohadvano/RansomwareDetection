Kiran, relieved they had a productive conversation at hand, reached for his staff at the bedside and showed her the orbs. “These are all hardened queex from monsters. This is Gatril’s, this is from a lamia and the other is from a Riverwench.”
“You really fought a Riverwench?” Aparna said.
“Sure did,” said Kiran. “The first orb is a force-counter spell. The second one is an earth-pillar spell, and the third pulls water from the atmosphere; for when I’m travelling and run out of something to drink.”
“That’s resourceful,” said Aparna. “You know, those spells can be created in other ways with similar materials, right?”
“I know,” said Kiran. “But my grandfather told me that in the old days, before magic merchants got tons of the materials and started selling it, wizards had to find their ingredients the old fashion way. And my grandfather says I’ll need the combat experience.”
“Doing it old school, huh?” Aparna said.
“Yep,” Kiran replied. “So what kind of spell do you have?”
Aparna gestured with the necklace. “Mostly charms, like this one. It wards off hexes from other people. Each of these white beads can absorb a hex, but they turn to dust afterwards. In that case I would need to make a new one. I had to buy the ingredients for this once. It costed a lot, so that’s why I’m trying the old school way, like you.”
“Okay,” he said. “And the zebra semen, what will you do with that?”
Aparna said, “If I add some sand and onions, I can harden it into a crystal that will enable me to sense vibrations on solid surfaces.”
Kiran realized something about the two spells Aparna mentioned, something he read about and also told to him by his grandfather. “Aparna, your spells, they’re passive ones, aren’t they?”
“That’s right,” she said, amused Kiran was able to deduce it. “These spells actively feed off the user’s spirit energy and are active even when the user doesn’t think about it, so long as their spirit energy has not been diminished. While active ones, like your force-counter and earth-pillar, rely on you to command it in your mind and channel your spirit energy manually. But the Witching Tournament is also about flashy spells, so my next two will give me enhanced strength and the ability to make things float.”
“It looks like you’re going for a close-combat type of combination,” said Kiran. 
“It is,” said Aparna, getting up. “I’m going to brush my teeth. I have a spell book on the table you can check out if you want.”
“Oh, nice!” Kiran leapt up and towards the table. He snatched up the book and fell back in the bed. 
Kiran studied the texts in the book until Aparna got back. They delved into a conversation about which kind of magic combination was the most efficient, and recalled the most famous magic practitioners of past. No sex was brought up, not that Kiran was feeling particularly lusty, but more than once Gatril crossed his mind.
Three hours later they left the inn and decided to scout out the location of the forest, moving on foot to conserve the fuel of Kiran’s quacycle. Though Kiran walked around with Aparna, there were a few other foreigners in the town as well, easterners like Aparna and northerners whose light skin made them stand out like a giraffe amongst zebras.
Within little over half an hour they were able to find the street that ran from the heart of the town and into the forest. It also bore a small police port, were a few officers were stationed as lookout for potential smugglers and monsters, even incorporating a tower for an enhanced point of view.
Kiran and Aparna slowed their approach as an officer came to meet them. Kiran noticed his eyes paid more attention to Aparna, but he wasn’t surprised.
“Good afternoon children,” said the officer. “Where are you both headed?”
“Sir,” said Kiran, and the man switched his lustful gaze from Aparna to an annoyed one when he saw Kiran. “My name is Kiran Kehomba. I’m a sorcerer in training. I’ve come from my town to try and find popobawa parts for my spell. My friend her is accompanying me.”
“My name is Aparna,” she said. “I’m also a sorceress. We’re both trying to find resources to enter the Witching Tournament. I have a permit to enter this country and participate if you’d like to see.”
“Sure,” said the officer, “let me have them.”
Kiran and Aparna took out their IDs, and the officer gave Kiran’s a quick glance and handed it back to him. However, he carefully ran his fingers over Aparna’s hand as he took hers. She frowned and wiped her hands in her clothes, but the officer merely cackled and looked at her identification. “Aparna Borasing. Gabanyese, eh?”
“Yes,” she said. 
“Are we allowed to venture into the forest, sir?” said Kiran.
“…We don’t recommend it,” the man said thoughtfully. “If you do enter the forest however, you’ll have to sign a contract with the authorities giving your consent to be the ones solely responsible for your own wellbeing.”
“Sure,” said Kiran. “We’ll sign once we’re coming back. Come on Aparna.”
The young woman snatched her ID from the officer and followed Kiran back into town. They decided to take a walk along one of the factories to explore how far the advancements in technology in the country had gone. 
The facility was surrounded by a large fence of wooden posts, and through the large open door, the two could see trolleys and small carts carrying hunks of metal to and from the back.
Kiran looked up at the sign which read “Okoyo’s Engine Repair Service”. “Do you think they made a spell that can combine magic and machines?” said Kiran.
“Not to my knowledge,” said Aparna. “I don’t think that would even be allowed in the tournament either.”
“Would’ve been cool though,” Kiran said. “I know you have knights who are good at using gadgets.”
“Gadgets malfunction, spells don’t,” Aparna snapped. “Let’s go already. I still need to get the tingle of that policeman off me.”
Kiran shrugged and continued with Aparna back to the inn. While Kiran studied his book of spells once more, Aparna was just about finished with her knew spell, having gathered the ingredients to mix with the zebra semen and turn into an orb. She had a large bracelet with three sockets, one of which she fitted the orb into. Aparna channeled her spirit energy into the stone and locked the bracelet around her foot.
