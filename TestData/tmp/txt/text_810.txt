Chapter 23

I push through the hospital doors with only one thing on my mind, finding Sam. When I reach the reception area, there's not a single word I can utter but her name.
The receptionist looks at me worryingly. “Young lady? Are you alright?”
“Sam...” I repeat over and over.
Everyone stares at me in pity, they're probably wondering what the hell is wrong with me. No one would understand the shit I've been through this week.
My mother soon finds me, pulls me into her chest and that's when the tears start to fall again. We hold each other for a few minutes.
I break away from her, with a look of desperation in my eyes. I need to see Sam with my own eyes and maybe then I'll be able to speak.
She leads me through the hospital to where they're keeping her when unexpectedly, I see Ryder, Kellan, Bane and Silver standing outside her door, wearing expressionless looks on their faces.
