Jill ends her broadcast day and prepares to depart for home.
Producer Jack Ford: "So Jill, you are a comedian now?"
Jill: "In the Millennium I will be a stand-up comic. Want to be my Producer?"
Jack: "I will always be by your side.”
CHAPTER 31
ROME BURNS

On a ship in the Mediterranean Sea passing the island of Sicily, a container ship Captain is below deck giving final instructions to his crew as they head toward Rome to unload their cargo.  They have just returned from a month-long voyage picking up luxury goods for the elite in Rome. It is a lucrative business, and the clientele in Rome pays very well for his wares. When it comes to commerce, Rome is about the only remaining destination for any luxury goods. The rest of the world is barely surviving, trying to just get a little food and some water. But Rome has continued its excesses on the backs of the rest of the world, getting rich on the taxes taken in through the Mark of the Beast program. The container ship has just rounded the western tip of Sicily is now headed northward. Next stop, Rome.
Just then an enormous sound and wind blast comes across the bow of the ship, and it rocks vigorously.  The windows on the bridge are blown out, and the cargo shifts, leaving the boat listing to the port-side.  The Captain and crew come up out of the hold to the bridge to see a mushroom cloud ahead of them, obviously above Rome.  There was nothing else it could be. The crew collectively gaze in horror to see the sight, and think of the destruction.  The Captain also knows it means ruin for his business.  He invested everything in this cargo.  He is bankrupt.  At least his ship's bow was headed into the explosion, otherwise it would have capsized.  The crew is mostly alive, although the bridge is badly damaged and the crew in it at the time is gone -- blown overboard.  The ship is disabled and listing.  He thinks to himself that given the normal ship traffic, the death toll on the Mediterranean alone must be over 10,000.  But Rome had several million living there.  He decides to stop thinking and see what he can do for his ship and crew.
Ship radio traffic erupts, with emergency distress calls going out everywhere. Ships sank all over the Mediterranean, and many people are in the water. Communications are sketchy, as the EMP radiation has disrupted air-wave communications all over the area. Some web-based communications are operating. But generally there is chaos.
When Jill Steiner awakes the next morning, she learns the news of the destruction of Rome by a nuclear explosion. She hurries into the news studio to prepare for her morning news show. She thinks to herself: "It is all just as the Bible said it would be."
In the studio she describes the destruction of Rome and its aftermath. Producer Jack Ford puts up the video.
Jill: "Babylon, which is Rome, was destroyed today by a nuclear attack. It was targeted by the Western Alliance forces out of Germany. President Antivon gave the orders himself. He is currently on his way to the Middle East to review the military forces there."
Jill reads from her book:
Revelation 18:1 “After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. 2 With a mighty voice he shouted: “‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!’... 8 Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine.  She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her...‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls!  17  In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!’ ”
"The Bible predicted it would be destroyed "in one hour", showing a nuclear conflagration. The nuclear destruction and burning will be seen by those in ships from far off at sea. Those who relied on Babylon for religion and trade will be horrified, and they will mourn for their own loss of economic benefit."
The international trade and excesses of luxury and wealth will vanish in a flash. The false economy created by this false religion will crash. Total economic depression sets in. At this point all semblance of normalcy in the Antichrist’s kingdom vanishes, and all he has left is to wage war on a grand scale.
The people will focus on what they have lost in trade, not on what this means spiritually. Those who benefited from the mark of the Beast will now be bankrupted by it. But they will still refuse to turn to God.
Jill: "The mushroom cloud and smoke were visible from ships all over the north Atlantic Ocean. While the focus for all who saw the destruction was their economic ruin, which was tied to Babylon and its religious system through the Mark of the Beast. They mourn their loss of wealth, but fail to understand why this happened. This is God's judgment for killing believers who refused to accept the satanic false religion and refused to take the mark of the Beast."
Jill continues: "Rome falls silent.  No music, no tradesmen working, no grain being milled, no public utilities, no marriage or social life, no commerce or trade, no worshiping Satan, no more killing of God's believers.  The deceit of Satan's religious system is ended.  Only silence remains in Babylon.  Let us note Revelation 19:3 “And again they shouted: “Hallelujah!  The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever.”  This suggests that the mushroom cloud over Babylon will be immortalized as a monument to the victory of God over false religion."
With the destruction of Babylon and Satan's religious system by the 7th Bowl Judgment, Jesus Christ is now ready to return to earth at His Second Advent, deliver His people who are under siege, destroy the unbeliever armies massed in Israel including at Armageddon, finish the actions needed to start the Millennium, and then assume His rightful place as ruler of the earth during His 1000 year reign.
Within the next week a series of intense earthquakes occurred. The world seemed to be at its end. Unbelievers wished for death but could not find it. The world still refused to look to God as their answer.
CHAPTER 32
INVASION OF NORTH AFRICA

President Antivon is in southern Israel with his troops. He wants to personally oversee the invasion of his next prize, which will be Africa. He sees the Pyramids as part of the energy source for the harmonic convergence of the universe. To him they are aligned in a precise way to collect and disseminate the energy of the universe to a god, and that would be him. As it was for the Pharaohs, so it would be for him. He was their heir. He desperately wanted to "own" the Pyramids, and the rich mineral resources of Africa along with them.
The Western Alliance forces based in Jerusalem headed south into North Africa. The African nations were no match for the combined military forces of the West, and fell easily one by one. Egypt, Sudan, Libya and Ethiopia fell first, all within a week. After a short rest for his troops and new supplies, Antivon was preparing to order his forces further south into central Africa. He felt the power of the Pyramids flowing through him. He was invincible.
But unexpected news of a massive Eastern Alliance army marching west toward the Middle East reached him. At the same time, when the Northern Alliance saw the Eastern Alliance headed for the Middle East, they sent their forces southward to cut them off. The Southern Alliance forces from Middle East countries had already made a surprise advance on Israel, and were now at the border of northern Israel, leaving their own countries undefended. The armies of the world were all headed toward Israel.
Infuriated, Antivon ordered his combined Western Alliance military forces to turn around and head north at full speed to prevent the Northern, Eastern, and Southern Alliances from trapping his army in Africa. His forces drove hard, and within two days the bulk of his forces had exited Africa into southern Israel. The three other Alliances were all within a couple days of entering Israel from various directions, with the Southern Alliance already massed at the border waiting for the proper timing to cross over.
Jill Steiner had been reporting on the invasion of Africa, and now turned to covering the invasion of the Middle East by all four world Alliances. The stage was set for Armageddon. She quotes from the Old Testament:
Daniel 11:40 “[King of the West – Antichrist] will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood. 41 He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon [where Jews are in supernatural hiding] will be delivered from his hand. 42 He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape. 43 He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Cushites in submission. 44  But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many. 45  He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain [Jerusalem]. Yet he [Antichrist] will come to his end, and no one will help him.”
Satellite video shows the armies of the world all headed toward northern Israel. The Western Alliance is headed northward, having just departed from Egypt into southern Israel. The Eastern Alliance is shown headed through northern Iran and about to enter Iraq, while the Northern Alliance is headed south through Turkey and will then make its way through Syria. The Southern Alliance army is in Jordan on the border with Israel, having left their own countries unprotected as the Eastern Alliance storms through. They should all converge within the next few days. The destination for each one of them is northern Israel. They could not attack southern Israel and Jerusalem directly because the Western Alliance is too strong there.
Within the next several days the armies will all meet at the Jezreel Valley in northern Israel to do battle on the wide Plain of Esdraelon, near Megiddo, just south of Nazareth. The valley has become better known by a Hebrew and Greek word compilation combining "har" and "Megiddo," which means the "Hill of Megiddo," forming the word "Armageddon."  The stage is set for the bloodiest battle in all human history.
CHAPTER 33
PREVIEW OF TRUMPET #7 -- WOE #3

With Armageddon and the Second Advent of Christ close at hand, Jill Steiner is in her news studio telling her audience what is coming next.
Jill: "Six Bowl Judgments and six Trumpet Judgments have been completed. There are seven of each, so one Bowl and one Trumpet remain. Recall that the first six Bowls were inserted in between the sixth and seventh Trumpet Judgments, which is the “Third Woe” which is yet to come. The Third Woe includes events just prior to and during the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. So the Third Woe includes the last Trumpet and last Bowl. In other words, all that remains is the Grand Finale, a combination of the seventh Bowl and seventh Trumpet Judgments."
After a brief pause Jill adds "I can't believe I just said all of that."
Jill continues: "The armies of the world have gathered to attempt to destroy Israel and the Jews, but instead have ended up facing each other at Armageddon. It is at this point when the Lord will return. The Second Advent is not so much a single event as a series of events which occur as Jesus Christ returns and completes the task of cleansing the earth from evil in preparation for His rule during the Millennial Kingdom. His first task will be to destroy the assembled armies which have invaded Israel.  Jesus Christ will very soon return to earth at His Second Advent, deliver His people who are under siege in Israel, destroy the armies of the four Alliances which are massed at Armageddon, and then assume His rightful place as Ruler of the earth."
Jill introduces her studio guest: "I have invited Professor Heathrow, Professor of Biblical Ancient Civilization Studies at the University of Southern California, to explain what the Bible says is about to happen during this Grand Finale. Welcome back to the program. Professor Heathrow, according to the Book of Revelation, Armageddon is only days away. Tell our audience what to expect next."
Professor Heathrow: "I described the timing issue on your show over 3 years ago, so let us review.  The Bible tells us the Tribulation is seven years long consisting of two equal sections, each exactly 1260 days long.  Bible years do not match our current calendar years, since the ancients measured years by the moon, and a year was 360 days long, which was twelve complete moon cycles.  Of course, our solar years are 365 days plus one extra day every four years.  So 3 1/2 moon-years is 360 x 3.5 which is 1260 days.  But days are days, and the Bible says the Tribulation will last 2 x 1260 equals 2520 days.  That is 37 days short of seven solar years, since we had 2 leap years since the Vanishment.  Therefore in solar years the Tribulation will last a total of 6 years 10 months and 24 days.  That means the Second Advent of Jesus Christ is just 5 days away.  And Armageddon happens when the Lord returns."
Jill: "So Professor, we are just 5 days from Armageddon?"
Professor Heathrow: "Correct. Five days and no more. We will start with an overview of what leads up to Armageddon and the Second Advent, and then cover the supporting verses from the Bible in detail to understand why we know these things. Jesus Christ will return to earth when Satan's four human armies are amassed in Israel, forming a battle line from the north at Armageddon, going southeast along the Jordan River Valley into southern Jordan, and extending back over to Jerusalem and into southern Israel. These armies are intending to destroy each other, and also the Jewish believers in Israel. At the northernmost part of the battle line in north Israel is Armageddon (aka the Plain of Megiddo, Esdraelon, or Valley of Jezreel) where the bulk of the four armies will be located."
"In southern Israel the Jewish believers are fighting the Antichrist's forces. Some Israeli Resistance troops in Jerusalem will be cut off and in danger of being annihilated, but the Lord will cover the Antichrist forces with supernatural darkness for the last hours prior to the Second Advent, preventing the destruction of the Jewish believers fighting against him. This will be the second time this darkness is used by the Lord to create an impenetrable darkness where artificial lights will be of no use, so the unbeliever armies and their sophisticated weapons of war, many of which rely on using the electromagnetic spectrum such as fiber optics, microwave, GPS and other technologies, will be immobilized by it. Then the whole world will be darkened during the last day, and while it is still dark, without warning there will be blinding light and angelic trumpets, and the Lord returns to deliver His people who are in great jeopardy."
"Jesus Christ first comes down to southern Israel (Judah) to defend the Jewish believers there, since they are in the most danger once the supernatural darkness is lifted by the Second Advent. Then He will go to Jerusalem and literally stand on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem and split it in half with an earthquake, allowing the Jewish remnant of believers fighting in Jerusalem to escape using the newly formed valley through the middle of the Mount of Olives. As the Jewish believers are empowered by the Lord, they begin to wipe out the unbeliever armies in southern Israel, then these Jewish fighters come to the aid of those fighting in Jerusalem. The Lord also brings panic and confusion on the enemy forces, causing them to turn on each other. Once southern Israel and Jerusalem are secure, the Lord proceeds to work His way up from the south, wiping out the unbeliever armies amassed all along the Jordan border with Israel where the Jewish believers who had fled at the Midpoint of the Tribulation are in hiding.  He then goes up along the Jordan River, wiping out the forces massed along it. Finally, the Lord attacks the unbeliever armies of the four kings at Armageddon where they have gathered to fight each other."
"Upon seeing the Lord, these four armies stop fighting each other and turn instead to fight against Him. At that point they are annihilated by a single word from the mouth of Jesus Christ, the world war ends, and all Tribulation Bowl and Trumpet Judgments are complete. All elect angels and resurrected believers from Heaven ride along with Him, but do not participate in the destruction. The Lord needs no help, although He allows the Jewish believers fighting in and around Jerusalem to have their victory over the unbeliever armies which had sacked Jerusalem. The end of the world war sets the stage for Jesus Christ to claim His rightful position as ruler of the earth from Satan who usurped the position at the fall of Adam in the Garden of Eden.
Jill: "What are some of the supporting Bible verses for what you just described will happen?"
Professor Heathrow continues: "Daniel 11 reveals some of the maneuvering of the four Tribulation armies of the North, South, East, and West, which will all converge on the Middle East, and Israel in particular, to attempt to kill the Jews and fight the Lord as He returns:
Daniel 11:40 “At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him [the King of the West – Antichrist] in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him [the Antichrist] with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He [the Antichrist is now every “he”, “him” and “his” in these verses] will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood. 41 He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon [where Jews are in supernatural hiding] will be delivered from his hand. 42  He will extend his power over many countries... 44  But reports from the east and the north will alarm him [the other three Alliance armies advancing toward Israel], and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many. 45 He will pitch his royal tents between the seas and the beautiful holy mountain [Jerusalem]. Yet he [the Antichrist] will come to his end, and no one will help him.”
"Then the Book of Joel describes the return of the Lord and the destruction of the four armies massed at Armageddon:"
Joel 3:11 “Come quickly, all you nations from every side, and assemble there. Bring down your warriors, LORD! 12 “Let the nations be roused; let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat [near Jerusalem], for there I will sit to judge all the nations on every side. 13 Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, trample the grapes, for the winepress is full and the vats overflow—so great is their wickedness!” 14 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD [Second Advent] is near in the valley of decision. 15 The sun and moon will be darkened, and the stars no longer shine [on the day of the Second Advent].
Professor Heathrow continues: "As we have seen, just prior to the Second Advent there will be supernatural darkness over the entire earth. This worldwide darkness follows the darkness covering only the Antichrist's empire and military forces caused by the 5th Bowl Judgment."
Jill interjects to Professor Heathrow: "Professor, what does the Book of Revelation say specifically about the return of the Lord and Armageddon?"
Professor Heathrow: "Some of the important verses are as follows:"
Revelation 19:11 “I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war.”
"During the Second Advent of Christ, Jesus Christ returns as a Warrior-King to deliver His people, eliminate the degeneracy on the earth, further avenge the killing of believers during the Tribulation, and establish His Millennial Kingdom on earth. As Jesus said in the Book of Matthew, everyone on earth will see His coming:"
“For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 28  Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.  29  Immediately after the distress of those days “‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’ 30  Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven [after total darkness]. And then all the peoples [unbelievers] of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. 31  And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect [dead Old Testament and Tribulation believers resurrected] from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.”
"Zechariah 14 covers the battle in and around Jerusalem which is ongoing when the Lord returns.  The Israeli Resistance will be fighting the forces of the Antichrist.  The battle will not be going well for the Resistance fighters, and the Lord will turn that around:"
"Zechariah says: "Then the LORD will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights on a day of battle. 4  On that day [Second Advent] his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south. 5 You [believer Jews in Jerusalem] will flee by my mountain valley [pathway newly formed by the earthquake], for it will extend to Azel [outside Jerusalem city limits]. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come [Second Advent], and all the holy ones with him [all believers in resurrection bodies, and all elect angels]. 6 On that day there will be neither sunlight nor cold, frosty darkness. 7  It will be a unique day—a day known only to the LORD—with no distinction between day and night [supernatural darkness]. When evening comes, there will be light [at the return of Christ]. 	12
This is the plague with which the LORD will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. 13 On that day [Second Advent] people will be stricken by the LORD with great panic. They will seize each other by the hand and attack one another. 14 Judah [Jewish believers from outside Jerusalem] too will fight at Jerusalem.”
Professor Heathrow continues: "Zechariah prophesied about the Second Advent and how the very first act of the Lord will be to help the Jews fighting in southern Israel (Judah), followed by deliverance of the Jewish believers trapped in Jerusalem. As a result these Jews will become empowered to defeat the attacking army of the Antichrist during the time of the Second Advent:"
“Then the LORD will appear over them; his arrow will flash like lightning. The Sovereign LORD will sound the trumpet; he will march in the storms of the south, 15 and the LORD Almighty will shield them. They will destroy and overcome with slingstones. They will drink and roar as with wine; they will be full like a bowl used for sprinkling the corners of the altar. 16 The LORD their God will save his people on that day.”
"The Jewish believers in southern Israel will fight with extreme enthusiasm as the Lord shields them and also brings panic and confusion on the unbeliever armies. The Jewish forces are enabled by the Lord to accomplish incredible feats of daring, bravery, and skill as warriors. They will destroy the enemy outside Jerusalem, then will go do the same in Jerusalem. The Lord could do this Himself, but He allows the Jewish believers to have their own victory over their oppressors who have killed so many of their friends and compatriots.
Revenge belongs to the Lord, but He sometimes shares it for specific purposes. Zechariah continues:"
“The LORD, who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the human spirit within a person, declares: 2 “I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem. 3 On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves. 4  On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness,” declares the LORD. “I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations [supernatural darkness]. 5 Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the LORD Almighty is their God.’ 6  “On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume all the surrounding peoples right and left, but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place. 7 “The LORD will save the dwellings of Judah first [first act of the Second Advent is in southern Israel outside of Jerusalem], so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem’s inhabitants may not be greater than that of Judah [those Jewish believers in southern Israel but outside Jerusalem]. 8 On that day the LORD will shield those who live in Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD going before them [Jewish believers will be fierce warriors]. 9 On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem.”
"And finally Isaiah talks about Armageddon:"
Isaiah 34:1 “Come near, you nations, and listen; pay attention, you peoples! Let the earth  hear, and all that is in it, the world, and all that comes out of it! 2 The LORD is angry with all nations; his wrath is on all their armies. He will totally destroy them, he will give them over to slaughter. 3 Their slain will be thrown out, their dead bodies will stink; the mountains will be soaked with their blood. 4  All the stars in the sky will be dissolved and the heavens rolled up like a scroll [nuclear warfare among the four Kings' armies]; all the starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine, like shriveled figs from the fig tree. 5  My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; see, it descends in judgment on Edom [western Jordan], the people I have totally destroyed [where enemy armies are massed along the Jordan River Valley]...6 For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom [both located along the Jordan River Valley]...8 For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of retribution, to uphold Zion’s cause.”
Professor Heathrow:  "Isaiah goes on to say: “Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah [southeast of the Dead Sea in Jordan], with his garments stained crimson? [The Lord has annihilated the armies massed along the Jordan border with Israel] Who is this, robed in splendor, striding forward [to finish the task at Armageddon] in the greatness of his strength? “It is I [Jesus Christ at Second Advent], proclaiming victory, mighty to save.” 2 Why are your garments red, like those of one treading the winepress? 3 “I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath; their blood spattered my garments, and I stained all my clothing. 4  It was for me the day of vengeance; the year for me to redeem had come 	6 I trampled the nations in my anger; in my wrath I made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground.”
Professor Heathrow continues: "And finally from Joel again:"
Joel 3:16 The LORD will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem [during Second Advent]; the earth and the heavens will tremble. But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.”
"From these Old Testament passages we can piece together the path the Lord will take during the Second Advent.  There are probably at least 100 million unbelievers engaged in these battles when the Lord returns, and they will all be killed, starting with the Antichrist's forces in southern Israel (Judah) outside of Jerusalem, then those in and around Jerusalem, followed by the enemies of Israel massed along the Jordan border southeast of the Dead Sea (Bozrah), then finally the remainder at Armageddon.  The Lord accomplishes most of the slaughter of the unbeliever armies, but also empowers believer Jews to fight and defeat their enemies, especially in southern Israel (Judah) and around Jerusalem."
Jill: "So let me try to summarize, Professor. At the Second Advent Jesus Christ will engage in four separate battles, not just one battle at Armageddon in northern Israel. The four battles will be:
1)  Southern Israel, also called Judah: The Lord starts by delivering the Jewish believers fighting the Antichrist forces in southern Israel outside of Jerusalem. These Jews will be in immediate peril and must be delivered first.
2)  Then He goes to Jerusalem where He will stand on the Mount of Olives just east of Jerusalem and cause an earthquake, creating a valley through the Mount so that the Jewish believers trapped in Jerusalem will escape.
3)  After that, He goes to the border between Israel and Jordan along the Jordan River and destroys the Antichrist forces along that border and near Bozrah, Jordan -- also called Edom, Moab and Ammon -- where the Jewish believers who fled Israel at mid-Tribulation have been hiding.
4)  And finally Christ goes to northern Israel where the world's four Alliance armies are massed at Armageddon, and He destroys all remaining enemy forces of the Kings of the North, South, East, and West. So Armageddon is the Grand Finale."
Professor Heathrow: "Exactly right, Jill. Could not have stated it better myself."
Jill: "Thank you, Professor. We will be right back......" After a few seconds Jill realizes there are no longer any advertisements, and nothing to fill in the gaps. The news studio has devolved into just two people doing something because they want to. No one is getting paid to perform the work. There are no businesses supporting the news. There is no economy remaining, only the "cash market" where a few basic items are sold at very high prices.
Otherwise, everyone is just waiting, although most do not know what they are waiting for. But they wait anyway. LA has become an empty shell of its former self. Jill is surprised there is still electricity to power her show. She pulls out one of her last remaining bottles of water and takes a small sip. There are only a few remaining, and nowhere to buy more.
CHAPTER 34
THE TWO WITNESSES KILLED

Jill Steiner and Jack Ford have gone to a 24 hour format.  She takes short breaks and naps as she can, while Jack rolls video which comes in at a steady pace.  Her news is still number one in the world, but the world has a lot fewer people than it did a couple years ago.  She wonders how many are still watching.  It must be a large percentage of those remaining since video keeps coming in from all over the world.  It is far more than Jack can process.
Jill: "The world is within a few days of Armageddon. During these next several days, events will move very quickly, especially in Israel."
Producer Jack Ford tells Jill there is something happening in Jerusalem. He puts up live video from Jerusalem where Moses and Elijah are about to speak near the Temple.
Jill: "Let's look at the live video feed from Jerusalem shared by a viewer:"
Moses and Elijah are shown making their way to the Temple Square to address the crowd gathered there. Moses begins: "The end is near for the forces of evil. Our job here on earth -- our second time here -- is now finished. We will return to our home for now, and word of our deaths will be reported everywhere. This must happen. But we will return for a third time in a few days. Those of you who believe in the Lord will soon see this world changed into a paradise after the Lord returns and eliminates the forces of evil. For those who are not believers in the Lord, this is your final chance to believe in Him and accept the free gift of salvation provided through the Lord Jesus Christ. This is our final message."
After they finish, Jill reads from Revelation 11:
Revelation 11:7 “Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them. 8 Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city—which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt—where also their Lord was crucified. 9 For three and a half days some from every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial. 10 The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.”
As Moses and Elijah finish speaking, a dark shadowy figure looms large above them. Moses looks up and declares "Do what you must! Your doom is very near, and you cannot escape it." With that, Moses and Elijah fall dead on the Temple Square.
The scene is viewed live around the world, and Jill's coverage is the most watched. As the two fall, the close-in crowd made up mainly of believers, becomes silent. But after a few moments those farther back break out in cheers, celebrating the death of Moses and Elijah. World leaders are quick to join the celebration. President Antivon, who is traveling with the Western Alliance military forces headed toward northern Israel, stops to provide an interview about the event with a local reporter. Jill picks up the live video feed and airs it on her show:
President Antivon: "This is a great day for people of the earth. These two have been a source of much pain for people everywhere. Their bigoted views that there is only one God were outdated. Now they are dead and gone. Good! I declare this a day of celebration, and extra rations will be provided, along with extra water. Our people have been starved and are thirsty because these two held back the rain from falling. Crops failed, and after the other disasters happened the rain was the only source of drinking water. We are finally rid of these two. So let the celebration begin!"
The LANX coverage shows video feeds of large crowds gathering in several locations around the world, celebrating the death of Moses and Elijah. After showing the celebrations, Jill reads to the audience from her book regarding the death of Moses and Elijah:
"As the Second Advent nears and their witnessing is complete, God allows one of the senior demons who had come out of the Abyss (Abaddon) to kill them both. Their corpses will lay in the streets of spiritually bankrupt and degenerate Jerusalem – like Egypt and Sodom of old -- for 3 ½ days and no one will bury them.	Their deaths will be a cause for great celebration among the unbelieving populace, especially among the false religious leaders who hated them for opposing their idolatry. But their celebration will soon turn into shock, panic and intense fear.
Jill tells her audience there will soon be an earthquake in Jerusalem. Within the hour it happens. As the crowds in Jerusalem are shown celebrating in the streets of Jerusalem, an enormous earthquake hits the city. There is severe damage, and buildings fall everywhere. Many are killed and injured.
After airing the video showing widespread destruction in Jerusalem, Jill reads:
Revelation 11:13 “At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.”
Then Jill reads from her book:
"At the time the two witnesses are taken up into Heaven, Jerusalem is devastated by a large earthquake and 7000 die instantly... Now these Jewish believers begin to celebrate, and are the ones who “give glory to the God of heaven.” More about the earthquake issue later. Some unbelievers convert due to the event, but most do not. This is essentially the last chance they will have to change their minds about Christ and be saved."
Jill ends with "It is three days until Armageddon and the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. We will see Moses and Elijah again on that final day.”
CHAPTER 35
THE BATTLE IN ISRAEL

Israeli Resistance fighters under General Dayan are on the move.  The forces of the Antichrist are determined to eliminate the Israeli Resistance, and they have set out to destroy the remaining two groups under General Dayan and General Gurian.  The secret location of the Israeli Resistance near Bethlehem had been discovered, so they were forced to relocate.  They chose a new location west of Bethlehem, and just 15 miles southwest of Jerusalem.  During the troop movement a portion of the Israeli Resistance forces under General Gurian went northward toward Jerusalem for supplies, but were cut off from returning to the main group and were forced to head into enemy territory on the outskirts of southern Jerusalem, where they engaged the Western forces.  The fighting was not going well for these Israeli Resistance troops in Jerusalem, but General Dayan could not get help to them.  He had his own issues with Western troops on his heels trying to catch up with him as he headed westward to set up a new encampment, which at this point seemed unlikely to happen.  There seemed to be no direction they could go without engaging Western troops.  Both General Dayan's and General Gurian's Israeli Resistance troops were trapped.
The two groups of Israeli Resistance forces under the command of Generals Dayan and Gurian engaged the enemy as best they could. Mainly they tried to avoid head-on confrontations, and instead used short incursions to make small gains here and there. They fought the forces of the Antichrist bravely, but their prospects of getting out alive seemed slim, humanly, speaking. But they knew they would be delivered in just a few days.
Both Generals knew the Bible prophecies about the end of the Tribulation. Zechariah prophesied about the Second Advent and how the very first act of the Lord will be to help the Jews fighting in southern Israel outside Jerusalem, followed by deliverance of the Jewish believers trapped inside Jerusalem. As a result these Jewish Resistance fighters will become empowered to defeat the attacking army of the Antichrist during the time of the Second Advent. As Zechariah prophesied, Judah (southern Israel) will be besieged as well as Jerusalem. Then when all the nations of the earth are gathered against Israel "the Lord will return and strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness...I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations [supernatural darkness]." The Generals told their troops to watch for the supernatural darkness, which would blind the enemy forces but not the Israeli forces, and allow them to attack the enemy and overpower them while they are blinded.
The LORD will save those in southern Israel outside of Jerusalem first, then He will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem. The two Generals reassured their troops: "As Moses told the people of Israel when they were trapped against the Red Sea, and all seemed hopeless: "Stand still and watch the deliverance of the Lord!”
CHAPTER 36
THE SECOND ADVENT

In Jerusalem near the Temple the bodies of Moses and Elijah had been lying in the street for three days while many came to look and scoff and celebrate their death. The unbelieving world was glad to be rid of them. They constantly reminded them that their days on earth would be short, and then they would spend eternity in the Lake of Fire. World leaders saw the two as getting in their way. Their message was seen as no longer valid in a modern world.
The witnesses were despised, and the authorities would not let them be buried. They wanted the world to watch their bodies rot in the street where they had died.
Jill Steiner now remains in the studio 24 hours per day.  She does not want to miss a thing, so she sleeps in small segments at the studio.  She told her audience earlier this morning to watch the bodies of Moses and Elijah today, because they would see something spectacular.
And they did.
A viewer in Jerusalem who was an avid follower of Jill Steiner's news kept a live video feed going from just before sunrise. Of course, Jack Ford kept the video on screen full time, sometimes side by side with other video coming into the studio. In Jerusalem at sunrise, Moses and Elijah suddenly stood up. A few standing by cheered. They knew it was coming. But most were horrified to see the rotting corpses, which had been stinking from lying three days in the sun, alive and whole again. As the world watched Moses and Elijah, now alive again for a third time, the pair raised their hands toward the sky and departed upward in a cloud.
As the two were standing there, Jill read to her audience: "As it says in Revelation 11: “But after the three and a half days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them. 12 Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on.”
Jill continues: "Resuscitated once again, the two show the power of God to an evil world, then are taken up into Heaven as the world watched in disbelief and horror. That spectacular event is a signal that the seventh Trumpet is about to begin. They are resuscitated on the day the Lord returns. Today is that day, the Day of the Lord. The Second Advent of Christ."
Jill reads from her book, as she has done so often. It has never let her down:
"The Second Advent of Christ is the 3rd Woe and includes the seventh Trumpet and the seventh Bowl. The armies of the world will gather to attempt to destroy Israel and the Jews, and will end up facing each other at Armageddon, at which point the Lord returns. The Second Advent is not so much a single event as a series of events which occur as Jesus Christ returns and completes the task of cleansing the earth from evil in preparation for His rule during the Millennial Kingdom...At the Second Advent He returns to deliver the earth from Satan's rule and arrives as a Warrior-King, judging the guilty and avenging the death of those believers killed by these evil people, and destroys the armies attempting to slaughter Jewish believers in Jerusalem and throughout Israel. His warrior role is primarily aimed at the final defeat of Satan and his demons, but degenerate mankind will join Satan’s cause, making them also the objects of His vengeance."
Jill reviews the current status: "The Antichrist and his Western Alliance army has invaded Israel attempting to destroy it. God has also pulled the other three Alliance armies of the Kings of the North, South, and East into northern Israel to set up one final battle at Armageddon, and also to distract and frustrate the Antichrist's forces (King of the West) as they attempt to kill all remaining Jews in Israel. The Antichrist's armies are now split into four parts located in southern Israel, Jerusalem, the Israel/Jordan border, and the Jezreel Valley in northern Israel.
Jack Ford shows video from southern Israel where Western Alliance forces have been trying to wipe out the Israeli Resistance forces under Generals Dayan and Gurian, who are bravely fighting the Western Alliance forces. President Antivon has given his hardened troops orders to wipe out all Jewish fighters, and take no prisoners. The battle was not going well for the Israeli Resistance. It was at this hopeless point when the darkness came, and the video turned blank, but the audio remained.  Jack was confused for a moment, but then Jill explained to her audience:
"We are now seeing the second supernatural darkness supplied by the Lord to shield his people. It affects only the Western Alliance forces while the Israeli Resistance forces will be able to see clearly."
Back in southern Israel General Dayan recognized what was happening, and it was just as Zechariah had prophesied. His troops could see clearly, but the Western Alliance forces of the Antichrist were blinded by the darkness. He ordered his troops to attack. This was for Jerusalem. This was for the imprisonment of Jews captured and sent to concentration camps. This was for revenge.
The tide of the battle turned, as the blinded Western Alliance forces could not see or detect the Israeli Resistance troops as they engaged them. These were the hardened evil forces which had ransacked Jerusalem and taken their fellow Jews into captivity, sending them out of Israel into concentration camps.  The Israeli Resistance forces under the command of Generals Dayan and Gurian are fighting with great enthusiasm as the Lord shields them while the blinded Western Alliance troops mostly fight each other because the Lord brought panic and confusion on them. The Jewish forces are enabled by the Lord to accomplish incredible feats of daring, bravery, and skill as warriors. They will first finish the task of destroying the enemy outside Jerusalem, then will go do the same inside Jerusalem. The Lord could do this Himself, but He allows the Jewish believers to have their own victory over their oppressors who have killed so many of their friends and compatriots. Revenge belongs to the Lord, but He sometimes shares it for specific purposes.
It was as Zechariah had prophesied:
Zechariah 9:15 “And the LORD Almighty will shield them. They will destroy and overcome with slingstones. They will drink and roar as with wine; they will be full like a bowl used for sprinkling the corners of the altar. 16 The LORD their God will save his people on that day.”
Jack Ford then runs another video of satellite footage showing the four Alliance armies are in place in the Jezreel Valley of northern Israel. There does not seem to be much movement, as all sides seem to be waiting for something to happen.
Jill:  "The stage is set, as it says in Revelation 16.
“Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.”
"While we are waiting for that Grand Finale, let me provide an overview from my book The Future Times which has served us so well over the past seven years:"
"At the Second Advent, Jesus Christ will return to earth when Satan's four human armies are amassed in Israel, forming a battle line from the north at Armageddon, going southeast along the Jordan River Valley, and extending to Jerusalem and southern Israel. These armies are intending to destroy the Jewish believers in Israel, many of whom are trapped in their last remaining stronghold in a portion of Jerusalem. At the northernmost part of the battle line in north Israel is Armageddon (aka the Plain of Megiddo or Esdraelon; Valley of Jezreel) where the bulk of the four armies will be located. The Jewish believers fighting the Antichrist troops in Jerusalem are cut off and in danger of being annihilated, but the Lord covers the Antichrist forces with supernatural darkness for the last several days prior to the Second Advent, preventing the destruction of the Jewish believers fighting against him. This will be an impenetrable darkness where artificial lights will be of no use, so the unbeliever armies and their sophisticated weapons of war, many of which rely on using the electromagnetic spectrum such as fiber optics, microwave, GPS and other technologies, will be immobilized by it. Then the whole world will be darkened during the last day, and while it is still dark, without warning there will be blinding light and angelic trumpets, and the Lord returns to deliver His people who are in great jeopardy. Jesus Christ first comes down to southern Israel (Judah) to defend the Jewish believers there, since they are in the most danger once the supernatural darkness is lifted by the Second Advent. Then He will go to Jerusalem and literally stand on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem and split it in half with an earthquake, allowing the Jewish remnant of believers fighting in Jerusalem to escape using the newly formed valley through the middle of the Mount of Olives. As the Jewish believers are empowered by the Lord, they begin to wipe out the unbeliever armies in southern Israel, then these Jewish fighters come to the aid of those fighting in Jerusalem. The Lord also brings panic and confusion on the enemy forces, causing them to turn on each other. Once southern Israel and Jerusalem are secure, the Lord proceeds to work His way up from the south, wiping out the unbeliever armies amassed all along the Jordan border with Israel where the Jewish believers who had fled at the Midpoint of the Tribulation are in hiding. Finally, He attacks the unbeliever armies of the four kings at Armageddon where they have gathered to fight each other. Upon seeing the Lord, these four armies stop fighting each other and turn instead to fight against Him. At that point they are annihilated by a word from the mouth of Jesus Christ and the world war ends, and all Tribulation Bowl and Trumpet Judgments are complete. All elect angels and resurrected believers from Heaven ride along with Him, but do not participate in the destruction. The Lord needs no help, although He allows the Jewish believers fighting in and around Jerusalem to have their victory over the unbeliever armies which had sacked Jerusalem. The end of the world war sets the stage for Jesus Christ to claim His rightful position as ruler of the earth from Satan who usurped the position at the fall of Adam in the Garden of Eden."
Jill is reporting as the scene unfolds:
Jill: "The world's four great Alliances are gathered together for battle at a place called by many names.  It has been called the Valley of Jezreel, the Plains of Esdraelon, and the Valley of Megiddo.  It is otherwise known as the ancient site of Mount Megiddo, translated as "Armageddon."  It is an eye shaped valley 25 miles long and about 6 miles wide at the center. The pupil would be the city of Afula.  At the eyelash area is Nazareth, the boyhood home of Jesus Christ.
"Is it only a coincidence that the world has long viewed "Armageddon" as the ultimate battle leading to total destruction? I think not. The boy from Nazareth, who became the Lord of the Universe, is coming home."
Jill continues: "Friends, let me be very clear. If you are not a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, you are on the wrong side of history. The forces gathered together at Megiddo are about to be wiped out. All of them. In one instant. The Lord is coming back. He will destroy the forces gathered at Megiddo."
"The Bible says "every eye will see Him." We are very close to that moment. The "Great Tribulation" is about to end, and it will end with the slaughter of evil. If you are on their side, you will not be delivered. I do not have anything else to say to you. I have said what there is to say...so we now wait for the return of the Lord."
With that said, Jill looks at the video screen and waits. The screen shows the forces of the world milling around, seemingly waiting for someone to give an order. The world waits. No one does anything except to watch and wait. Most of the world's people are starving, thirsty, sleep-deprived, and have very painful red sores, now thoroughly infected from the endless scratching. There is no economy. There are no jobs. There is no recreation. But believers are doing well because of divine protection, although everyone suffers from the effects of the disasters and judgments. But those who took the Mark suffered just as unbelievers did.
While waiting, Jill Steiner wants her audience to know that for believers, the future is very bright:
"In summary of what the Millennium will be like, it is the Kingdom which Christ will rule for 1000 years, with His throne located in Jerusalem.  It will be a time of perfect environment on the earth.  All Jews will be regathered into a much larger nation of Israel.  Jerusalem will be raised up as a mountain higher than any other on earth.  We see that after the Tribulation the Lord will heal the earth since it will be in terrible shape.  The destruction which occurred will be repaired, and the earth will also be changed such as the flattening of mountains, few islands and so forth.  Satan and fallen angels will not be on the earth to try to influence man and world events.  Humans in resurrection bodies will be on the earth as rulers over the humans who are living out their natural lives.  Elect angels will also live on the earth.  Plant life will be restored and also tamed.  Animals will no longer be wild or eat each other.  The seas and sea life will be restored and will thrive.  The sun and moon, afflicted during the Tribulation, will be made whole again.  Barren land and deserts will bloom.  The earth will be very friendly to mankind and will easily provide much bounty."
Producer Jack Ford tells the staff to keep the live video feed from Jezreel on screen. An hour passes, and then another. The screen shows the forces continuing to mill around. It is now almost sunset in the Jezreel Valley.
Suddenly a bright flash of light occurs in the atmosphere circling the entire earth. It is seen around the world. In the atmosphere above Israel there is much activity, looking like an army of clouds moving quickly from place to place, first to southern Israel, then far south Israel, and then above the Jordan River. At that point the army of clouds moves up along the Jordan River toward northern Israel.
Jill reads from her book:
Isaiah 63:1 “Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah [southeast of the Dead Sea in Jordan], with his garments stained crimson? [The Lord has annihilated the armies massed along the Jordan border with Israel] Who is this, robed in splendor, striding forward [to finish the task at Armageddon] in the greatness of his strength? “It is I [Jesus Christ at Second Advent], proclaiming victory, mighty to save.” 2 Why are your garments red, like those of one treading the winepress? 3  “I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath; their blood spattered my garments, and I stained all my clothing. 4  It was for me the day of vengeance; the year for me to redeem had come 	6 I trampled the nations in my anger; in my wrath I made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground.”
Joel 3:16 "The LORD will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem [during Second Advent]; the earth and the heavens will tremble. But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.”
These Old Testament passages show the path the Lord will take during the Second Advent, starting with the Antichrist's forces in southern Israel (Judah) outside of Jerusalem, then those in and around Jerusalem, followed by the enemies of Israel massed along the Jordan border southeast of the Dead Sea (Bozrah), then finally the remainder at Armageddon and anywhere else in Israel.
The armies of Heaven are the "clouds" which can be seen above Israel. It includes all elect angels plus those believers who were taken up at the Rapture nearly seven years ago. Those taken up in the Vanishment have returned. The returning believers are in their final status as eternally sanctified in resurrection bodies and each one is more powerful than any angel ever was, including Satan, yet they do no fighting. Only Jesus Christ has earned the right to be the Judge and to execute these intense judgments.
Revelation 19:15 “Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. “He will rule them with an iron scepter.”  He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. 16  On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.”
Isaiah 34:1 “Come near, you nations, and listen; pay attention, you peoples! Let the earth  hear, and all that is in it, the world, and all that comes out of it! 2 The LORD is angry with all nations; his wrath is on all their armies. He will totally destroy them, he will give them over to slaughter. 3 Their slain will be thrown out, their dead bodies will stink; the mountains will be soaked with their blood. 4  All the stars in the sky will be dissolved and the heavens rolled up like a scroll [nuclear warfare among the four Kings' armies]; all the starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine, like shriveled figs from the fig tree. 5  My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; see, it descends in judgment on Edom [western Jordan], the people I have totally destroyed [where enemy armies are massed along the Jordan River Valley]. 6 The sword of the LORD is bathed in blood, it is covered with fat—the blood of lambs and goats, fat from the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom [both located along the Jordan River Valley]. 7  And the wild oxen will fall with them, the bull calves and the great bulls. Their land will be drenched with blood, and the dust will be soaked with fat. 8 For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of retribution, to uphold Zion’s cause.”
The Israeli Resistance fighters under General Dayan have completely defeated the Western Alliance forces of the Antichrist in southern Judah, and enter Jerusalem to help General Gurian's forces trapped inside the city. They merge their forces just as a great earthquake occurs, splitting the Mount of Olives and creating a new valley through which the Israeli Resistance forces escape out of Jerusalem toward the east.
General Dayan looks back through the newly formed valley to see the remaining Western Alliance forces enter the other end of the valley, and coming toward them. Once the forces are all inside the valley, the walls of earth from the Mount of Olives fall in on them and they are killed. Every last one of them.
The two Generals count heads as they make their final escape out of the newly formed valley. Not one has been killed or even wounded in all the fighting over the past 24 hours.  The troops look skyward to see the army of clouds proceeding northward.
General Dayan stops his troops and tells them:  "Today we have been given a great victory by the Lord.  It is He who delivered us in southern Israel today, and it was He who split the Mount of Olives for our escape.  It was He who covered the enemy troops with earth as He had covered the Egyptian army with the Red Sea during the time of Moses.  He then quoted from Psalm 21 "Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies; your right hand will seize your foes.
When you appear for battle, you will burn them up as in a blazing furnace. The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath, and his fire will consume them."
Jill continues reading from her book and quoting from the Bible to fill the time between events.
Matt 24:27 “For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man... 29  Immediately after the distress of those days “‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’ 30  Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven [after total darkness]. And then all the peoples [unbelievers] of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. 31  And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect [dead Old Testament and Tribulation believers resurrected] from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.”
Revelation 16:17 “The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, “It is done!” 18 Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since mankind has been on earth, so tremendous was the quake. 19 The great city [Jerusalem] split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed... 20  Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found. 21  From the sky huge hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds, fell on people. And they cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because the plague was so terrible.”
"After the 7th Bowl is released, the phrase “It is done!” is stated by the Lord from the throne room in Heaven. This is the final Bowl Judgment before the Second Advent of Christ.
Tremendous earthquakes, huge hail, and devastating natural disasters torment the remaining unbelievers around the world.  The huge hailstones kill many unbelievers, destroy their homes and other structures, and cause widespread panic.  Again, believers are spared from these judgments unless they take the Mark of the Beast.  Jerusalem is split into three parts by an earthquake, allowing the Jewish believers in the city to flee to safety as they are fighting the armies of the Antichrist who is attacking Jerusalem (Zechariah 14:4-5).  “No earthquake like it has ever occurred since mankind has been on earth” describes its intensity.  Many other major cities also collapse during the massive earthquakes.  Islands cease to exist from all the tsunamis and explosive volcanoes set loose by those earthquakes.  Mountains are leveled worldwide.  All of this sets up changes in the landscape for the Millennium, when the earth  will be leveled as mountains fill in the valleys setting the
 




Vanishment & Tribulation

About the cover:
The cover depicts the Resurrection (Rapture) of the Church when all believers who are alive will be taken up into the atmosphere by the Lord Jesus Christ, given eternal bodies, and then taken into Heaven. Their human bodies on earth will disappear when this happens as the Bible says:
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.  And so we will be with the Lord forever." (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17)
"We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed -- in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality."  (1 Corinthians 15:50)

PREFACE

This novel is closely based on Bible prophesies about the Resurrection or "Rapture" of the Church and the seven year Tribulation which follows. In that sense this is not a work of fiction. However, fictional characters and situations are intertwined with the actual order of prophesied Biblical events to make those events come alive and be more understandable to the Reader. The primary purpose is to inform about what the Bible says, but it is also meant to be interesting and entertaining, because the Bible is not boring.
When the Rapture of the Church happens it will be generally seen as an unexplained "Vanishment" by unbelievers of that time as they attempt to explain it away. With all believers removed from the earth, the remaining restraints on evil will be greatly diminished, and the world will be ready to accept extreme evil in ways not otherwise possible. But many who are left behind will be awakened by the Rapture and will believe in Jesus Christ as their Savior. These new believers will see it for what it really is, a wake-up call. Jews will especially be awakened to the reality that they missed their prophesied Messiah. A period of Tribulation will then engulf the world for 7 years and the forces of evil personified by the Antichrist will severely persecute the new believers. Many will be killed -- martyred in great numbers because of their faith. The thin veil of civilization will be ripped apart from top to bottom as the basest instincts of sinful mankind are unleashed. This seven year period of Tribulation will be the most evil of all human history, and as a result God will allow judgments and disasters of types and magnitudes never before seen on the earth.
The Tribulation will be a time of evil lawless dictators who destroy individual freedoms and trample the rights of anyone they do not agree with, especially the new believers.  The forces of evil will have their seven year revelry, but God will avenge the persecution of His believers. Evil will have its last stand, but Truth and Justice will triumph as the Lord returns at the end of the Tribulation to destroy the forces of evil and institute His 1000 year Millennial reign under perfect environment on this same earth, which only He can put in place.
But first, the Vanishment awakens a world in slumber.	and triggers the seven year countdown to Armageddon.
CHAPTER 1
THE VANISHMENT

Sometime in the future.....
Veteran SkyCopter News pilot Tommy Jackson slowly turns his helicopter southward as he heads back toward the Los Angeles airport.  No sudden turns, since in the seat beside him is newly-minted reporter Sean Thompson, on his first helicopter reporting trip.  Tommy has cleaned up after newbie reporters before, so he has learned that lesson well.  After a quick run northward over the San Gabriel mountain range to obtain aerial video for an upcoming report on the Angeles National Forest, the SkyCopter News crew is heading back to LAX airport to refuel and get their afternoon assignment.  As they pass over the last of the mountain peaks, the LA basin scene comes into full view, and today they can actually see all the way to the ocean.  Pilot Tommy Jackson has done this many times, and always looks forward to the moment he crests the last peaks of the mountain range and sees the spectacular LA basin  view.  As he does, this time the scene is disturbing.  Wait -- why all the black smoke, and in so many locations?  It was just normal LA traffic when the crew left the airport only an hour ago. On closer inspection they see the nearest freeway, the I-210, is shut down in both directions, with multiple accidents, some vehicles burning.  As they gaze further into the LA basin and head toward downtown, the scene becomes clearer as one of complete chaos.  Tommy turns  on the police scanner which had been turned off while filming, and it is erupting with chaotic calls for assistance.  Tommy pushes the helicopter to maximum speed while reporter Sean Thompson reaches to turn on his outboard cameras, and then relays an urgent message to the LANX News producer:  "This is SkyCopter 1 -- quick, you need to air this live video right now!"
In the studio LANX News producer Jack Ford takes one look at the footage coming in from SkyCopter 1 and shouts into the earpiece of on-air news anchor Jill Steiner, who is doing a live interview with a local politician.  "Jill, cut off the interview -- urgent breaking news.  Cover the SkyCopter footage I am putting up now.  Do it right now."  Jill stops talking in mid-sentence as footage appears on the screen behind her.  She gasps as she struggles to orient to what it shows.  The live helicopter video pans across the Los Angeles basin showing traffic snarled, many overturned cars, freeways clogged, black smoke rising from multiple areas, police cars and ambulances everywhere.  There is mass chaos and city highways are at a virtual stand– still. The producer tells Jill to let the SkyCopter News reporter cover the story.  She shakes her head in disbelief and then her veteran anchor skills kick in. She instinctively goes into her breaking news routine.
LANX anchor Jill Steiner: "We have breaking news, and are going straight to our SkyCopter Reporter over the I-5 freeway north of downtown....Sean, the video is frightening...what is going on?"
SkyCopter Reporter Sean Thompson's voice comes on-air as he struggles to decide what to cover first: "Jill, we have an enormous mess down there. The freeways are absolutely shut down. Accidents are everywhere, and many vehicles are burning. Hundreds of accidents, maybe over a thousand, we just don't know. Multiple ambulances are moving as best they can, and if they can, but it won't be enough. The police and EMS crews report they are overwhelmed and a number of their own vehicles have crashed. I see at least one gasoline tanker on fire on I-5 just north of downtown. There are reports of two Metro Rail train accidents. Police are reporting that many of the accidents were caused when vehicles just seemed to crash without any reason, and all over the city. And another odd thing, initial reports state there are very few survivors of all the freeway crashes."
Jill to SkyCopter 1: "What happened, Sean?  That many vehicles don't just...um...crash, for...for no good reason..." Jill stumbles as she tries to find the right words while still watching the live video feed.  "What else do you see?  And what do you mean, very few survivors?"
SkyCopter News Reporter: "Jill, it's just a mess, and I can't tell what is actually going on down there." Sean struggles to catch his breath...and also think of something useful to say. "Let me just say that we need eyes on the ground to tell both of us. We will try to get lower for a better view, but air traffic control is overwhelmed, and there is thick black smoke coming from the airport area. We are heading that way next to check it out."
"Give me just a moment" Jill says into the camera as she listens to her producer through her earpiece..."We are getting reports that this is happening all over the U.S. Something very strange is going on here and elsewhere....so now we will...hold on a moment..." Jill says as she presses on her earpiece "...and now my producer is telling me this may even be a worldwide event. What the hell is going on? OK, we are cutting over to our Washington D.C. news affiliate DCNX as they report on this breaking news..."
DCNX News feed starts while their reporter is in mid-sentence: "...and so it seems there are mass casualty events occurring all over the U.S. But they are spread out, not localized as in a terrorist attack. Additionally, reports out of several European countries show it is a global event, but exactly what has happened, no one seems to know. The main issues reported so far have been mass vehicle accidents, including numerous car and commercial truck accidents, several airplane crashes, freight train derailments, and a Washington Metro train accident in the underground near downtown. Emergency services and first responders are overwhelmed and cannot handle the multiple incidents. It is mass chaos out there. In related news, several well-known people seem to be missing. Requests for a statement from the White House have so far gone unanswered. There seems to be an unusual amount of confusion over there and staffers refuse to say anything. Whatever this is, whether some new form of diffused terrorism or mass technological glitches or whatever else, I can only say that the scale of this disastrous event has never before been seen.  Back to you in the studio.	"
As the DCNX report ends, LANX anchor Jill Steiner comes back on-air: "As we have just seen, this is not a local LA event. And whatever it is, it is very big and highly unusual. We going to a break to try to sort this out as best we can, and will be right back "
The Producer keeps the SkyCopter News live feed going, with the SkyCopter News crew now over south LA as Jill goes off air. Jill and her news staff discuss the events and the limited information available. A couple of her staff members who were seen just before the breaking news are now missing from the studio. Jill looks at their boss and tells him "Either find them or fire them. This is no time to be running off without permission!"
News Producer Jack Ford relays to Jill that police radio scanner reports indicate the cars that crashed had no drivers. Jill tells her news staff "get an automated driver-less car expert on the line and tell us if there has been some type of systemic software malfunction. And get a terrorism expert in here ASAP for me to interview. Also check for experts on any other types of technological glitches that might explain some of this. Just get me some people to interview. Now!!!"
Several news staff members report cell phone coverage problems as Jill is forced to go back on air without much information. She wings it and stalls for time. All she can do is cover what she sees on the SkyCopter News video, which shows a scene of freeways at a standstill, multiple smoking accident scenes, emergency vehicles which cannot move through the stalled traffic jams, and thick black smoke coming from the airport which has been confirmed as an inbound airplane crash just short of the runway on the beach along the ocean.
As Jill talks on-air about the live video feed from SkyCopter News she gets new inputs from her Producer, then tells the audience: "We now have reports that many of the cars were NOT the driver-less models.  Also, many of the cars which crashed did not have a driver at the crash site.  What does that even mean?  Going now to our on-scene reporter Don who is near downtown and stuck on the I-10 freeway.  Don – what can you tell us?"
Don:  "Jill, I am not able to move my car out here since the I-10 is a parking lot.  But I ventured out on foot and have seen several crash scenes where there was no one in the car at all, and no one near them.  Driver-less or driver-controlled is not the issue here.  Many of these cars simply had no one in them at all when they crashed."
Jill: "I'm not sure I understand what you mean the cars had no one in them. You mean the people were thrown clear?"
Don: "No, no, no...Jill, there was no one anywhere near the accident scenes. Not in them, not around them, not thrown from them. There were no drivers found. Just clothing in the driver's seat, and shoes on the floor. Beyond that I have no explanation.  Some had passengers who survived but they report their driver just vanished...they were there in the car one moment, and then gone the next. Drivers disappeared, and then the cars crashed, or at least that is what I have heard from multiple crash sites I have personally seen. Very odd, but I am just reporting what I have heard and seen out here."
