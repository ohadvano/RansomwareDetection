Sam scoffs. “And here I thought I was adopted.”
Sam takes an apple from the fruit bowl that sits on the end of the table.
“Oh honey, sorry to disappoint you.”
Sally kisses the top of Sam's head and winks at me. “You girls have a good day at school.”
She waves and leaves the room.
When the house door closes I smirk towards Sam. “You wish you were adopted?”
“You would be too if you heard what goes on in this house.” Sam looks in the microwave and looks at herself through the reflection. “They're at it all the time.”
I may have thrown up a little in my mouth hearing about Sam's parents' love life. I guess with how close we are as best friends it's nice to know that she feels comfortable sharing things with me, but sharing things about her parents might just be a little bit too personal. “That's a little too much information, Sam.”
Sam turns around. “I bet sex with Ryder was on your mind last night.”
