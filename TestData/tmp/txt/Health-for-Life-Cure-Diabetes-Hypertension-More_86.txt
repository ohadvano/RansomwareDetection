NUTRIENTS

Foods provide us with fats, carbohydrates, proteins, fiber, essential minerals and vitamins, enzymes, antioxidants and so many other nutrients that science is still discovering. Fruits and vegetables provide the greatest benefit to our bodies and the highest concentration of healthy nutrients. The fresher the food, the better.

Everyone doesnâ€™t need to become a vegetarian. I have no plans to completely give up fish, chicken, turkey or beef. I have no plans to totally eliminate eggs or milk products from my diet. These foods are good sources of some nutrients that are hard to find in abundance in plant foods, especially calcium. I like them. Iâ€™ve grown up eating them. I think they are provided by God, though I think we place too much of an emphasis on them in our diets. I am advocating a diet rich in plant foods â€“ fruits and vegetables in abundance. This entire book is about what I did to reverse the diseases in my life and the background information of why I did what I did. Nutrition is a part of that.

Four Essential Minerals

Calcium

â€¢Recommended: 1200-1500 mg daily for ages 11-24 and 1000 mg daily for ages 25 and older

â€¢Keeps bones strong and dense.

â€¢Aids in fat loss and maintaining proper weight

â€¢Helps regulate the heart beat

â€¢Helps metabolize iron

â€¢Alleviates insomnia

â€¢Regulates cell permeability

â€¢Critical to pH balance

â€¢Blood clotting and fat digestion depend on calcium

â€¢Nicotine, Cola, Alcohol, Caffeine, Refined Sugars, too much salt and eating excessive calories can deplete calcium levels.

â€¢Sugar upsets calcium metabolism â€“ so donâ€™t buy calcium supplements sold as candy, such as caramel or chocolate flavors

â€¢Excellent supplement forms are calcium citrate, calcium chelate and calcium gluconate.

â€¢Homogenized and Pasteurized milk is NOT a good source of digestible, absorbable calcium.

â€¢Food Sources: nuts (almonds), seaweeds, kelp, seeds (sesame seeds), tofu, broccoli, fruits, turnip greens, collard greens, dark green leafy vegetables and figs

Note: I did supplement calcium as I was not getting enough from my diet even though I had cut out all consumption of calcium depleting foods. I did not eat any animal or dairy products the first 30 days during my â€˜cleansing cycleâ€™. I took 600 mg calcium with 100 IU

Vitamin D. I now supplement my diet with 1 teaspoon of liquid angstrom calcium daily.

14

Sodium

â€¢Recommended: 2400 mg per day â€“ about 1 teaspoon

â€¢Permeates the space between cells and with potassium on the inside of cells regulates cell permeability, allowing for free passage of nutrients and waste

â€¢Bathes cells in a â€˜salty oceanâ€™

â€¢Is important to the healthy functioning and balance of the fluids in blood and lymph

â€¢Critical to pH balance

â€¢Necessary to the production of hydrochloric acid used in the stomach for digestion.

â€¢Required for proper nerve functioning and muscle contraction

â€¢If you have salt softened water at home you absorb calcium while bathing or showering, brushing your teeth, drinking tap water, and even washing clothes

â€¢During the refining of table salt (NaCl), natural sea salt or rock salt is stripped of more than 60 trace minerals and essential macro-nutrients. It is also heated at high temperatures that the chemical structure of salt changes. It is chemically cleaned and bleached and treated with anti-caking agents that prevent salt from mixing with water in the salt container. The anticaking agents perform the same function in the human body so that refined salt does not dissolve and combine with the water and fluids present in our system - it builds up in the body and leaves deposits in organs and tissue, causing severe health problems. To make matters worse, the anti-caking agents are made with aluminum, with the bad taste of the aluminum being covered by refined sugar.

â€¢If you need to use salt (sodium) with your meal, use unrefined sea salt or rock salt that contain natural nutrients used by the body much more effectively than refined table salt.
