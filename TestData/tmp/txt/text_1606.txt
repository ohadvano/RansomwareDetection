“What answers could you possibly want from me?” He glares intensely at both of us.
“Well first, how about you tell us asshole	”
I stop Ryder. “Ryder, please.” I give him a look to indicate that I'll do the talking. I can't risk him pissing off Max before we get any answers.
I clear my throat and begin my interrogation. “Do you remember that day, out by the football field when I saw you on crutches?”
“Of course I remember. It's kinda hard to forget being in a fight that happened on my first day of school.” He stares at Ryder.
Ryder's posture goes rigid as he stares directly back at Max. “What the fuck are you looking at?”
Yeah, maybe bringing Ryder was a bad idea.
Max wheezes. “Who do you think I'm looking at? I'm looking at you asshole considering you're the one who's beaten the crap out of me twice already!”
Ryder pushes himself off the couch, grabs Max by the collar of his shirt and slams him against the wall.
