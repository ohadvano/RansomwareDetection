Within little over half an hour they were able to find the street that ran from the heart of the town and into the forest. It also bore a small police port, were a few officers were stationed as lookout for potential smugglers and monsters, even incorporating a tower for an enhanced point of view.
Kiran and Aparna slowed their approach as an officer came to meet them. Kiran noticed his eyes paid more attention to Aparna, but he wasn’t surprised.
“Good afternoon children,” said the officer. “Where are you both headed?”
“Sir,” said Kiran, and the man switched his lustful gaze from Aparna to an annoyed one when he saw Kiran. “My name is Kiran Kehomba. I’m a sorcerer in training. I’ve come from my town to try and find popobawa parts for my spell. My friend her is accompanying me.”
“My name is Aparna,” she said. “I’m also a sorceress. We’re both trying to find resources to enter the Witching Tournament. I have a permit to enter this country and participate if you’d like to see.”
“Sure,” said the officer, “let me have them.”
Kiran and Aparna took out their IDs, and the officer gave Kiran’s a quick glance and handed it back to him. However, he carefully ran his fingers over Aparna’s hand as he took hers. She frowned and wiped her hands in her clothes, but the officer merely cackled and looked at her identification. “Aparna Borasing. Gabanyese, eh?”
“Yes,” she said. 
“Are we allowed to venture into the forest, sir?” said Kiran.
“…We don’t recommend it,” the man said thoughtfully. “If you do enter the forest however, you’ll have to sign a contract with the authorities giving your consent to be the ones solely responsible for your own wellbeing.”
“Sure,” said Kiran. “We’ll sign once we’re coming back. Come on Aparna.”
The young woman snatched her ID from the officer and followed Kiran back into town. They decided to take a walk along one of the factories to explore how far the advancements in technology in the country had gone. 
The facility was surrounded by a large fence of wooden posts, and through the large open door, the two could see trolleys and small carts carrying hunks of metal to and from the back.
Kiran looked up at the sign which read “Okoyo’s Engine Repair Service”. “Do you think they made a spell that can combine magic and machines?” said Kiran.
“Not to my knowledge,” said Aparna. “I don’t think that would even be allowed in the tournament either.”
“Would’ve been cool though,” Kiran said. “I know you have knights who are good at using gadgets.”
“Gadgets malfunction, spells don’t,” Aparna snapped. “Let’s go already. I still need to get the tingle of that policeman off me.”
Kiran shrugged and continued with Aparna back to the inn. While Kiran studied his book of spells once more, Aparna was just about finished with her knew spell, having gathered the ingredients to mix with the zebra semen and turn into an orb. She had a large bracelet with three sockets, one of which she fitted the orb into. Aparna channeled her spirit energy into the stone and locked the bracelet around her foot.
“Okay, all done,” said Aparna.
Kiran closed the book and sat up. “Okay. Let’s go see what Gatril’s up to.”
The two took his quacycle and rode out of the town. On the outskirts they made their way to the set of trees Gatril had indicated to them, only to find a giant, round mass of branches bent and woven into a nest.
“What in the world is that?” said Aparna.
“Don’t worry,” said Kiran as he parked his vehicle outside from the structure. “I think she just made a house.”
They got off and walked towards the nest, though Aparna kept a cautious distance behind Kiran. The boy turned on a new lantern he bought and carefully brought its light close to the entrance of the nest. “Gatril…?”
“What?” The voice came from behind them, and both humans spun around hysterically to see Gatril falling from the tree.
“G-Gatril!” Kiran said. “Don’t scare us like that!”
“That wasn’t nice, dragon,” said Aparna, her hand on the grip of her gun. “I could’ve shot you.”
“If you did, I would’ve bitten your head off.” And Gatril smiled, displaying her formidable teeth.
Kiran quickly went between them and said, “Hey, you two knock it off. We just came here to see how you are Gatril.”
“Check this out Kiran,” said Gatril. She turned away from everyone, inhaled briefly, and exhaled from her throat a stream of cloudy, green substance in the air. Kiran and Aparna got a whiff of it and immediately felt their heads going fuzzy and their knees buckling.
“Gyaaah!” Kiran covered his nose and hurried out of the mist. He fell on his knees. “G-Gatril, what is this stuff?”
Aparna fell on her bottom, wrapping her mouth and nose with her cloak. 
Gatril was all smiles despite the unhealthy predicament of her comrades. “You guys like it? It’s a special plant I ate. Bosdrakes have the ability to regurgitate specific chemicals in the food we eat.”
As the green fog disappeared, Kiran and Aparna rose to their feet, taking deep breaths so their lungs could recover. 
“You could’ve at least given us a warning,” said Aparna.
