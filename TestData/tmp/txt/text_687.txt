“Oh. Then it's a good thing you had it.”
I place two teaspoons of sugar in each mug, grab two tea- bags, pour the hot water and milk into the mugs, throw away the tea-bag and stir the tea. I grab the two mugs and bring them over to the table.
“Look, he came here tonight to save you which obviously means he cares. The first thing he asked when he picked up the phone was if you were okay, and he didn't have to bother coming here tonight but he did. For you.”
Sam takes a sip of her tea.
I find myself not having anything to say to that, I just grab my mug of tea and take a sip.
“You can stay here tonight if you want.”
I place my mug back on the table and sigh. “You won't mind? I haven't been the best company tonight.”
Sam looks at me with shock. “Alice, you went through hell tonight and it's not your fault. Blame the wolf that bit you.”
“I don't wanna be like this forever, Sam. What if there's a cure out there somewhere?”
