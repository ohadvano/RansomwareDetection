Kellan clears his throat. “A while back, Ryder and his family were camping out in the woods. Ryder and his parents changed frequently into wolves, but his sister fought every change because she feared that she'd lose control. Doing so made her weak. The night was a full moon, and Ryder and his parents knew how to control the change, but his sister was wondering around the woods, probably gathering more wood for the fire, but she didn't come back for a while and Ryder couldn't understand where she'd gone. It turned out that she did turn, but she barely managed it on her own.” Kellan clears his throat again. “She ran for miles and ended up by the creak. Anna was found ripped to shreds by the river. They were too late.”
Ryder and Anna were brother and sister!?
“Anna..?” I gasp, “Your Anna?”
“Anna thought she was adopted because she looked nothing like Ryder, but she meant everything to the two of us.”
“Kellan, I'm so sorry.”
“You'd never guess that they were related so no one asked about it. That's why Ryder's just trying to make people understand that changing isn't such a bad thing.” Kellan shrugs. “I mean, sure we look scary and lose control when it's a full moon but that's not every night. He just doesn't want the same happening to you as it did with Anna.”
“I fought the change because I didn't want to hurt anybody.” I quietly say.
“You won't hurt anyone Alice because you've got me and Ryder looking out for you.”
He grabs my hand gently and strokes his thumb against my skin. “'We won't let you hurt anyone, I promise.”
