NATURAL SOLUTIONS



Let us cut down on the amount of protein we eat each day, and eat foods high in

natural calcium. For good health we must eat our food in as natural a state as possible

without taking man-made supplements.

Note: Calcium in cow's milk is much coarser than in human milk, and is tied up with the

casein. This prevents the calcium from being fol y absorbed(9).



CALCIUM SUPPLEMENT CONTAMINANTS



Those taking calcium supplements in an attempt to prevent osteoporosis may be

consuming toxic trace metal contaminants. An analysis of samples of dolomite from a

health food store contained aluminum arsenic, cadmium, chronium, copper, lead,

manganese, selenium, and zinc(10).

PROSTATE GLAND

The prostate gland is red-brown in color and about the size of an English walnut. It is

located immediately under the bladder and in front of the rectum. It has three lobes, or

sections, enclosed side by side in a capsule. The urinary tube from the bladder passes

over the middle lobe; anything that happens there to swel the prostate- infection,

inflammation, cancer, etc., can enlarge these lobes and thus obstruct the flow of urine.

The prostate gland is the principal storage depot for seminal fluid. At each sexual

encounter the testicles provide over 200 mil ion sperm cel s. The function of the prostate is

to produce lubricating fluids and a special activating fluid in sexual activity that wil dilute

the sperm cel s. This seminal fluid is very high in zinc and also contains proteins,

enzymes, fats and sugars to nourish the sperm. It is alkaline to overcome the acidity of the

female tract and it is a very watery medium in which the sperm can swim toward the

female egg.

More zinc is found in the prostate gland than any other organ in the body. Zinc is a

trace mineral needed in only very smal amounts, but a deficiency can lead to major

medical problems. Zinc is found in high concentration in sperm and seminal fluid. The

brain also must have adequate zinc in order to keep the thoughts organized and balanced.

Excessive sexual practice may lead to depletion of zinc stores which may be fol owed by

both prostate disease and neurologic and mental disorders. Al nerve tissue is also

dependent for proper functioning on this trace mineral.

Each day the prostate produces from 1/10 to 2/5 of a teaspoon of seminal fluid.

During sexual arousal four to ten times that amount is produced. The prostate also

becomes congested with blood during arousal. An overactive sexual life can cause

chronic congestion in the prostate. Over a long period of lime, the prostate yields to the

constant pressure, enlarging to make room for the extra blood and seminal fluid.
