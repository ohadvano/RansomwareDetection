There's one thing I am curious about though. If Mr Edmund was the man with the son, who was the man with the daughter?
“Ask me the question you want to be answered, Alice.”
I look back at him, he grins at me. “Who was the man with the daughter.”
He chuckles. “Can you really not guess? Surely you know the answer to that.”
Why do I feel like it's related to me?
He nods. “Your father fell in love with my wife, and he left you and your mother to raise my son.” He emphasizes my.
I hear my heart beating in my throat. “No...”
“Yes, yes, yes!” He slams the desk with every yes. “Did you ever wonder where he was all these years? He's been overseas raising my son like his own, but can you imagine how happy I was when I learned that the man who took the woman I loved away from me had a daughter, in this very school.”
My eyes start to water. “I've got nothing to do with this. I hate my father for leaving me and my mother.”
