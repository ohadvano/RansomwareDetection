“If you're trying to get Ryder's attention, he won't spare you a glance dressed like that.”
She takes in my black skinny jeans, the band t-shirt and leather jacket.
I ignore her and get right to the point. “Have you seen Sam anywhere?”
“Why would I care about where your annoying little friend is?”
She picks up the solo cup next to her and drains the whole thing.
“Because I'm trying to look for her, and I'd really appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction?”
Silver gets down from the counter and sways seductively to stand in front of me. “Sure I'll point you in the right direction. Go find Sam yourself, leave this house and stay away from what's mine, otherwise I'll kick your ass.”
I look at her in confusion. “What are you talking about?” “Stay away from Ryder.”
“I couldn't care less about him. All I want to do is find Sam because she came on her own, and I just wanna see if she's alright.”
