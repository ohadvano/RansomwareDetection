“Your grandfather is a madman,” said Gatril. “You’ll die if you go there all on your own.”
“Well…” Kiran hugged Gatril around her waist. “I won’t be all by myself, now that I have a friend.”
Gatril gave Kiran and incredulous look. “What makes you think I’ll help you, human? I’m quite fine here in this forest. I can eat sleep, and have sex with the occasional beast, or batoiko that wanders off from his tribe…”
Gatril trailed off when Kiran smiled even harder at her. “Aww,” he said. “I see, so you’re a bit of a sexplorer yourself. Must’ve picked up a thing or two from the that human you were talking about.”
Her cover blown, Gatril said, “Yeah whatever. And your point is?”
“Then come with me,” Kiran said. “You and I can have lots of sex, now that my virginity isn’t weighing me down.”
Indeed, the prospect was tantalizing to the bosdrake, but her instincts had to consider the possible dangers that would be out there along their possible journey. “This continent has five kingdoms,” she said. “Between them are scattered clans and villages that war and trade with each other at times. If it were not for some villages pledging allegiance to these kingdoms with taxes in order for protection, these places would be in chaos. Not only will you have to worry about monsters, but humans are notorious for being capable of horrible things.”
“My parents already understand,” said Kiran. “My father already has two other sons besides me to carry on his name, and help in the carpentry business. He doesn’t hate me, but he doesn’t like that I took on his father’s profession. He says those are for the old days of witch doctors—that medicine has come far along with the sciences. But this world—it still has magic. I want to be a part of those old days of legends.”
Gatril heard the resolve in the young man’s voice and began to reconstruct her previous assumption. Perhaps he was more than just a stiff cock for her to sit on when she was in heat. “Fine, Kiran the sorcerer. I accept your request. However, I have a few conditions.”
“Sure,” Kiran said, “what did you have in mind?”
“First, I like my crotch licked,” Gatril said, “so you’ll have to be willing to give more than I will for you.”
Kiran nodded. “Okay.”
“Second,” Gatril continued, “assuming you’ll be fighting monsters, you’ll need my assistance. Henceforth, I’ll need to eat the best food money can buy, or we can hunt.”
Kiran nodded.
“And third,” said Gatril, “I wish to go to Lemuria.”
Kiran nodded on practice, then instantly gaped at the bosdrake when he realized what she said. “Huh? Lemuria…you mean one of the uncharted continents?”
“You heard me,” Gatril said. “I want to discover what grate foods lie there. However, the only port that exists there is own by humans, so I would need a human escort.”
“Um,” Kiran scratched his head. “Sure, but why do you want to venture so far all of a sudden?”
“Do you think humans are the only ones who like adventure?” said Gatril. “You presume beasts like to live in trees, caves and huts. We like material things as well, you know.”
“Okay,” said Kiran. “I can understand that. So, I’ve agreed to all your demands.” Kiran looked over Gatril and raised his hand halfway. “Do we shake on it or…”
Gatril presented the tip of her tail to Kiran. “Kiss it.”
“What?” he said.
“Kiss it,” she replied. “It will be proof of our allegiance.”
Kiran sighed. “You know, I think you’re getting back at me for trying to capture you.”
“Yes, actually,” Gatril retorted.
Kiran shrugged, and kissed her tail.

CHAPTER TWO

Kiran took three days to prepare for his journey, gathering clothes, food, weapons and the items necessary for crafting his spells. His home was situated in a large town of cottages composed of wood and concrete, broken up my many paved streets with those being bare earth in the communities.
Kiran pushed his quacycle through his front yard and out the gate. Just as he turned to close it, he saw his mother and father walking out of the house. His father had on leathery overall made from the skin of a buffalo, stained with grease and other unknown substances. His mother wore a simple blue frock and beneath her messy apron. 
“When will you be coming back?” his mother said, her round face looking perturbed.
“In about two weeks,” Kiran said. “I’ll need to register for the tournament soon.”
“So long?” she retorted. “Your allowance won’t last all that time, you know.”
“Don’t worry,” Kiran said, “I can find some jobs around the villages if I need to.”
