
(Diphyllobothrium latum), has been identified in man. Infection occurs when undercooked

fish is eaten .(9).

IF I DON'T EAT MEAT, WHERE WILL I GET MY PROTEIN?

Protein is the most complex of al food elements, and its assimilation and utilization

are the most complicated. The hardest food for the body to break down is protein. When

protein food is eaten, it takes more energy for it to go through the process of digestion

than any other food. Protein is not built in the body by eating protein. Protein is built from

the amino acids in food. It must first be digested and split into its component amino acids.

The body can then use these amino acids to construct the protein it needs.

There are twenty-three different amino acids that have been discovered. Fifteen of

these can be produced by the body; and eight must be derived from the foods we eat.

That is why these eight are cal ed essential. There are no "essential" amino acids in flesh

that the animal did not derive from plants, and that humans cannot also get from the

plants they eat. If you eat fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains on a regular basis, you are

receiving al the amino acids necessary for your body to build the protein it needs.

Plant foods contain al the amino acids necessary to make protein, according to

Suzanne Havala, author of the American Dietetic Association's position paper on

vegetarian diets. She says that it is no longer necessary to consciously "combine" plants

to make a complete protein. Eating a variety of plant matter and getting enough calories to

satisfy energy needs is a better way to insure that a vegetarian diet is healthy. She also

notes that the belief that animal products are necessary for healthy eating is simply based

on a combination of culture and habit.

Americans eat too much protein, from 80 to 125 grams a day. The human body

recycles approximately 70% of its protein and loses about 23 grams a day, that's eight-

tenths of an ounce. It is lost through the feces, urine, hair, skin and perspiration. The RDA

requirement for protein is 56 grams a day, which, I believe, is stil too high. I think that 30-

35 grams a day is more than adequate. The Hunza people and half a bil ion Hindus eat

very little protein and they have no protein deficiencies. Studies show that excess protein

in the diet is harmful, contributing to kidney disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, heart disease,

cancer, etc.



3000 PHYSISCIANS RECOMMEND ELIMINATING MEAT AND DAIRY

Wel , scratch the milk and meat, a physician's group advises. The Physicians'

Committee for Responsible Medicine announced a new attack on the "Basic Four" urging

the U.S. Department of Agriculture to replace the 35 year old guide with

new groupings that concentrate on fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole

grains, and with meat and dairy products optional. Who is this Physicians1

Committee for Responsible Medicine? They are a group of 3,000

physicians dedicated to preventive medicine. Why have they

recommended such a drastic deviation from our traditional four food

groups? They are aware of the overwhelming evidence which demonstrates that plant

foods not only provide adequate, but also superior nutrition. As one of the members of the

Committee, Dr. Denis Burkitt, an Irish surgeon, states, "Knowledge of the diet and lifestyle

to which we are genetical y coded wil lead to the prevention of disease".





40





NEW FOUR PROPOSED FOOD GROUPS





Grains - Breads, pasta, cereal, corn, millet and barley are rich in fiber,

complex carbohydrates, protein, 7 vitamins and zinc.





Vegetables - All provide essential nutrients, including Vitamin

C, beta-carotene, riboflavin, iron, calcium and fiber.





Legumes - Beans, peas and lentils are good sources of protein,

fiber, iron, calcium, zinc and B vitamins.





Fruits â€“ Rich in fiber, Vitamin C and beta-carotene. Choose

whole fruit over Juices, which donâ€™t contain As much fiber.

When you eat grains and vegetables, you are obtaining your food first hand; but when you

eat meat, you are getting your grains and vegetables second band. The only effect meat

eating has on health is that it deteriorates it.



42





GROUP II - ALL ANIMAL PRODUCTS, CHEESE, ICE CREAM, AND EGGS

(MILK COVERED IN ANOTHER CHAPTER )

Cheese has harmful effects on the body. As we know that milk

is harmful for one's health it Stands to reason that cottage cheese or

hard cheese would be doubly so, since it is concentrated and

fermented milk.

Rennet is used in the curdling of milk for cheese making.

Rennet is obtained from the whole stomach lining of calves, lambs,

kids or pigs. During the fermentation or curing of cheese, a mixed

group of microorganisms grows in the milk curd. Protein, fat, and carbohydrates are the

major nutrients affected during the curing process. The protein portion of cheese is

fermented to peptides, amines, indols, skateal and ammonia. The fat in cheese is

hydrolyzed to irritating fatty acids. The carbohydrates of milk, mainly lactose, is converted

to lactic acid by putrefaction. Most of the products of fermentation are toxic and irritating,

including the esters, the acids, and certain of the amines.

Polio viruses can survive in cheddar cheese throughout the life of the product. Most

cheeses are made of unpasteurized milk. Salmonel a, staphylococci, and brucel a

organisms can survive long periods in the cheese. A number of outbreaks of disease, as

wel as food poisoning, have been traced to cheese (10).





IGE CREAM AND ITS HARMFUL EFFECTS ON THE BODY

As we wel know, ice cream is usual y made from milk, sugar and eggs. We also

know that these are al harmful to one's health. But how many people are aware of some

of the other ingredients that are found in some ice creams? The

majority of ice cream manufacturers take ful advantage of the fact that

they are not legal y required to list al of the additives they use in

making ice cream. Operating on priorities of freezer stability, cost

effectiveness, and taste, they mix up concoctions of chemicals which

are packaged and sold as ice cream, but have no authentic claim to

the name. According to Arrow Magazine of September 1985,

laboratory analyses have found that the fol owing ingredients may

commonly be found in your cheaper grades of ice cream.

Diethyl glucol - A cheap chemical used as an emulsifier (agent used to hold two

ingredients together in Suspension) instead of eggs; identical y the same chemical used in

antifreeze and in paint removers.

Piperonal - Used as a substitute for vanil a; a chemical used to kil lice.

Aldehyde C17 - Used to flavor cherry ice cream; an inflammable liquid used in

aniline dyes, plastic and rubber production.

Ethyl acetate - Used to give ice cream a pineapple flavor; used as a cleaner for

leather and textiles, and its vapors have been known to cause chronic lung, liver and heart

damage.

Buytyraldehyde - Used in nut-flavored ice creams; also used as an oil paint solvent.



Amyl acetate - Used for a banana flavor; also used for oil paint solvent.



Benzyl acetate - Used for a strawberry flavor; also a nitrate solvent.





43





As Arrow so aptly puts it, "The next time you are tempted by a luscious

looking sundae or banana split or ice cream soda, think of it as a mixture of

antifreeze, oil paint, paint remover, nitrate solvent, leather cleaner and lice

kil er!" And if this is done to ice cream, what are they doing to color, flavor,

thicken and embalm hundreds of other foods on the store shelves?





EGGS AND THEIR HARMFUL EFFECTS ON THE BODY

Eggs are not a natural food, since they come from an animal source that contains

many diseases. Ordinary cooking of eggs, including boiling, frying and

baking, often fails to kil bacteria such as salmonel a in eggs.

A large number of al ergies are produced by the use of eggs.

Bladder al ergies resembling cystitis, urethritis, various skin

inflammations, gastrointestinal Symptoms, and even conjunctival

al ergies (reddening of the eyes) occur as a result of eating eggs. (11)

A cerebral food al ergy has been ascribed to eggs in which transient

loss of vision occurs, along with headache, hives, and partial amnesia. (12) Eggs are very

high in cholesterol, which leads to heart attacks and strokes. There is more cholesterol in

three eggs than there is in 2 pounds of hamburger; eggs account for over 1/3 of al the

cholesterol eaten in America. For optimum health we need to eliminate eggs from our diet,

and let eggs do what eggs were created for: to hatch baby chicks.





GROUP III - CHOCOLATE, BAKING POWDER AND SODA ARE

COVERED IN OTHER CHAPTERS





GROUP IV - SPICES ARE HARMFUL TO THE HEALTH

Spices have varying quantities of irritating chemicals in them. Al three types of

pepper (red, black, and white) have been shown to cause hemorrhaging

in the stomach. According to scientists at the University of Texas, black

pepper and turmeric alter cel s permanently. Turmeric causes breaks in

chromosomes in such a way as to alter the normal cel 's ability to

reproduce itself "Curry and other hot spices can cause damage to the

kidneys, particularly kidney stones." (13)

There are various condiments and spices that contain acids or volatile oils that are

potential y harmful to the kidneys. These include vinegar, black pepper, ginger, al spice,

mace and cinnamon. Some additional spices, which are irritating to the body and should

not be used, are: nutmeg, cloves, anise seed, caraway, chili powder, curry powder,

mustard, hot paprika, poppy seed, etc.





44





GROUP V - REFINED OILS

Oils are harmful to the body. Most plant foods contain very little fat, however,

modern food technology has made it possible to chemical y remove these

natural fats and process them into oil. Twelve ears of corn are processed to

make one tablespoon of corn oil. During the processing al the good fiber,

vitamins, minerals, enzymes, etc. are removed from the corn, leaving

nothing but oil which is 100% fat. Oils of any kind, whether corn oil, olive

oil, safflower oil etc.are not natural and are harmful to the body.

Al refined fats are a burden to the body, they thicken the blood,

slowing down circulation which affects the heart and blood vessels. These oils contribute

to overweight, diabetes, and gal stone formation; and recent studies suggest they may be

involved in breast and colon cancer (14)



GROUP VI - ALL REFINED SUGARS COVERED IN ANOTHER CHAPTER



GROUP VII - REFINED GRAINS

Refined grains are harmful to the body. Grains are made in

such a way that the vitamins and minerals are carried almost

entirely on the outer layer. Mil ing removes this layer leaving a

white, easily ground central kernel, which is almost devoid of

vitamins and minerals. The central portion has the starch and the

protein, but both of these are more difficult to metabolize without

the accompanying minerals and vitamins.

The mil ing of wheat into refined white flour removes much of the fiber, 40% of the

chromium, 86% of the manganese, 76% of the iron, 89% of the cobalt, 68% of the copper,

78% of the zinc and 48% of the molybdenum. These are al trace elements that our body

needs. The mil ing process also destroys a large percentage of the vitamins. Bleaching is

yet another process that destroys additional vitamins and minerals in grain.

Natural grains such as whole wheat, barley, corn, mil et, oats, rice and rye are what

we need for proper nourishment. But when these are mil ed they are almost worthless.



GROUP VIII - ALL VITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS COVERED IN

ANOTHER CHAPTER



SIMPLE RULES FOR EATING NATURAL FOODS

Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and supper like

a pauper. Eat your meals at regular times; and between meals eat

nothing. It is best that five hours elapse between meals. Two

meals a day, breakfast and the afternoon meal are better than

three for those who have a slow metabolism, who are overweight

and who have sedentary Jobs or do very little physical exercise.

Late suppers, just before bedtime, are particularly harmful, as

much of the food eaten is stored as fat instead of used. For those

who eat three meals a day, the third meal should be a light meal

and eaten several hours before going to bed.

As we learned in the chapter on water we shouldn't drink with our meals. Our water

can be taken up to 1/2 hour before our meal or else we have to wait until l hour after

eating before we drink.



45

The benefit derived from food depends upon the quality of food eaten. Good food

builds good blood; and poor food builds poor blood. Never eat fruit or vegetables if they

have any decay on them. Decayed fruit and vegetables ferment in the stomach and

poison the blood.

The ideal diet should have a balance of 80% of total calories as carbohydrates,

10% of total calories as fat, and 10% of total calories as protein. The ideal diet should

consist of at least 50% raw food, as raw food is live food. If one is sick, they need to eat

almost al their food raw. Take a cooked ear of corn remove a kernel and plant it and it wil

not grow, because cooked food is dead food. Whenever we cook food we destroy many of

the minerals and vitamins and al of the enzymes. For more detailed information on this

subject, see the chapter on "Fresh Food is the Best"





FOOD COMBINING

There are many food combining charts that are out on the market today, and each

one advocates different food combinations. Some of these charts are very complicated

and advocate not mixing a sweet fruit (apple) with an acid fruit (orange). I believe there is

some validity in this if you have a very weak stomach, but this doesn't apply to most

people. My chart is very simple and easy to understand. There are three different

characteristics of a true fruit and a true vegetable. A true fruit has seeds within it and a

true vegetable does not. A true fruit can only be eaten when it is ful y ripe, whereas a true

vegetable can be eaten at any stage of growth. A true fruit grows on a tree, vine, etc. A

true vegetable doesn't grow on anything, such as a carrot, onions, cabbage etc. It is best

not to eat fruits and vegetables at the same meal for the fol owing reason. Fruits digest in

from one to two hours. Whereas, vegetables take three to four hours to digest. Thus,

when eaten together, at the same meal, the fruits cannot leave the stomach until the

vegetables are digested. In most cases, Fermentation takes place in the stomach because

the fruits are held back. We also have a group of foods cal ed neutral foods, and they can

be mixed with either fruits or vegetables. These neutral foods consists of grains, nuts, and

vegetable-fruits. Foods such as the cucumbers, is a vegetable-fruit, because it has

characteristics of both the fruit, (has seeds within) and the vegetable, (it can be eaten at

any stage of growth) By fol owing this food combining chart, you wil have very few

problems with indigestion, gas, heart burn, or constipation.

"NATURAL" DEATH AND ITS CAUSES

To close this chapter out, I want to share a typical story with you that happens

many times every day here in the United States. Most American people with their poor

dietary habits, are kil ing themselves off by the thousands every day. You don't have to be

one of them.

On the morning of his 45th birthday, John Doe awoke to a peal of thunder. Glancing

out the window, he saw written fiery letters across the sky "Someone is trying to kil you,

John Doe." He didn't question the message. His only questions was "Who?"

At breakfast as he salted his fried eggs he told his wife, Mary, "Someone's trying to

kil me."

"Who?" she asked in horror.

John slowly stirred the cream and sugar into his coffee and shook his head.

"I don't know," he said.

On the way to the office John tried to think of a way to outwit his would-be

murderer. But the frustration of making time by beating traffic lights and switching lanes

occupied him whol y.

Nor, once behind his desk, could he find a moment to resolve the mystery, what

with jangling phones, urgent memos and the problems and decisions piling up as they did

every day.

It wasn't until his second martini at lunch that the ful terror of his position struck

him. It was al he could do to finish his steak. "I can't panic," he said to himself while

Lighting his cigar. "I simply must live my life as usual."

So he worked til seven as usual. Drove home as fast as usual. Ate a hearty dinner

as usual. Had his two Cocktails as usual. He took his usual two sleeping capsules in order

to get his usual six hours sleep.

As the days passed he manful y stuck to his routine. His pride grew as he managed

to go on living for years. But, as it must to al men, death came at last to John Doe. It

came at his desk on a particularly busy day. He was 54.

His grief-stricken widow demanded a ful autopsy, but it showed only emphysema,

arteriosclerosis, duodenal ulcers, cirrhosis of the liver, cardiac neurosis, a cerebrovascular

aneurysm, pulmonary edema, obesity, circulatory insufficiency and a touch of cancer.

"How glad Bil would have been," said Bil 's widow, smiling proudly through her

tears, "to know that he died of natural causes."





THE NATURAL WAY IS THE HEALTHY WAY

Natural foods encourage life, promote strength and endurance and help restore lost

health. Unnatural foods cause sickness and decay. You wil find the natural foods close to

nature, in the gardens and orchards. You wil find unnatural foods on the grocery shelf,

preserved and packaged in a bag, box or can.

It isnâ€™t any sacrifice at al to eat natural foods, It's just another step toward an

unblemished skin, a new spring in your step, a new light in the eye. It's a step toward a

strong heart and untainted breath. It's just another step toward untroubled sleep and new

vigor each morning. It's another step toward an unclouded mind and clear decisions. It's

just another step toward the abundant health you've always wanted.

PROPER REST





INSOMNIA AND SLEEPING PILLS



Almost 100 mil ion Americans occasional y suffer from insomnia; and another 20

mil ion complain of chronic sleep problems. Seven or eight times more women than men

report sleeping difficulties. Americans take about 600 tons of sleeping pil s a year. Side

effects from sleeping medications are too numerous to mention, but a few are depression,

skin rashes, poor coordination, digestive problems, respiration difficulties, etc.

For persons who sleep wel , insomnia is hard to understand.

The good sleeper lies down, closes his eyes and goes to sleep. The

insomniac's experience is decidedly different. He lies down, and

closes his eyes only to begin a nightly struggle to get enough sleep to

keep going through the next day. Emotionalism and anxiety are the

great enemies of sleep and the most common cause of insomnia.

Desperation for a decent night's sleep drives the insomniac into

taking sleeping pil s. The threat to good health that is bound up in a sleep-inducing drug is

apparently not considered. The toxic reaction is immediate, or side effects can sneak up

with one tablet, so the dose is upped to two; eventual y 3 or 4 might be needed to knock

him out for a night's sleep. And the idea of even attempting to sleep without the nightly

quota gives him a terrible feeling of uneasiness.



Meanwhile, instead of a wide-awake day, the drugged insomniac is bleary-

eyed and exhausted at work. Even his emotional reactions have been

changed. He is hard to get along with, unenthusiastic, and disinterested in

life. His wife gets on his nerves, and the children make him nervous. Before,

he was unhappy for two or four of the hours he should have been sleeping;

but now he's miserable for the sixteen hours he's awake.





PROPER REST IS ESSENTTAL

Rest is one of the most basic healers known to mankind. When you become sick,

what is the first thing you do? You lie down in bed most of every day, as wel as al the

night, until you recover, because the restorative power of rest is the key to health. Every

bodily power requires rest after exertion. Even your heart - the hardest working muscle in

your body - rests after each beat. You rest at the end of each breath.

Your muscles require relaxation after every contraction. During the sleeping hours

the body is busy repairing itself. Our bodies are a lot like a battery; They run down during

the day and need to be recharged at night. The most energetic people I know are quite

consistent in getting their rest.



One of the purposes of sleep is to repair losses and damage caused by work.

When awake, we eat as wel as work: that is, we both consume and replenish our stores

of energy. But the food we take in is not available as energy until it has become a part of

the living cel . Food in the stomach, in the blood and body fluids does not add to our store

of energy until it becomes a part of the body. After it is digested, it must be assimilated;

this work is largely done during sleep. This has been observed with the microscope. When



49





the cel is ful y rested, it is wel fil ed with minute energy granules. A tired cel shows the

granules greatly reduced in number.

Since the inception of television, mil ions of people do not

get enough sleep. They go to bed late, get up early to go to work,

and in the middle of the afternoon they have to force themselves to

keep going. The importance of sleep cannot be over emphasized

for it is during the restful hours of sleep that the body rebuilds its

tissue. One reason so many people have nervous breakdowns is

that they try to surpass their limitations. They are always on the go

without adequate rest, until the body machinery breaks under the

load. Take time to refocus your life; take time to rest. Go outside

and sit in a chair and do nothing. If the very thought of that sounds ominous to you, then

you are the very one who needs to change your attitude toward adequate rest. One does

not always have to sleep in order to rest. A change of pace, doing

something different, wil bring rest to your mind and body. If your daily

job is to sit behind a desk al day, rest for you might be to go out and

work in the garden in the evening. Whereas a farmer who works al

day would get his rest by sitting down in the evening chair and reading

a good book.





REST FOR TENSION OR FATIGUE



Tension increases as the day goes on until it is at a high point in the late afternoon.

If this point is reached day after day, week after week, the results may become

unbearable. But if the person takes a break at noon with a short nap, the tension drops

and he awakens for the afternoon's work with much improved nerves. The same rule

applies to young mothers attempting to raise children, run a house and maintain an active

social life. My advice to these mothers is to take naps with their children, for this wil

greatly reduce their tension and fatigue.





REST FOR THE EYES AND EARS



To protect your eyes, be careful to have the light coming over your shoulder on

your reading or your work, and not into your eyes. Be sure you have plenty of light. Don't

try to read in dimly lit rooms.

Fluorescent lights ruin the eyes as they blink on and off 60 times a second. Whenever

possible use outside light for reading and working. If you have to spend many hours of

reading, occasional y give your eyes a rest by looking out the window, closing them, or

doing some eye exercises.





Various forms of noise present in our modern age is one of the greatest enemies of

rest. Noise acts as a constant irritant to the entire nervous system of the body, whether we

are asleep at night, or during the day when we are awake. Eighty decibels represent the

level at which continuous or prolonged exposure to noise can result in hearing loss.

Normal conversation

Subway

Jet Airpor

120 db.

Shotgun Blast

140 db.





Noise has been shown to increase the stress level of those continual y exposed to

it. Those who work 20 years or more around noisy equipment have a life span 5 years

shorter than those working in quieter areas of the same firm. Television almost

consistently raises the stress hormone level in the blood regardless of the programming.

Rock music has also been shown to affect the body's stress level adversely.





HOW MUCH SLEEP DO WE NEED?

The requirement for sleep varies with age. A baby sleeps most of the time. A young

child before the age of 6 needs about 14 hours of sleep per day. A

grade school child needs at least twelve hours, and a teenager should

have from nine to ten hours of sleep per day. This much sleep is not

necessary for older individuals, but it is for young people. The adult

needs only to repair the daily waste of tissue, whereas the young

requires in addition much energy for growth and development.

Nevertheless, statistics show that good sleepers amongst the aged are

those who live longest. Sleep requirements may temporarily change. During il ness,

pregnancy or stress, a person may need more sleep.

When anxieties, cares and business perplexities are carried to bed, sleep during

the early hours is not refreshing and the time of sleep is necessarily extended. The

occupation during the day likewise regulates the amount of sleep at night. Brain workers,

and those undergoing severe nervous strains, require considerable sleep: their fatigue is

mental and nervous, and sleep is the only form of rest that is beneficial. People who are

doing manual labor, usual y fail to sleep readily upon retiring and don't require as many

hours of sleep.





STAGES OF SLEEP

Sleep is classified into two distinct states, Rapid Eye Movement (R.E.M.) is the first

state and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (N.R.E.M.) is the second state which accounts for

about 75% of the normal sleep. N.R.E.M. is divided into four

states. Stage 1 of N.R.E.M. sleep is a light sleep and a person

is easily awakened during this stage. Stage 2 of N.R.E.M. is a

deeper sleep with heart and respiratory rates slowing and the

temperature dropping. Stage 3 of N.R.E.M. begins 20 to 40

minutes after onset of sleep and the body processes continue to

slow down. Stage 4 begins about 10 minutes later; this is the

deepest sleep, and anyone awakened during this stage wil be

temporarily confused.



Within an hour or so of fal ing asleep, the sleeper rapidly progresses through three
