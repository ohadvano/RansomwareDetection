I shrug. “Sam and I don't really fit in with these kinds of people. We figured that out early on when we started school. We're a weird pair as you can see.”
“Really?” Max tilts his head. “I mean what kind of people do you have here?”
I point towards the back of the cafeteria. “At the back is where the jocks and cheerleaders sit. They consider themselves as being the top of the food chain.”
“They think they're better than everyone else?” Max frowns.
Sam puts her phone down and crosses her arms over the table. “To them, we are beneath them and nothing more than dog shit.”
Max looks behind him to look at the jocks and stares for a while. “No one should feel like dog shit.”
Sam snickers. “Yeah, try telling that to them.”
Sam stands and grabs her purse. “I'm gonna grab some lunch and if I remember correctly, it's curry day today which means salad for me. Fucking yay.”
As Sam walks to the salad bar, a few of the jocks from the back wolf whistle. I can't help but laugh when I see Sam turn to the back to give them the middle finger.
