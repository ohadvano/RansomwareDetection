“That’s right,” she said, amused Kiran was able to deduce it. “These spells actively feed off the user’s spirit energy and are active even when the user doesn’t think about it, so long as their spirit energy has not been diminished. While active ones, like your force-counter and earth-pillar, rely on you to command it in your mind and channel your spirit energy manually. But the Witching Tournament is also about flashy spells, so my next two will give me enhanced strength and the ability to make things float.”
“It looks like you’re going for a close-combat type of combination,” said Kiran. 
“It is,” said Aparna, getting up. “I’m going to brush my teeth. I have a spell book on the table you can check out if you want.”
“Oh, nice!” Kiran leapt up and towards the table. He snatched up the book and fell back in the bed. 
Kiran studied the texts in the book until Aparna got back. They delved into a conversation about which kind of magic combination was the most efficient, and recalled the most famous magic practitioners of past. No sex was brought up, not that Kiran was feeling particularly lusty, but more than once Gatril crossed his mind.
Three hours later they left the inn and decided to scout out the location of the forest, moving on foot to conserve the fuel of Kiran’s quacycle. Though Kiran walked around with Aparna, there were a few other foreigners in the town as well, easterners like Aparna and northerners whose light skin made them stand out like a giraffe amongst zebras.
Within little over half an hour they were able to find the street that ran from the heart of the town and into the forest. It also bore a small police port, were a few officers were stationed as lookout for potential smugglers and monsters, even incorporating a tower for an enhanced point of view.
Kiran and Aparna slowed their approach as an officer came to meet them. Kiran noticed his eyes paid more attention to Aparna, but he wasn’t surprised.
“Good afternoon children,” said the officer. “Where are you both headed?”
“Sir,” said Kiran, and the man switched his lustful gaze from Aparna to an annoyed one when he saw Kiran. “My name is Kiran Kehomba. I’m a sorcerer in training. I’ve come from my town to try and find popobawa parts for my spell. My friend her is accompanying me.”
“My name is Aparna,” she said. “I’m also a sorceress. We’re both trying to find resources to enter the Witching Tournament. I have a permit to enter this country and participate if you’d like to see.”
“Sure,” said the officer, “let me have them.”
Kiran and Aparna took out their IDs, and the officer gave Kiran’s a quick glance and handed it back to him. However, he carefully ran his fingers over Aparna’s hand as he took hers. She frowned and wiped her hands in her clothes, but the officer merely cackled and looked at her identification. “Aparna Borasing. Gabanyese, eh?”
“Yes,” she said. 
“Are we allowed to venture into the forest, sir?” said Kiran.
“…We don’t recommend it,” the man said thoughtfully. “If you do enter the forest however, you’ll have to sign a contract with the authorities giving your consent to be the ones solely responsible for your own wellbeing.”
“Sure,” said Kiran. “We’ll sign once we’re coming back. Come on Aparna.”
The young woman snatched her ID from the officer and followed Kiran back into town. They decided to take a walk along one of the factories to explore how far the advancements in technology in the country had gone. 
The facility was surrounded by a large fence of wooden posts, and through the large open door, the two could see trolleys and small carts carrying hunks of metal to and from the back.
Kiran looked up at the sign which read “Okoyo’s Engine Repair Service”. “Do you think they made a spell that can combine magic and machines?” said Kiran.
“Not to my knowledge,” said Aparna. “I don’t think that would even be allowed in the tournament either.”
“Would’ve been cool though,” Kiran said. “I know you have knights who are good at using gadgets.”
“Gadgets malfunction, spells don’t,” Aparna snapped. “Let’s go already. I still need to get the tingle of that policeman off me.”
Kiran shrugged and continued with Aparna back to the inn. While Kiran studied his book of spells once more, Aparna was just about finished with her knew spell, having gathered the ingredients to mix with the zebra semen and turn into an orb. She had a large bracelet with three sockets, one of which she fitted the orb into. Aparna channeled her spirit energy into the stone and locked the bracelet around her foot.
“Okay, all done,” said Aparna.
Kiran closed the book and sat up. “Okay. Let’s go see what Gatril’s up to.”
The two took his quacycle and rode out of the town. On the outskirts they made their way to the set of trees Gatril had indicated to them, only to find a giant, round mass of branches bent and woven into a nest.
“What in the world is that?” said Aparna.
“Don’t worry,” said Kiran as he parked his vehicle outside from the structure. “I think she just made a house.”
They got off and walked towards the nest, though Aparna kept a cautious distance behind Kiran. The boy turned on a new lantern he bought and carefully brought its light close to the entrance of the nest. “Gatril…?”
“What?” The voice came from behind them, and both humans spun around hysterically to see Gatril falling from the tree.
“G-Gatril!” Kiran said. “Don’t scare us like that!”
“That wasn’t nice, dragon,” said Aparna, her hand on the grip of her gun. “I could’ve shot you.”
“If you did, I would’ve bitten your head off.” And Gatril smiled, displaying her formidable teeth.
Kiran quickly went between them and said, “Hey, you two knock it off. We just came here to see how you are Gatril.”
“Check this out Kiran,” said Gatril. She turned away from everyone, inhaled briefly, and exhaled from her throat a stream of cloudy, green substance in the air. Kiran and Aparna got a whiff of it and immediately felt their heads going fuzzy and their knees buckling.
“Gyaaah!” Kiran covered his nose and hurried out of the mist. He fell on his knees. “G-Gatril, what is this stuff?”
Aparna fell on her bottom, wrapping her mouth and nose with her cloak. 
Gatril was all smiles despite the unhealthy predicament of her comrades. “You guys like it? It’s a special plant I ate. Bosdrakes have the ability to regurgitate specific chemicals in the food we eat.”
As the green fog disappeared, Kiran and Aparna rose to their feet, taking deep breaths so their lungs could recover. 
“You could’ve at least given us a warning,” said Aparna.
“That would’ve spoiled the surprise,” said Gatril. “Kiran, did you bring any food?”
“…Yeah,” he said. He handed her the basket. 
Gatril took it and flung the top open. “Hmmm, pork,” she said, the fragrance immediately watering her mouth. 
“We better leave fun time for tomorrow night,” said Kiran. “We’ll need all our strength against the popobawa. I’ll sleep out here with you tonight just to make sure we’re safe.”
“I told you already, I don’t need your company,” said Gatril.
“It’s not up for discussion.” Kiran crept into the nest and carefully placed the lantern in the center of the floor of matted leaves. He put his knapsack in the corner along with Gatril’s small items.
“Excuse me,” said Aparna. “What do you two mean by, funtime?”
Gatril swallowed the piece of meat in her mouth and said, “Sex.”
“…I see,” said Aparna. “You two seem to have quiet the relationship.”
“We’re just friends with benefits,” said Gatril.
Aparna made a lopsided grin. “He’s a really good friend to be staying out here around predators with a dragon.”
Aparna’s words slipped into Gatril’s ears like a salted worm, wriggling about and stirring up unwanted thoughts—thoughts she didn’t want to entertain. “He’s a good human. That’s why I’m following him. Now are you going to come inside or not?”
“I’ll head back to the inn,” said Aparna, a slick smile on her lips.
“Good,” said Gatril. “Now go away and leave me and my friend alone.”
Aparna chuckled and made her way back to the town.
The following evening, Kiran went back in town to pick up fuel for his quacycle, and on his way out he fetched Aparna. He returned with her to Gatril’s hut, getting her to add the final piece to his party. The trio rode around town, testing the limits of the single large seat with the women behind Kiran; Gatril in the center. As a result, their weight made their pace slow, but they had intended to pay keen attention to their surroundings.
Along with the lantern Kiran had placed at the front of his vehicle, Aparna steadily held a torch in her hand despite the slight bumps on the road. Gatril’s keen sense of smell, sight and hearing would also alert them to anyone their lights couldn’t reveal. Despite a few critters and the croaks and chirps of the nocturnal residents, they found nothing out of the ordinary.
“We’re here,” said Kiran as they reached the cluster of trees. Darkness stared back at them, silent and waiting.
“We should stop here and set up bait,” said Aparna.
Kiran said, “Good idea,” and proceeded to park the vehicle in the grass along the path.
Kiran went to the back of the quacycle and took out the items needed to attract the popobawa. 
The popobawas were beings with an appetite for blood, so Kiran took out a jar of cow’s blood and poured it into a bucket, enhancing the fragrance with special chemicals. Gatril helped to place it on a large piece of wood similar to a rat trap, only instead of throwing over an iron bar to crush whatever would take the bait, it had a hollow holder container a powdered plant that would be launched at the unsuspecting victim. The powder of the plant would then paralyze the target when inhaled.
They carried the trap a few yards into the forest, knowing the popobawa wouldn’t want to venture out of its cover, and quickly sprinted out of the trees before their prey caught on to them. 
Kiran, Gatril and Aparna crouched in a nearby brush, silently waiting on the popobawa to take the bait.
“How long will we have to be here?” said Gatril.
“I don’t know,” said Kiran.
They heard and abrupt sound. A creaking one of sorts. It struck them silent, and they strained their ears.
Aparna said, “That…sounded like the trap, Kiran.”
“Already?” Kiran sounded incredulous. 
Gatril, unlike the humans, immediately realized what was going on. “It’s the trap alright, but way too soon. Something must’ve seen us coming—or has been waiting on us.”
“W-What?” Kiran sounded panicky. “B-But who?”
Something landed before them. They sprung up and scattered themselves to get room to commence battle. 
“What the hell was that?” Kiran said. He quickly switched on the lantern, revealing the bucket of blood. 
“It threw the bucket back!” Aparna said.
Gatril went to Kiran and took the lantern from him. “What are you doing?” he said.
Gatril ignored Kiran and tossed it in the grass near the trees. With the dry weather they were having, the ground quickly caught fire. Gatril retreated with the others, waiting impatiently as adrenaline surged through her veins.
“Come on you bastard,” Gatril sneered.
Then their adversary walked into the light, his formed revealed. The officer from the forest lookout post.
“You!” Kiran said.
“I knew I felt something off about him,” said Aparna.
The officer didn’t have any firearms, but then again what fun would they be? He was all smiles as he waltz towards them. “I told you children it was not a good idea to come into the forest. Now I’ll have to show you why.”
Gatril stood before Kiran, bearing her teeth. “Kiran, get back and use that spell of yours. Aparna, can you fight?”
Aparna took off her cloak and took out her revolver and knife. “I wouldn’t have been here if I couldn’t.”
Kiran kept his focus and channeled his spirit energy into his staff. “Popobawa!” he said. “I came here only for your queex. If you can masturbate and give it to me, I can give you anything else in return but us!”
“Oh, boy, but I do want you all,” he said. The man’s body suddenly gave off a dark mist and broke apart, recombining into a lanky figure with gruesomely sharp claws on its hands and feet, and dark hair swaying off her head with the texture of bristles.
The shape was undeniably feminine; a small waist with wide hips, and ample breasts. Her face had a single red eye glaring at them like hot coal, above a half-open mouth filled with sharp teeth. Her ears were pointy, her skin of a reddish hue, and striking, membranous black wings sprouted out of her back like the cursed sails of an old, lost ship.
Kiran clenched his ass cheeks. “Yeeek!”
“I’ll drink your blood and screw you all!” the popobawa said, and her clitoris abruptly swelled until it resembled a throbbing phallus.
“Attack!” said Gatril, lunging at the popobawa.
She leapt over the bosdrake and struck her in the back with her foot. Gatril winced and fell, but got up and leaped at her once more. The popobawa attacked but Gatril slammed her tail into the popobawa’s thigh.
The bat-creature yelled and took to the sky with a flap of her wings, cackling dreadfully as she zipped through the air. The popobawa dove at them with the intended vice-grip of her talons, forcing the trio into a frantic duck-for-cover scenario.
Gatril and Aparna tried to counter with acid and gunfire, but the popobawa was too fast for their attacks.
The flying attacker came after Kiran, and the boy ducked and fell. He still clung to his staff, pulling water from the air into a huge ball that had already grown as big as himself.
“Everyone!” said Gatril. “I’ll use my stun-fog! Cover your noses!”
Gatril predicted the popobawa had become quite comfortable in her swooping technique, and if she could just execute it when the popobawa was in her descent, it would affix her into a dive right into Gatril’s attack.
But the popobawa struck first, vomiting a dark smog. She flew in a circle around them to completely shroud them in the black smoke.
Aparna fanned the substance from her face and pulled her blouse over her nose. She turned to Kiran, but his form immediately became obscured. “Kiran!”
“Gatril? Aparna?” Kiran called to his friends, but could only hear them. He could vaguely make out the massive sphere of water before him. 
Almost ready, he thought.
Not even Gatril’s feral eyes could penetrate the darkness, yet alone that of the humans. But the popobawa’s single eye was specifically designed for such a task, able to clearly discern their body temperature and shape.
And Kiran was the perfect option for the popobawa. The popobawa snatched him by his shoulders and hoisted him into the air.
“Uhh! Help! Let go of me!” Kiran kicked but his thrashing was piddly compared to the strength of the popobawa.
“Don’t worry!” the popobawa said. “You’ll be screaming a whole lot when I bust open that ass of yours.”
Below, Kiran could see the smoke clearing, and the flames continuing to spread. No! Kiran thought. I got everyone into this mess! I should be able to save myself!
Kiran felt his spirit energy depleting, but the water he gathered was enough. He launched the liquid sphere over his head and it shuddered, bulged and popped. 
Water fell in huge droplets with the force of stones. They splattered upon the popobawa, continuously pushing her down and hitting against her wings—just as Kiran had planned earlier.
The popobawa swore and snarled. “Blast! You damn boy!”
Kiran clutched the staff and wailed upon her repeatedly. “Let go of me!” he said.
When the smoke cleared, Gatril saw the two in the air struggling. “Shit…” She tried to come up with a plan and turned to Aparna for assistance. 
However, the young woman seemed to have been a step ahead of her.
Resting her shooting arm on her other for support, Aparna used the last light of the vanquishing flames to aid her sight as she aimed at the popobawa. Once she had him in her sights, she smiled. “One point for me,” she said
Aparna fired. 
The muzzle flashed. 
The bullet found its mark, and the popobawa screamed, releasing Kiran. They both plummeted, and the women below screamed in despair.
But Kiran wouldn’t have it. His death wouldn’t be here. 
The young sorcerer reached out and grabbed the popobawa by the arm and pulled her close. Channeling the last of his spirit energy into his staff, Kiran used the force-counter spell to propel them across the sky. The blast was enough to change their trajectory and decrease their momentum. 
They hit the ground from seven meters up, and Kiran’s vision suddenly went dark.

Kiran woke the next morning to find himself the dimly lit confines of Gatril’s nest. His eyes were instantly met with Aparna sitting next to him, and Gatril along with an olive-skinned woman, her hands bound behind her and a vexed pout on her face.
“Hey…” Kiran said to everyone, his voice feeble. He tried sitting up but electric pain sat him back down. “Ouch…”
“Don’t move around too much,” said Aparna, gently pushing him back down. “You broke a few ribs and your right arm.”
Kiran responded to the news with distress. He looked at his arm and saw it in a sling, and the bandages on his shoulders and leg. “Aww man.” Kiran groaned. Then he suddenly remembered and his eyes came alight. “Wait a minute, where’s the popobawa?”
“Right here,” said Gatril, gently shoving the strange woman. “We threatened to cut off her clit if she didn’t hand over his queex, so she shapeshifted into this woman.”
Kiran stared at the woman once more, concern replaced with intrigue. She had a slim build and perky breasts, and her crotch was covered in thick pubic hair. “Oh, alright.”
“Bastards,” said the popobawa, its voice high pitched to match its female form. “Just hurry already so I can leave.”
“You’re not in the position to be making demands,” said Gatril. “You’re gonna satisfy my friend to the fullest.”
“Are you sure about that, Gatril?” said Aparna. “Kiran can barely move yet alone thrust his hips.”
“Oh, that’s simple,” said Gatril as she stood and removed her bra and loincloth. “I’ll just get the queex from her for him. You can stimulate Kiran while he watches.”
Kiran shot Aparna a startled glance. It seemed outrageous to think this newcomer would be willing to join their special recreational activity. Aparna met Kiran with a contemplative, almost cynical stare, making him retract his neck in embarrassment.
Kiran turned to Gatril and said, “I think Aparna would be more willing to get the queex from her while you do me.”
“That’s fine,” said Aparna. 
“I-It is?” stammered Kiran.
Aparna stood and took off her clothes. “I’ve always wanted to try a Tatanuese man.”
Aparna’s pubic hair was shaved in a “V” pattern. The fresh smell of bitterweed and sweat wafted off into Kiran’s nose, arousing his sense like an intoxicating drug. 
Aparna gently laid next to Kiran and pulled down his underwear, stroking his swelling penis. She kissed him, and brought her chest up to his face where he could see her dark nipples ready and waiting. As Kiran nibbled and sucked on them, his flaccid phallus had swollen into a sturdy pole.
Gatril got a bowl and got behind the popobawa, sitting her down in her lap and spreading open her legs. Kiran multitasked amongst milking Aparna’s nipple, fingering the inside of her warm damp crotch and watching as Gatril placed the jar between the popobawa’s legs, kissing her cheek and neck.
The popobawa felt Gatril’s clawed fingers slide inside her and winced. “Aah! S-Slow down!”
“Quiet,” said Gatril, and locked her lips with hers, swiveling her tongue in her mouth. The bosdrake tweaked the popobawa’s nipple and vigorously fingered her. The popobawa moaned against her will, unwittingly riding the hand inside her with the contractions.
Aparna applied another wet kiss on Kiran’s lips before she knelt over him and slowly crawled back. Her dark, mysterious eyes glinted like black pearls, locking Kiran in an entrancement. She took his penis and nibbled on it. Kiran bit his lips and twisted his nose. Aparna licked his shaft from the base to the tip. Then she engulfed it.
Kiran had thought the inside of a woman’s vagina was spectacular, but Aparna was proving him silly for ever having considered such a thing. 
As Aparna vibrated her tongue on the tip of Kiran’s penis, her lips applied suction that almost pulled the blood out of him, bobbing her head with the force of a engine’s piston. Kiran clenched his teeth and clutched the leaves on the floor, resisting the urge to scream. Across from him Gatril unleashed upon the popobawa a cataclysmic sensation as well that had her making muffled screams. Spit and froth fell from between her and Gatril’s lips, as did Aparna’s mouth as she vacuumed the energy from Kiran.
Kiran unleashed a mighty roar, as he did his semen slapped into the back of Aparna’s mouth. The popobawa screamed. Her body quaked, and like a busted pipe her queex sprayed on the floor and inside the bowl.
Gatril took her tongue out of the popobawa’s mouth and allowed the woman to catch her breath. Gatril pushed her aside and took up the bowl. While she brought it over to a jar, Aparna approached the popobawa on the ground and took her by the head. Aparna’s lips were tight, and she pried open the popobawa’s mouth. She was too weak to resist as Aparna slowly opened her lips, and the semen plopped onto her tongue.
“Now be a good girl and swallow,” Aparna said.
The popobawa reluctantly ingested the semen, grimacing. “That was disgusting.”
Aparna patted her head and kissed her. “That’s karma for you.” She laid the woman onto her back and stooped over her face. “Now, time for round two.”
“That’s right,” said Gatril, also with her bottom over Kiran’s face. “Time for you two to make us feel good.”
“At least my tongue isn’t injured,” said Kiran, giggling along with the other women. The popobawa, though frustrated with its defeat, was at least pleased to know a cock wouldn’t be penetrating her, and as Aparna and Gatril sat, both her and Kiran leisurely began eating out the snatch of the women.
Kiran and the popobawa were experts in their own right, able to maintain a rigid flexibility to their tongues while the women bounced on their faces. Aparna and Gatril increased their pace as they made sensuous moans. Aparna was first to reach her climax, then Gatril.
The popobawa licked the scented liquid off her face, savoring the taste. “You Gabanyese women are spicy.”
Aparna saw a tiny smile on the popobawa’s face. “Thanks for the compliment,” she said.
Getting up, Gatril said, “Sounds like someone’s enjoying themselves. In that case…” Gatril gestured for Aparna to get off the popobawa, and the bosdrake cut her restraints with a claw. She helped her to her feet and motioned to Kiran. “Why don’t you finish things off for us.”
The popobawa saw Kiran looking at her expectantly, stroking his still rigid cock with one hand. He smiled at her. She made a frown, but Kiran could tell it was forced. “Why don’t you come over here and…have a seat.”
The popobawa smirked. “None of you tell anyone about this.”
“My lips are sealed,” said Gatril. She turned and kissed Aparna—stuck her fingers inside her. “Let’s cuddle.”
The popobawa crawled over Kiran. She kissed him on his lips, his chin, his neck. With one hand she steadied his penis and slowly sat on it. She moaned softly at the pressure against her insides at the size that filled her. “…Boy…you have a gift it seems.”
Kiran held on her waist with his one hand, while she pressed against his chest. The popobawa started out with slow motions of with her hips. She leaned over Kiran and offered her breasts to him, and happily obliging, the boy sucked on each of them. 
The popobawa chuckled and held him close. Their love sounds filled the nest, with Aparna and Gatril watching from the other side. Once the popobawa felt Kiran’s grip tighten on her flesh she knew what was coming. She clenched her muscles and held him in place as Kiran’s warm juices flooded inside her. The popobawa closed her eyes and as the hot fluid nestled inside her, her flesh willingly absorbing everything he had to offer.
“Wow,” said Gatril. “That was…”
“Sensual,” said Aparna.
“Well,” Gatril said, “I was thinking more of, fricking aces!”

Kiran got some more rest, though a beast such as the popobawa, who called herself Trewanti, was already beginning to recover from the non-lethal wound. While Aparna went back to the inn to fetch Kiran some more supplies, Gatril and Trewanti got wet clothes and wiped down Kiran, also giving him mint sticks to remove the smell of crotch from his breath.
Trewanti kept any thoughts or opinions behind her sealed lips most of the time, raising both Kiran’s and Gatril’s interest. After they’d put on back his shorts, Kiran said, “Trewanti…”
“Yes?” the woman sat on the ground and crossed her legs. She was still naked, still in her humanoid skin. 
“So, what will you do now?” said Kiran.
Trewanti smiled with a playful charm. “I’m still a popobawa. I need to feed.on blood, and I still possess my urge for intercourse, especially with beasts and humans anally.”
Kiran sighed, and said, “Do you think could not feed on humans or beasts, just animals? I wouldn’t want to have to confront you like this again.”
“Ai,” said Trewanti, “you humans and your demands. Always acting like you have the right to everything.”
“The request is fair enough,” said Gatril, folding her arms. “Just stop killing and raping humans and beasts.”
Trewanti returned a contemptuous gaze at Gatril, and said, “Is that how he got you? He beat you up, captured you and force you to suck his cock?”
“Nope,” said Gatril, “I actually captured him when he tried to. I just so happen to have taken a liking to him and let him mount me.”
Kiran laid an annoyed scowl upon Gatril. “No one needed to know that?”
“And you believe they don’t think that?” said Gatril. She turned to Trewanti. “He’s my sex companion.”
“I’m a sorcerer too,” said Kiran assertively. “I’m on my way to enter the Witching Tournament. The last thing on my list is a j’bafofi.”
Gatril saw the chink in Trewanti’s smile and said, “What, you don’t think he can do it?”
“I never said that,” said Trewanti. “I’m just wondering how’ll he’ll deal with the competition.”
“What are you talking about?” Kiran’s displeasure lead him to ignore his discomfort and sit up. 
“I take it you mean the female j’bafofi,” said Trewanti. “In that case, she always has many of her males trying to impress her with the sole intent of planting their seeds inside her. If they fail, she simply eats them.”
“I know that,” said Kiran. “I have plans to take her down.”
“The simple traps you have?” Trewanti chuckled, her mocking tone reverberating in Kiran’s ear. “They’re around thirteen j’bafofi nests in this country, the closest being in the Preteblu Hills seven miles from here. Rumors say that they’ve already overrun a small town; the males in particular, trying their best to impress the female with special human trinkets.”
“All the more reason to go there,” said Kiran. “If I can stop that J’bafofi, I can make a name for myself too.”
Trewanti bent the stiffness out of her neck. “I wish you the best of luck. I’ll go back to my home in the forest—with your requests in mind. I might consider prostitution. I’m sure I can find some homosexuals who like their assholes plowed.”
Kiran grimaced. “Okay. It’s better than rape, I guess.”
“Are you coming with us Aparna?” said Gatril.
Aparna took a sip of her malt beverage and said, “No. My work here is done. I need to collect the last ingredients for my other spells.”
“We can help you if you want,” said Kiran. “It’s the least I can do.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Aparna replied. “My quests aren’t as dangerous as yours.”
Gatril smacked Kiran with her tail. He winced and rubbed his thigh. “Ouch, Gatril!”
“Stop being so pushy already,” Gatril said. “The women don’t have time to be your little sex maids. Trewanti has blood to suck and Aparna has...animals to attend to.”
Kiran said, “Well good luck then, guys.”
“Thanks,” said Aparna. 
Trewanti remained silent, only shrugging. 
“When are you leaving, Kiran?” said Aparna.
“I think I’ll need about four days for my arm to heal,” said Kiran.
“So short?” said Gatril.
“Spirit energy can be used to heal the body,” said Kiran. “I need to start working on that spell too before the queex goes off.”
“Don’t worry,” said Trewanti, slightly opening her legs. “There’s always more when you need it, young sorcerer.”

CHAPTER FIVE

Three days of preparation, and the young wizard and his dragon accomplice were ready for the final leg of their journey. The morning started off with a hearty breakfast of oatmeal, bread and pork. They went over their equipment; Kiran mostly taking up that task.
Kiran had gotten some more supplies from the merchants in town, storing them in the back of his quacycle and backpack. Trewanti was the first to leave, transforming into her frightening form and flying back to the forest. Kiran and Gatril got onto the quacycle and rode off, waving back at the shrinking image of Aparna.
The quacycle’s wheels spun over miles of earth and grass uphill until their destination faded into sight. 
It was once called Ashfield Road, named after the legend of bodies that were burnt after a massive war between two tribes, and the crisp remains of the corpses had rained upon the land that day like dark snowflakes. But that was decades ago, and now lush trees that called all manner of wildlife within the surrounding greenage stood here, hence its new name the Preteblu Hills.
 Mongooses scuttled across the ground and gay birds chirps and flew overhead. The leaves ruffled like paper being crushed next to the ear in the winds, and for the briefest moment, the thought of confronting ferocious beasts slipped out of Kiran’s mind.
Gatril felt his muscles relax, and the quacycle slowed. “You feeling okay?”
“I’m good,” Kiran said.
Gatril tightened her arms around Kiran, and rested her chin atop his locks. Regardless of the barriers of their species and social standing, the comfort of his presence was too good to pass up on. 
“We’re almost there,” Kiran said.
And that was when their ambushers struck, barging out of the bushes with clubs, machetes and crude-looking blasters in hand. 
They were of the shape of men, hairy with a hyena’s snout and ears, hunched over with a mane of bristly hair running from their backs atop their heads. Grating cackles filled Kiran’s and Gatril’s ears, and they quickly stopped the quacycle and hopped off as the seven beasts surrounded them.
“What are they?” Kiran said, switching between the individuals, the stones in his staff already lambent from his spirit energy.
“Bultungins,” sneered Gatril. She forcefully flicked her tail around unpredictably, sending a message to the beasts one foul move would befall something horrible upon them.
They all wore various animal skins that had crudely torn edges, and all manner of trinkets that seemed to have sculpted by more skilled hands as opposed to the dirty, clawed ones of the bultungins.
Kiran knew the human crafts in particular the bultungins didn’t get by righteous means.
One with his mane dyed white approached them, eagerly tapping a femur tipped with an axe-head in his palm. He rose above them by inches, and the width of his shoulders told the pair a blow dealt by his hand would be fatal.
“Little meatballs,” he said, “you look like you’re a long way from home.”
“Yeah,” giggled one of the others, gesturing with his machete, “you tell ‘em boss.”
“Piss off!” said Gatril, keeping her eyes on the ones with blasters. “I’ll melt you all alive if you touch us!”
The leader grinned, and gobbets of saliva reeking of rotten flesh fell from his mouth. “Hey boy, hand over that quacycle and your stuff, or we’ll show you how our gang does things around here.”
Kiran touched Gatril, stealing her attention. She saw the glow of his spirit energy in the jewels on his staff, and face laced with concentration. She realized his stance wasn’t that of a coward seeking someone to save him from his demise, but a man trying to gather his bearings to access the situation.
Kiran wasn’t afraid anymore.
“Last warning,” said Kiran, unflinching, “leave us alone.”
Two of the bultungins charged and abruptly stopped, baring their teeth. It was a tactic meant to inject fear and unease into their targets, but Kiran’s countenance reflected his inward annoyance rather than the terror they’d hope to see.
Realizing this, the leader couldn’t let this standoff continue with words. He dropped his axe by his side, tensing his arm. “Don’t say I didn’t try to play nice. Get ‘em!”
And Kiran tapped the ground with his staff. Earthen walls sprung up with multiple quakes, catapulting two bultungin into the air and barricading Kiran and Gatril from their gunfire.
Gatril instantly followed up by jumping onto one of the walls and into a bultungin with a gun. She twisted her body and slapped him away with her tail. She sprinted on all fours, darting left and right, tripping them with her tail and cutting them open with her claws.
“Blast!” The leader turned and ran. “Let’s get outta here!”
The remaining two men fled with their boss. 
But Kiran wasn’t having it, and he holsters his staff and took out his cannon. Kiran aimed it at the bultungin running through the trees and fired with honed precision. The sticky blob knocked the leader in the head and grounded him.
Gatril darted after the others and leaped into the back of one with the force of a raging bull. She heard a loud snap of something vital to the beast, and switched to the other one. Gatril hawked up an acidic ball that splattered onto his back. The bultungin wailed at the sound of his sizzling flesh; like fresh lava had been poured onto him.
Kiran went to the quacycle to check if he had accidentally damaged his vehicle in the ruckus, while Gatril dragged the leader back to the side of the road.
Gatril tossed him by his foot unceremoniously before Kiran. “Start yapping,” she said.
The cowering bultungin raised his trembling hands before him as if he expected one of the two to stomp-in his face. “I-I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to attack you!”
“Where did you get all those ornaments?” said Kiran.
“We found them in a town up ahead,” he said. “It was overrun by the j’bafofi. The entire place has been murdered. The only people there are the dead ones. W-We just happened on it and found all this jewelry. Then they chased us out!”
“They…?” said Gatril.
“The males!” the beasts said, his lips wet with disdain. “The bastards chased us out. They want all the territory for themselves to farm food to impress the female.”
“Thanks for the information,” said Gatril, kicking the man in ribs. “Now get going!”
But the bultungin couldn’t move from the hellish pain Gatril inflicted on him, and the two simply went the quacycle and left the squirming gang of beasts. 
Another path veered off the main one into a hazed outline of buildings, and they followed it. Though the wind blew, the tees barely moved as if they were petrified, and the birds didn’t take to them either. But the closer Kiran and Gatril got, they saw the reason for this.
A galaxy of webs had been thrown over the trees like a white sheet stretched to the thinnest fiber. They knitted the leaves and branches dead stiff, preventing the grace of the winds from permitting them a swaying dance. Hung within them like the leftover of a demented child’s macabre play things were dried corpses of animals who’d fallen prey.
And on their path into the town, it was no different. The webs were all over the buildings, and Kiran decided he better save his vehicle from going further into the webbed museum and turned off the engine. He and Kiran got off, looking for anything that waited to surprise them. 
“Do you smell anything, Gatril?” said Kiran.
Gatril’s nose inhaled the choking smell of rotten wood, alkaline and something dead. “Nothing out of the ordinary,” she said. “I never picked up the scent of a j’bafofi before.
Kiran saw the unattended windows and doors. It ran across his mind to search them, but he remembered something about spiders. They were creatures of stealth, lying in wait for something to carelessly wonder into their trap of threads and deliver a paralyzing blow, leaving the prey defenses as its organs were liquified and consumed alive.
A most gruesome ending Kiran didn’t want him and his friend to fall to.
“Gatril,” he said. “Either they’re hiding in the buildings, or they’re out hunting.”
“Then what do we do?” she said. “Should we lay the trap here? This isn’t the queen’s lair.”
Kiran considered his options, and said, “I guess I’ll take that chance.” 
He went to his quacycle, only to have a six-legged fiend fall off a roof onto it. 
It had a glaring pink-red coloration, and a pale face with beady black eyes above two nostrils and its jittering mouthparts that possessed actual human teeth.
Kiran screamed and ran away, stopping once next to the muscular bosdrake. “Eeek! Spider!”
Gatril took the cannon Kiran gave her off her back and positioned the arachnid within her sights. She had previously switched the sticky rounds with a cartridge that held eight lead bullets.
Just one of these creatures made the bosdrake and human nervous, and when more of them crawled out of the houses, unconditional terror embraced them.
“There are dozens of them!” said Kiran, looking at the spiders blocking off all exits. Their thoraxes were long, narrow and flexible, a design granting them the ability to aim their spinnerets over their heads. Their front legs were modified into three-digit grasping appendages. Their mouths made clicking and snapping sounds that Kiran’s ears couldn’t translate.
“Gatril, can you understand them?” he said.
“I’m not familiar with their language I’m afraid,” she said. She saw them inching their way closer. She roared, they snapped into a quick retreat, but advanced once again. All of this spoke to Gatril. They didn’t have the intelligence of beasts to know what a gun was or the power she and Kiran possessed. They moved purely on instinct. Confident in their numbers that their prey would go down.
“Kiran,” said Gatril. “We don’t have a choice now…” 
“Do it!” said Kiran, covering his mouth and nose with his shirt.
Gatril inhaled for a big air push and exhaled, spinning as she spread the green mist. The spiders railed in displeasure. Enraged sounds channeling from their mandibles.
Kiran blasted away two of the spiders. “Run to the back of the town!” 
Gatril and Kiran made toward a street. It was walled off by webs—until Gatril melted it with acid. But the further the pair went, the more spiders they saw coming at them. 
Kiran and Gatril had a little more speed as opposed to the spiders burdened by their hard exoskeleton; which they compensated for with the long reach of their spewing webs at the feet of the fleeing duo.
Gatril burned them another passage through the webs, and a third. Kiran used his earth-pillar and made a path over the webs on the ground and the spiders coming from the sides. Gatril took a few shots that popped messy yellow holes in their hides. The spiders screamed and collapsed. Kiran used his force-counter and knocked away three more of the spiders into the side of a house.
Their persistence led them to a path into a thin forest where they found more deceased animals entangled in the webs, and a smell of stale urine and moss assailed their senses like a stealthy, stinky predator.
But in the distance, Kiran and Gatril saw it.
“There’s a cave!” said Gatril, her keen eyesight catching it before the human.
The dark hollow was supplanted into the side of a high mound. Threads stained in yellow split from the mouth and matted around it. The plants were withered as if the threads were robbing them of life, and the pungent smell tripled.
Kiran spun around with his staff, ready. But to his surprise the spiders hesitated. “Look, they stopped.”
Gatril witnessed the once bloodthirsty arachnids stalling, placing their feet forward and back, hesitant as their food was so close, yet so was the abode of the female. 
“Are they afraid of the female?” said Gatril.
“At least they aren’t going to kill us anymore.” Kiran took Gatril’s arm and walked back into the cave, keeping his eyes on the males just in case they mustered enough courage to come closer. 
The sunlight died soon inside, and Kiran felt goosebumps all over him. “We forgot the lantern back on the quacycle,” he said. “Gatril, can you by any chance breathe fire yet?”
“Not naturally like my stomach acid,” she said. “If we had some potassium and glycerin to eat I could though.”
Kiran channeled his spirit energy into his staff. “I guess it’s a good thing I made this spell with Trewanti’s queex.”
Kiran activated his fourth spell from a white orb with blue streaks. Light swelled from it, forming its photons into the shape of an eye. The iris sparkled and a second body of radiance stung the dark out of existence, revealing a rocky ceiling from which twisting roots ran into the walls and floor, all covered in moss. Insects who relished the dark hurried from the scorching light exuding from Kiran’s staff.
“Shall we?” said Kiran.
Gatril shoved Kiran along. “Stop trying to sound all fancy like.”
Kiran and Gatril found two separate, winding paths. The angle making it seem the lumpy walls intended to close and chew them up. The first one they took revealed insects and small rodents who expertly traverse the surface of the web-laden walls and ceiling. It seemed to have been an adaptation, which made Gatril in particular wonder how long the j’bafofi had been here.
The width of the path grew as they went, seeming more befitting of the massive beast fabled to live inside here. Then they reached the end, but contrary to the fangs, claws and beady eyes they were expecting, a mass of corpses piled on top of each other stood at the end, waiting on them like some sick trick.
“Holy crap…” Kiran tried to contain the urge to vomit, triggered by the scent that burnt his lungs. 
“They’re hundreds of them,” said Gatril.
The corpses were a menagerie of humans, beasts and animals, like a deranged necromancer’s collection. The ones at the very bottom were nothing but bones infused with moss and other discoloration over time, while at the top the newcomers still had their skin, though it was shriveled, and with the impact of the moisture had sagged and fused with heat of the others as if they were all trying to become one—souls locked together in an embrace of death. 
Kiran pointed the light above the bodies, where they found a tunnel leading to probably the source of where all these remains came from.
Kiran shuddered as if he could feel multiple hairy legs on him. “It’s like this place is—”
“A dumpster,” Gatril finished. She saw rats scrabbling to the top where others nibbled at the scraps of flesh left. “Come. We should go.”
They went back to the beginning of the fork in the cave and took the other path. This one was larger, very. Big enough to permit an elephant passage. Gatril’s intuition gnawed at her body and she readied her cannon. Kiran drew his knife just for safe measure.
And it came so unsuspectingly that it had the same effect as something leaping out of the dark to bite them. A sweet tune, a hum that came from a throat of liquid crystal. It was soft and reassuring, like the lullabies Kiran’s mother would sing to him.
“What? Who is that?” Kiran wondered if the cave was playing tricks on him. The song was unbefitting of the accursed hole they’d wondered into. It had to be a trap; a siren’s song to lure wary sailors to their doom, as his grandfather would tell Kiran at night when he visited the old man.
And then came an orange glow from around the bed. Faint, flickering, casting jagged shadows on the walls.
“Are you sure we’re in the right place?” said Kiran.
Gatril gestured to the ground briefly. “The webs here are a bit fresh. And now that I know the scent of spiders, it’s like this one’s right under my nose.”
They closer they got the slowler their steps became. But it seemed by the room they found, they had been right to be so cautious in their approach.
A flame burnt in a bronze urn close to the wall, and the essence of freshly sundered wood and mint seeped from it. Thick branches were stuck to the walls of the chamber, holding enough books that seemed to be the humble beginnings of a library. In the corners of the room were trinkets, jewelry that sparkled from the grace of the flames. And in the center, there she was.
It was something humanoid, female in shape, but the body parts composed of jointed limbs and a segmented torso. She had four long arms, each ending in four digits, and her pelvis was squishy looking and pink, contrasting the brown of her chitinous body. The thighs were thick and attached to the outermost of pelvis, from which a long tail hung, tipped with spinnerets. Her six eyes were occupied by a book before, her mandibles clicking thoughtfully as she processed the information, and she briefly brushed back a lock of her black hair with a hand.
But the legs weren’t set in preparation for a lunging attack. The hands weren’t about to wring their necks, and her fangs weren’t dripping neurotoxin in the hindsight of puncturing their flesh. Even when she lifted her head from the book she was reading and spared them a glance, she looked away, only to do a double take as if surprised by who was there instead of the fact that they snuck up upon her.
“Who are you two?” she said, her voice high pitched but grainy.
“My name is Kiran Kehomba,” the boy said. “I’m sorcerer seeking the queex of a j’bafofi. I came here seeking your assistance.”
The six eyes turned to the bosdrake. “And who is this?” the spider said.
“I’m Gatril,” she said. “I’m his friend.”
The spider closed the book, and between her mandibles they could see her lips making a smile. “This is quite the surprise. I was just reading a tale about a human female, falling in love with a beast. To think I’d see something similar even here. The universe must like me.”
Kiran said, “I don’t mean to be rude, mam, but I want to ask you a few questions.”
“You come into my domain, and want to question me?” the spider narrowed her eyes.
Kiran and Gatril’s nerves went array, and their spines wanted out through their backs,
“Shit,” said Gatril. “Quick, Kiran offer to eat her crotch!”
Kiran was a stuttering wreck: “I-I-I-I—”
“Enough!” said Gatril. She approached the spider, flinching when she saw the size of her mandibles. Seven inches. The size of Kiran’s cock. “Now look here!” Gatril pointed, but her finger was too close to the spider’s face and she dropped it. “We just—”
The spider grabbed Gatril by the throat. Gatril tired prying her hand open but the spider’s strength was more than hears, a mighty dragon.
Kiran’s spine suddenly straightened in his back. “Gatril!” He approached the spider. His staff raised with orb for the force-counter pulsing. “Put her down! Please!”
“My,” the spider said, her mandibles salivating. “I’ve never had a dragon before.”
“Bitch!” Gatril squeaked.
“I said drop her!” Kiran boomed.
The spider finally recognized Kiran’s killing intent and payed him heed. She sensed a supernatural force emanating from his staff, and narrowed two of her eyes at him. “You’re a sorcerer…”
“That’s right,” Kiran said, trying his best to contain his rage. “Now put her down before I tear this place down!”
The spider dropped Gatril, not out of fear, but intrigue with the human. Gatril gasped for air and retreated behind Kiran. “You freaky bug! The next time you do that you’ll regret it!”
The spider rose, tendons and chitinous body parts rubbing together like sandpaper. At three meters, she towered over them.
“Human, how many spells do you know?” said the spider.
“Four,” said Kiran. He and Gatril looked at each other with uncertainty. 
“Why would a spider be interested in spells?” said Gatril.
“Isn’t it obvious by what your eyes see?” said the arachnid. “I’ve become enlightened. I no longer thrive on my instincts except to feed to maintain my health.”
“Is that why you haven’t laid any eggs?” said Gatril.
“Yes,” she replied. “I’ve recently stopped accepting offers from the males. They are lowly beasts. Not bright in the head. I’ve sharpened my mind, nourishing it with the knowledge of humans.”  She showed them her hand, conjuring within it a ghostly white energy that danced like a swirling mist.
“That’s…spirit energy,” Kiran said.
The spider closed her hand and the energy vanished. “I’ve grown fond of this power that some humans possess, to point where I managed to discover it in myself. Kiran, if you can teach me about magic, I can give you the queex you want.”
“What?” Gatril turned to Kiran, expecting to see him speechless just like her, but the boy smiling much to her dismay.
“Wow!” said Kiran. “That sounds like a fair trade.”
Gatril grabbed Kiran by the shoulders and quickly walked him back to the mouth of the room. “What are you doing?” Gatril whispered.
“What’s wrong?” said Kiran.
Gatril pinched his lips. She looked over her shoulder at the spider’s six eyes visually ravaging her. Gatril flinched and turn to Kiran. “You can’t teach her magic. You’ve seen what she did to those bodies. Imagine if she starts walking around with a bunch of spells.”
Kiran’s train of thought came an abrupt stop, reversing to take another route that brought him upon a different outcome. “Oh, no,” he said.
“I can hear you, you know,” said the spider.
Kiran and Gatril spun around with innocent smiles. “Umm, you might have misheard,” said Kiran. “We were just talking about how pretty your vagina looks?”
The spider flexed her arms. “You don’t have much of a choice,” she said. “Either teach me about magic and get my queex, or I trap you here until you change your mind. One scream, and all the males will come running in at my side.”
“Then we’ll just have to make this quick,” said Kiran, raising his staff.
The spider flicked her tail and unleashed her webs in an arc. Gatril and Kiran dove out of the way of the silky strands.
Kiran used his force-counter spell, but the j’bafofi leapt into the ceiling. She uttered a high pitched clicking sound that froze Kiran and Gatril.
“Shit!” Gatril said. She opened fire at the spider but the J’bafofi was too fast; scurrying over the surface of the room, spewing more webs that threatened to fill the area. Gatril quickly spat an acidic mist around her that melted the webs, and the j’bafofi seized the opportunity, lunging with a kick that threw Gatril into the wall.
The spider hissed and lunged once more, only to have a column of rock punch her in the stomach. She winced and crumpled, quickly leaping into the ceiling.
Kiran lifted a large rock out of the floor again and launched it with his force-counter. “Got you!” he said.
But the j’bafofi caught the rock and attached it to a thread of silk from her tail. “Thank you,” she sneered.
Kiran felt something heavy drop in his gut when the spider threw the rock at him. Luckily Gatril already got up and dove with Kiran out of the way. The she-spider used the rock and silk like a flail, constantly trying to smashed the human and bosdrake, forcing them all over the room, tripping and kicking over books in their way.
“Kiran!” said Gatril as she ducked beneath the flying rock. “Get me some higher ground!”
“Got it!” said Kiran, tapping the floor and ascended Gatril atop a column. At this height Gatril got a better shot, and managed to put a round in the spider’s shoulder.
The j’bafofi screamed and drop the rock, falling to the floor ground with brute force.
Gatril laughed. “Stay down bitch!”
But unbeknownst to the dragon, a single strand of silk as thick as her pinky had flowed from the spider’s tail and attached to Gatril’s foot. The dragon only found out when the spider yanked her tail and snagged Gatril’s footing from beneath her.
Gatril fell into the j’bafofi’s grasp. The spider held her arms and legs with all of hers. She brought Gatril closer to her impending, salivating fangs. Kiran leaped at the spider with his staff, only to have her tail coil around him.
However, Kiran’s hand with the staff was free, and he looked to the ceiling with epiphany. I hope this works! Kiran thought, and he charged his staff with spirit energy and tossed it into the ceiling.
“I never ate a dragon before,” the spider said with insidious grin behind her fangs.
Gatril bore her teeth in defiance. She tried hawking up some more acid but her stomach’s content had reached its limit. But that proved unnecessary, as Gatril has the pleasure of seeing a huge rock land in the j’bafofi’s head with a solid thonk sound.
The she-spider’s eyes rolled into her head. Her grip loosened and the bosdrake and human quickly stepped away from the beasts as she fell on her knees. 
Kiran took up his staff and said, “Quick, tie her up!”
Gatril used her rifle as a club across the spider’s face, measuring the force so that it didn’t cause further damage, but dealt enough force to knockout her—which it did.
“Bitch!” said Gatril.
Kiran and her quickly bounded the j’bafofi’s six arms and legs together, as well as her tail. They sat her up against the wall, where by the time she regained consciousness she was looking across at Kiran and Gatril who’d seated themselves on some of her books.
“Well look who’s up?” said Gatril, closing a book she had been reading. 
The j’bafofi tried to lunge at Gatril but instantly met with the force of her restraints. “Curses!” The she-spider struggled, but Kiran and Gatril had used a good amount of webbing to tie her that would’ve restrained even a raging bull.
“Save your energy, missy,” said Gatril. “Because we’re going to work you.”
Kiran stood, and said, “Please listen to what we have to say—”
“As if I’d take orders from my food,” said the spider. “Just wait until I get free! I’ll liquefy your organs and drink them like soup!”
“We can free you right now if you cooperate,” said Gatril. 
The j’bafofi for the first time took a keen interest in Gatril. “A drake taking the orders of a human. Did he cast a spell on you?”
“No, I didn’t,” said Kiran. “She can leave or kill me whenever she wants. She just knows the kind of person I am and trusts me.”
The j’bafofi looked at the bosdrake quizzically, then chuckled. “This is a very strange thing indeed. I hear your words human, but I still don’t trust you. What do you want with me?”
“I told you before,” said Kiran. “I just want your queex. Once I get that, I’ll leave you alone. So long as you promise not to eat anymore humans or beasts.”
“Ferrans,” she said. 
“What?” Kiran said.
“We are ferrans,” said the j’bafofi. “We who are not human, but part human and part beast, are not simple-minded creatures. A monster is a mindless force of destruction, and beasts are just smart enough to be a human’s pet. Ferran are those on the same level of intelligence and social development as humans.”
Kiran turned to Gatril, confused and dumbfounded. Gatril herself seemed puzzled too, but she had a knowing air about her.
“Have you heard of this before?” said Kiran. Gatril turned her eyes away, but Kiran had already seen the thoughtful, knowing look in them. “What is it, Gatril?”
“You’re young, Kiran, so you wouldn’t know,” said Gatril. “Some beasts have started to form their own communities, even cities. Those in those places are starting a movement to organize the beasts into their own identity. Ferran comes from the word feral and human; meaning one as powerful as humans, yet untamed by humans.”
“R-Really?” said Kiran. The boy snatched up his bestiary and skipped through the pages. “I know they form clans but nothing as big as that!”
“That’s why I said not to trust books written by just humans,” said Gatril. “Humans have a tendency to permit only what’s beneficial to them to exist. You, spider, what is your name?”
“Shirksire,” she said. 
Gatril said, “Are you from one of these ferran cities, Shirksire?”
“Yes,” Shirksire said. “A long time ago I was exiled because of my belief that humans will never see me as equal. When I found this cave the town soon learned I was hear and tried to kill me. I defended myself—”
Kiran slapped the book shut, startling both women. Kiran put it down and looked at Shirksire testily. “That doesn’t give you the right to kill the entire town.”
“Don’t lecture me on morals, human!” Shirksire barked. “How many ferrans have you killed and skinned, beheaded and boiled down to the bone just to keep as your trophies? I only killed those who entered my cave to kill me. Their weapons are over there in the corner. The males caught wind of me here and did the rest. Besides…I doubt the entire town died. Probably some humans escaped. If the two of you can get past those idiot males, then there’s a good chance they did.”
Gatril turned to Kiran to see what his response would be. She didn’t want to tell him she mostly agreed with Shirksire; that she didn’t see anything wrong with killing and eating humans who came after them. But her interactions with Kiran and previous humans couldn’t fully make her accept the mindless killing of humans without reason.
However, her answer from Kiran was an unexpected one. He got up, took out his knife and began cutting the webs at Shirksire’s feet.
“What are you doing?” said Gatril, getting up with the gun in her hands.
“Showing her forgiveness,” said Kiran as he finished removing the webs from around Shirksire’s feet. “She doesn’t trust humans. But I’ll show her trust—Shirksire.”
The j’bafofi sat patiently while Kiran cut away her restraints. But she still didn’t move, courtesy of the gun aimed at her. When Kiran was finished, he went to Gatril and gestured for her to lower the gun.
“Are you sure about this Kiran?” Gatril said.
“…I haven’t been wrong yet,” said Kiran. He turned to Shirksire. “If you don’t trust me, you should at least trust another ferran…”
Shirksire waited on Gatril, and finally the bosdrake pointed the gun away from the j’bafofi. Shirksire slowly stood, flexing the stiffness out of her limbs. She looked down at the pair and said, “You are foolish for thinking you can make friends out of all your enemies, boy.”
“Are you my enemy?” said Kiran.
Shirksire sighed. “Fine…You win, human.”
Kiran smiled. “In that case…” He quickly pulled down his trouser and underwear and began stroking his penis. “Let’s get started…”
Shirksire flinched and backed away. “S-So soon?”
“What?” said Gatril. “You’ve never seen a penis before?”
Shirksire saw the quickly increasing size of Kiran’s cock and grew uneasy. “The males…they do not have one so…thick…”
Kiran chuckled. “Don’t worry, it won’t do you anything much.” Now Kiran was fully erect and bobbing with the pulsing blood flow.
Still uneasy, Shirksire said, “How would we begin…?”
“On your knees and suck it,” said Gatril. 
“Y-You mean…in my mouth?” said Shirksire.
“Of course.” Gatril approached Shirksire and yanked on one of her arms. “The sooner you do it, the quicker you’ll get use to it. Now come on. This is great trust building.”
Shirksire reluctantly stooped, now eye-level with Kiran. She took his warm member and gently stroked it. “I swear, human. If you ever double-cross me I’ll eat you alive.”
“You’re about to do it anyways,” said Kiran.
Shirksire understood the joke too clearly and bit her lip in embarrassment. “Damn human…”
Shirksire’s mandibles pulled apart and she brought her mouth towards Kiran’s penis. She stuck her tongue out and brushed it against the tip. She licked it and made a funny face that Kiran smiled at. Then Gatril suddenly shoved her by the back of the head and all of Kiran entered her. 
Shirksire chocked and grabbed Kiran.
“Come no now!” said Gatril, repeatedly shoving her head onto the young man’s rod. “Flick your tongue around it and swallow.”
Shirksire did as she was told. Kiran winced and moaned as Shirksire’s tongue startled to get the better of him. Gatril let go of Shirksire’s head, and the she-spider started steadily sucking Kiran, closing her eyes as she got into her rhythm and stuck with it.
Gatril decided to play her part, and got behind the j’bafofi and reached over her thigh for Shirksire’d already slick vagina. As Gatril rubbed her swollen clitoris she began to moan with Kiran, her other hands gripping her thigh as Kiran tightened his hand on her hair.
