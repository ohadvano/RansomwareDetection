Kiran and Gatril spun around with innocent smiles. “Umm, you might have misheard,” said Kiran. “We were just talking about how pretty your vagina looks?”
The spider flexed her arms. “You don’t have much of a choice,” she said. “Either teach me about magic and get my queex, or I trap you here until you change your mind. One scream, and all the males will come running in at my side.”
“Then we’ll just have to make this quick,” said Kiran, raising his staff.
The spider flicked her tail and unleashed her webs in an arc. Gatril and Kiran dove out of the way of the silky strands.
Kiran used his force-counter spell, but the j’bafofi leapt into the ceiling. She uttered a high pitched clicking sound that froze Kiran and Gatril.
“Shit!” Gatril said. She opened fire at the spider but the J’bafofi was too fast; scurrying over the surface of the room, spewing more webs that threatened to fill the area. Gatril quickly spat an acidic mist around her that melted the webs, and the j’bafofi seized the opportunity, lunging with a kick that threw Gatril into the wall.
The spider hissed and lunged once more, only to have a column of rock punch her in the stomach. She winced and crumpled, quickly leaping into the ceiling.
Kiran lifted a large rock out of the floor again and launched it with his force-counter. “Got you!” he said.
But the j’bafofi caught the rock and attached it to a thread of silk from her tail. “Thank you,” she sneered.
Kiran felt something heavy drop in his gut when the spider threw the rock at him. Luckily Gatril already got up and dove with Kiran out of the way. The she-spider used the rock and silk like a flail, constantly trying to smashed the human and bosdrake, forcing them all over the room, tripping and kicking over books in their way.
“Kiran!” said Gatril as she ducked beneath the flying rock. “Get me some higher ground!”
“Got it!” said Kiran, tapping the floor and ascended Gatril atop a column. At this height Gatril got a better shot, and managed to put a round in the spider’s shoulder.
The j’bafofi screamed and drop the rock, falling to the floor ground with brute force.
Gatril laughed. “Stay down bitch!”
But unbeknownst to the dragon, a single strand of silk as thick as her pinky had flowed from the spider’s tail and attached to Gatril’s foot. The dragon only found out when the spider yanked her tail and snagged Gatril’s footing from beneath her.
Gatril fell into the j’bafofi’s grasp. The spider held her arms and legs with all of hers. She brought Gatril closer to her impending, salivating fangs. Kiran leaped at the spider with his staff, only to have her tail coil around him.
However, Kiran’s hand with the staff was free, and he looked to the ceiling with epiphany. I hope this works! Kiran thought, and he charged his staff with spirit energy and tossed it into the ceiling.
“I never ate a dragon before,” the spider said with insidious grin behind her fangs.
Gatril bore her teeth in defiance. She tried hawking up some more acid but her stomach’s content had reached its limit. But that proved unnecessary, as Gatril has the pleasure of seeing a huge rock land in the j’bafofi’s head with a solid thonk sound.
The she-spider’s eyes rolled into her head. Her grip loosened and the bosdrake and human quickly stepped away from the beasts as she fell on her knees. 
Kiran took up his staff and said, “Quick, tie her up!”
Gatril used her rifle as a club across the spider’s face, measuring the force so that it didn’t cause further damage, but dealt enough force to knockout her—which it did.
“Bitch!” said Gatril.
Kiran and her quickly bounded the j’bafofi’s six arms and legs together, as well as her tail. They sat her up against the wall, where by the time she regained consciousness she was looking across at Kiran and Gatril who’d seated themselves on some of her books.
“Well look who’s up?” said Gatril, closing a book she had been reading. 
The j’bafofi tried to lunge at Gatril but instantly met with the force of her restraints. “Curses!” The she-spider struggled, but Kiran and Gatril had used a good amount of webbing to tie her that would’ve restrained even a raging bull.
“Save your energy, missy,” said Gatril. “Because we’re going to work you.”
Kiran stood, and said, “Please listen to what we have to say—”
“As if I’d take orders from my food,” said the spider. “Just wait until I get free! I’ll liquefy your organs and drink them like soup!”
“We can free you right now if you cooperate,” said Gatril. 
The j’bafofi for the first time took a keen interest in Gatril. “A drake taking the orders of a human. Did he cast a spell on you?”
“No, I didn’t,” said Kiran. “She can leave or kill me whenever she wants. She just knows the kind of person I am and trusts me.”
The j’bafofi looked at the bosdrake quizzically, then chuckled. “This is a very strange thing indeed. I hear your words human, but I still don’t trust you. What do you want with me?”
“I told you before,” said Kiran. “I just want your queex. Once I get that, I’ll leave you alone. So long as you promise not to eat anymore humans or beasts.”
“Ferrans,” she said.
