The popobawa reluctantly ingested the semen, grimacing. “That was disgusting.”
Aparna patted her head and kissed her. “That’s karma for you.” She laid the woman onto her back and stooped over her face. “Now, time for round two.”
“That’s right,” said Gatril, also with her bottom over Kiran’s face. “Time for you two to make us feel good.”
“At least my tongue isn’t injured,” said Kiran, giggling along with the other women. The popobawa, though frustrated with its defeat, was at least pleased to know a cock wouldn’t be penetrating her, and as Aparna and Gatril sat, both her and Kiran leisurely began eating out the snatch of the women.
Kiran and the popobawa were experts in their own right, able to maintain a rigid flexibility to their tongues while the women bounced on their faces. Aparna and Gatril increased their pace as they made sensuous moans. Aparna was first to reach her climax, then Gatril.
The popobawa licked the scented liquid off her face, savoring the taste. “You Gabanyese women are spicy.”
Aparna saw a tiny smile on the popobawa’s face. “Thanks for the compliment,” she said.
Getting up, Gatril said, “Sounds like someone’s enjoying themselves. In that case…” Gatril gestured for Aparna to get off the popobawa, and the bosdrake cut her restraints with a claw. She helped her to her feet and motioned to Kiran. “Why don’t you finish things off for us.”
The popobawa saw Kiran looking at her expectantly, stroking his still rigid cock with one hand. He smiled at her. She made a frown, but Kiran could tell it was forced. “Why don’t you come over here and…have a seat.”
The popobawa smirked. “None of you tell anyone about this.”
“My lips are sealed,” said Gatril. She turned and kissed Aparna—stuck her fingers inside her. “Let’s cuddle.”
The popobawa crawled over Kiran. She kissed him on his lips, his chin, his neck. With one hand she steadied his penis and slowly sat on it. She moaned softly at the pressure against her insides at the size that filled her. “…Boy…you have a gift it seems.”
Kiran held on her waist with his one hand, while she pressed against his chest. The popobawa started out with slow motions of with her hips. She leaned over Kiran and offered her breasts to him, and happily obliging, the boy sucked on each of them. 
The popobawa chuckled and held him close. Their love sounds filled the nest, with Aparna and Gatril watching from the other side. Once the popobawa felt Kiran’s grip tighten on her flesh she knew what was coming. She clenched her muscles and held him in place as Kiran’s warm juices flooded inside her. The popobawa closed her eyes and as the hot fluid nestled inside her, her flesh willingly absorbing everything he had to offer.
“Wow,” said Gatril. “That was…”
“Sensual,” said Aparna.
“Well,” Gatril said, “I was thinking more of, fricking aces!”

Kiran got some more rest, though a beast such as the popobawa, who called herself Trewanti, was already beginning to recover from the non-lethal wound. While Aparna went back to the inn to fetch Kiran some more supplies, Gatril and Trewanti got wet clothes and wiped down Kiran, also giving him mint sticks to remove the smell of crotch from his breath.
Trewanti kept any thoughts or opinions behind her sealed lips most of the time, raising both Kiran’s and Gatril’s interest. After they’d put on back his shorts, Kiran said, “Trewanti…”
“Yes?” the woman sat on the ground and crossed her legs. She was still naked, still in her humanoid skin. 
“So, what will you do now?” said Kiran.
Trewanti smiled with a playful charm. “I’m still a popobawa. I need to feed.on blood, and I still possess my urge for intercourse, especially with beasts and humans anally.”
Kiran sighed, and said, “Do you think could not feed on humans or beasts, just animals? I wouldn’t want to have to confront you like this again.”
“Ai,” said Trewanti, “you humans and your demands. Always acting like you have the right to everything.”
“The request is fair enough,” said Gatril, folding her arms. “Just stop killing and raping humans and beasts.”
Trewanti returned a contemptuous gaze at Gatril, and said, “Is that how he got you? He beat you up, captured you and force you to suck his cock?”
“Nope,” said Gatril, “I actually captured him when he tried to. I just so happen to have taken a liking to him and let him mount me.”
Kiran laid an annoyed scowl upon Gatril. “No one needed to know that?”
“And you believe they don’t think that?” said Gatril. She turned to Trewanti. “He’s my sex companion.”
“I’m a sorcerer too,” said Kiran assertively. “I’m on my way to enter the Witching Tournament. The last thing on my list is a j’bafofi.”
Gatril saw the chink in Trewanti’s smile and said, “What, you don’t think he can do it?”
“I never said that,” said Trewanti. “I’m just wondering how’ll he’ll deal with the competition.”
“What are you talking about?” Kiran’s displeasure lead him to ignore his discomfort and sit up. 
“I take it you mean the female j’bafofi,” said Trewanti. “In that case, she always has many of her males trying to impress her with the sole intent of planting their seeds inside her. If they fail, she simply eats them.”
