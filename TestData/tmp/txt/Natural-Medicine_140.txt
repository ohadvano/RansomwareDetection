Smoking is an exceedingly acid-producing habit; and one of the major roles of calcium in

the body is to maintain a proper acid-alkaline balance. When one smokes, the calcium is

actual y drained from the bones and teeth to meet this need. Alcohol impairs calcium

absorption by affecting the liver's ability to activate vitamin D, which is important in the

metabolism of calcium.

Caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, soft drinks, hot chocolate, and many over-

the-counter drugs, causes more calcium to be excreted from the body than is normal(8).

The more salt (in particular, the more sodium) you take in, the more calcium you excrete.

Some antacids contain aluminum, which causes an increase in calcium excretion. It has

been clearly shown that exercise increases bone mass, while lack of exercise causes

bone loss. Since Vitamin D plays an important role in bone metabolism and the best

source of vitamin D is sunshine, it stands to reason that a lack of sunshine can lead to

osteoporosis.

When the problem of osteoporosis is studied world-wide, one is struck with the fact

that the highest incidence of osteoporosis is in countries where dairy products and calcium

supplements are consumed in the greatest quantities. The incidence of osteoporosis is

lowest in the countries where the least amount of dairy products are consumed, such as

the African countries. A number of studies have been done among the Bantu women of

Africa. They consume less than half the protein of Americans, and have a life-style

demanding large amounts of calcium (nursing up to ten children in a lifetime), yet

osteoporosis is almost unknown among them.

NATURAL SOLUTIONS



Let us cut down on the amount of protein we eat each day, and eat foods high in

natural calcium. For good health we must eat our food in as natural a state as possible

without taking man-made supplements.

CALCIUM SUPPLEMENT CONTAMINANTS



Those taking calcium supplements in an attempt to prevent osteoporosis may be

consuming toxic trace metal contaminants. An analysis of samples of dolomite from a

manganese, selenium, and zinc(10).

PROSTATE GLAND

The prostate gland is red-brown in color and about the size of an English walnut. It is

located immediately under the bladder and in front of the rectum. It has three lobes, or

sections, enclosed side by side in a capsule. The urinary tube from the bladder passes

over the middle lobe; anything that happens there to swel the prostate- infection,

inflammation, cancer, etc., can enlarge these lobes and thus obstruct the flow of urine.

The prostate gland is the principal storage depot for seminal fluid. At each sexual

encounter the testicles provide over 200 mil ion sperm cel s. The function of the prostate is

to produce lubricating fluids and a special activating fluid in sexual activity that wil dilute

the sperm cel s. This seminal fluid is very high in zinc and also contains proteins,

enzymes, fats and sugars to nourish the sperm. It is alkaline to overcome the acidity of the

female tract and it is a very watery medium in which the sperm can swim toward the

female egg.

More zinc is found in the prostate gland than any other organ in the body. Zinc is a

trace mineral needed in only very smal amounts, but a deficiency can lead to major

medical problems. Zinc is found in high concentration in sperm and seminal fluid. The

brain also must have adequate zinc in order to keep the thoughts organized and balanced.

Excessive sexual practice may lead to depletion of zinc stores which may be fol owed by

both prostate disease and neurologic and mental disorders. Al nerve tissue is also

dependent for proper functioning on this trace mineral.

Each day the prostate produces from 1/10 to 2/5 of a teaspoon of seminal fluid.

During sexual arousal four to ten times that amount is produced. The prostate also

becomes congested with blood during arousal. An overactive sexual life can cause

chronic congestion in the prostate. Over a long period of lime, the prostate yields to the

constant pressure, enlarging to make room for the extra blood and seminal fluid.

There is a higher rate of cancer of the prostate among blacks â€” two times that of

Caucasians and four times that of Asians. Medical researchers and social scientists have

postulated that their often higher incidence of sexual activity may have led to this increase

in prostate problems. Male hormones increase with sexual excitation. The male hormone

testosterone breaks down to dihydrotestosterone. It is known that this substance, at least

in some laboratory animals, can cause the prostate to enlarge. The male hormones seem

to be a major cause of prostate enlargement as prostate enlargement rarely occurs

among eunuchs.

Enlargement of the prostate can be detected during a rectal examination (in which

the physician inserts a gloved finger into the rectum). If the doctor's examining finger

discovers a hard, button-size nodule in the otherwise soft, rubbery tissue, he considers it

cancer until he has proved otherwise. (Three times out of five, it is cancer).

Symptoms of an enlarged prostate usual y develop gradual y, as the enlarging

prostate compresses and distorts the urethra, (urinary tube). The flow of urine is

constricted, and there is difficulty starting urination and a weak stream. If the prostate

becomes too enlarged it wil actual y close off the urinary tube completely. In extreme

cases the prostate can become as large as a grapefruit. This enlargement can be either

cancerous or benign, but is usual y cancerous.

Cancer of the prostate is the second most common cancer in men. It sometimes

develops in middle age, but most often occurs in the elderly. Most cancers of the prostate

are very slow growing and usual y the person wil die of some other disease such as heart



162

attack, stroke, diabetes, etc., before they would die of prostate cancer. Recent studies

suggest that if every case of prostate cancer were treated in its earliest stages, more men

would die of surgical complications than the disease itself.



DIET ATTECTS THE PROSTATE

It is of interest that diet is not usual y mentioned as a cause of cancer of the

prostate. Yet it is cited as very important in a 20 year study done by Dr. Roland Phil ips at

Loma Linda, California. The study showed that fatal prostate cancer was more common

depending on the frequency with which meat, milk, eggs and cheese were used in the

diet. As each one of these food substances was added to the diet, the risk increased.

(Journal of Epidemiology 120(2):244) Cancer of the prostate is substantial y less among

Seventh-Day Adventists who use no coffee, alcohol and little or no animal products.

(Cancer Research, 43:2403, May 1983) Persons with any kind of prostate problems must

make sure they are drinking plenty of water so that the urine is almost clear. They should

also be on a diet of mostly raw foods.



FOOD THAT IRRITATE THE PROSTATE

Alcohol, animal products, caffeine, and spices should be eliminated from the diet of

those who have prostate problems. Animal products should be removed from the diet

because of the purine content which tends to increase the irritability of the bladder which

can indirectly affect the prostate gland. Caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, colas and

chocolate is an irritant to the urinary tract. It has been shown that just one cup of coffee

per day can cause 2 1/2 times greater incidence of cancer of the bladder. Spices also

have a tendency to irritate the prostate and bladder and should be removed from the diet.



NUTRITIONAL TREATMENT VS. CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT

The primary conventional treatments administered for enlarged prostate are

catheter drainage, estrogenic hormones, prostatic massage, and of course, closed

transurethral prostatic resection or, alternatively, removal of the prostate. Unfortunately,

doctors (and patients) have found surgery to be a radical remedy to this*" common

affliction, often resulting in complications. More and more patients are opting for a safer

cure.

Because of its nontraumatic, natural way the nutritional approach is preferable to

the more orthodox procedures.



For Prostate Enlargement Use Saw Palmetto Berries and Zinc



Enlarged prostate responds wel to the herb saw palmetto berries. Saw Palmetto is

a smal palm tree native to the West Indies and the Atlantic Coast of North America

extending from North Carolina to Florida. The trees are crowned with large, two to four-

foot high spiny-toothed leaves which form a circular, fan-shaped outline.

The plant's deep red-brown to black berries are wrinkled, oblong, and 0.5 to 1 - inch

in length with a diameter of 0.5 inch. They contain about 1.5 percent of a fruity smel ing oil

loaded with the sterol betasitosterol and its glu-coside, plus the saturated and unsaturated

fatty acids of captric, caprylic, caproic, lauric, palmitic, and ol eic. These fatty acids

comprise 63% of the oil, with the remaining portion consisting of their ethyl esters and the

mentioned sterols. Also present are carotenes, lipase, tannins and sugars.

Serenoa Repens (Saw Palmetto berries) has been found to be extremely effective

in treating prostate enlargement, according to a study by Dr. G. Champault published in

the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. Serenoa works by countering the effect of



163

decreased testosterone in your system, (which al ows other hormones, including DHT, to

increase the size of the prostate.) Dr. C. Sultan, in a study published in the Journal of

Steroid Biochemistry, found that Serenoa contains sterol like compounds that inhibit the

formation of DHT. This nutrient comes from a berry produced by a palm species common

to the Southeast United States. American Indians felt it was a cure for prostate problems.

European scientists have confirmed these effects in 12 major scientific studies done over

the past twenty years.

Prostate disorders are much more common in developed countries, such as the

United States, than in Third World countries. There are a few reasons why. The primary

one is that the majority of American meals are overcooked or over processed. The

processing of food destroys a good portion, if not al , of one of the most important

nutrients used by the prostate gland - zinc.



The Prostate Needs 10 Times More Zinc Than Any Other Organ



Most of the zinc in food is lost in processing, or never exists in a substantial amount

due to nutrient poor soil. Zinc is not normal y replaced in the soil when chemical fertilizers

are used. The world famous founder of the free radical theory of aging, Dr. Denham

Harman, M.D., Ph.D. professor emeritus of the University of Nebraska School of Medicine,

stated, "Some 90% of the population consumes diets deficient in zinc."

The prostate uses 10 times more of this nutrient than any other organ in the body.

As the production of testosterone declines, an enzyme stimulates the production of DHT

and other hormones which cause enlargement. Many scientists have confirmed that when

sufficient zinc is present, it helps prevent that enzyme from doing its damage.



Dr. M. S. Fahin and Dr. H. A. Essa published a clinical study in a government

medical journal showing that treatment with zinc reduces prostate enlargement. Dr.

Geoffrey Crisholin and Dr. Alan Leake reported in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry that

zinc prevents the hormonal actions that causes prostate enlargement. In total, fifteen

prominent research scientists published confirming reports that sufficient zinc is of vital

necessity for having a healthy prostate gland. Significant quantities of zinc are found in

brewerâ€™s yeast, lima beans, pecans, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and soybeans.

Smal er amounts of zinc are found in legumes and whole grains.



Hydrotherapy and Massage Will Help Reduce the Enlarged Prostate Gland



Hot and cold sitz baths alternating, using 3 minutes hot and one minute cold, are

beneficial for an enlarged prostate gland. You always start with the hot and end with the

cold. This combination can be done from 3 to 5 times, and should be done once or twice a

day. Massage of the prostate (through the rectum) can help reduce the swel ing and help

in the recovery of an enlarged prostate.

Prostate problems very rarely occur before the age of 30. At the age of 50 there wil

be a 25 percent chance of an enlarged prostate. At the age of 60 about half of al men wil

have developed some enlargement of the prostate. At the age of 80 almost al men wil

have some enlargement.



PROSTATE CANCER FACTS



Despite a major hoopla over the new Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test,

concurrent biopsies and early aggressive treatment for prostate cancer, the best treatment

for most men is no treatment at all. Here are the facts:



164



â€¢ Most cases of cancer of the prostate are so slow growing that they rarely become

life threatening.

â€¢ For men who are under 70, early detection and radical treatment may increase life

by less than one year, but complications are too severe to warrant prostatectomy

(removal of the prostate).

â€¢ Approximately one in 380 men with prostate cancer wil die of the disease.

â€¢ In a major study from Sweden, men of median age 72 were fol owed over ten

years. Al had prostate cancer. After ten years, the cancer death rate was 8.5% for

those men who received no treatment. The cancer death rate for American men

who are treated aggressively (PSA testing, drugs and prostatectomy) is 15%.

â€¢ The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute have long

advocated yearly rectal exams for men over 40. This screening is now being

escalated to recommendation for PSA blood test for men over 50. Both these tests

are absolutely meaningless, given the new results of testing. There is no reason for

early prostate cancer when the optimum treatment is no treatment at al .

â€¢ The PSA test is a poor test. More than one-third of al men with prostate cancer wil

have normal PSA test. The rate of positive test for men with no cancer is even

higher.

â€¢ The positive PSA tests foster lots of biopsies to test further for prostate cancer.

When biopsies are positive, many if not most doctors wil opt for a radical

prostatectomy. The risks of this procedure are severe. Within a month, 8% of men

wil suffer cardiovascular complications and 2% wil die. Impotence, bladder

problems and bowel obstruction are not uncommon.

â€¢ Dr. Frank Hinman, Jr. of the University of California, San Francisco School of

Medicine, observes that mass screening of prostate cancer in elderly men may

have more risks than benefits.



While 2.5% of men die of prostate cancer, the greatest proportion of men screened

for prostate cancer may be subjected to unnecessary stress and anxiety, expensive

diagnostic testing and unnecessary treatment. (Internal Medicine News 24(21)52,

November 1-14, 1991)

SUGAR AND HONEY



In 1882, the average American ate 2 teaspoons of sugar per day. In 1870, it was 11

teaspoons per day. In 1980, we consumed 35 teaspoons of sugar per day; and now the

average is over 42 teaspoons per day. (See chart on Sugar Content of some popular

foods).



WHAT IS SUGAR?

Sugar is a carbohydrate that occurs natural y in various forms in al living things. In

its natural form, sugar, as found in the sugar cane or sugar beet, is combined with a large

amount of fiber, and also contains iron, potassium, calcium, B vitamins, etc.. These

nutrients are needed to digest the sugar that is in the sugar beet or sugar cane, However

white sugar, as we get it today, has been robbed of almost 100% of these nutrients. White

sugar is so pure and refined that it basical y has nothing in it but 'empty calories'.

Concentrated, pure sugar is a drug, unrelated to anything that occurs natural y, and

is very harmful to your body. According to John Yudlin, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Nutririon

at London University, "If only a smal fraction of what is known about the effects of sugar

was revealed in relation to any other food additive, that material would be promptly

banned".

Sugar throws off the calcium-phosphorous balance, and disrupts the entire

important phase of your body machinery. Because refined sugar has been robbed of the B

vitamins that are necessary for its assimilation by the body, it latches on to these wherever

it finds them - namely, in your digestive tract, so that the person who eats refined sugar is

bound to be short on the B vitamins. Result? Nervousness, skin troubles, digestive

trouble, and a host of other disorders which lead to much more serious problems later on.

The more sugar you eat, the lower your body's resistance to disease becomes. To

have good health we must have a strong immune system. Sugar lowers our body's

immune system, making it weak instead of strong. In our body we have white blood cel s,

which are cal ed warrior cel s. These attack and destroy bacteria. However, when we eat

refined sugar, it causes our white blood cel s to become sluggish, causing them to lose

their ability to destroy as many bacteria.

In a healthy body, where no refined sugar is eaten, one white blood cel can destroy

14 bacteria. If a person then eats 12 teaspoons of sugar (a 12 oz. bottle of Cola has 10

teaspoons), one of their white blood cel s wil only be able to destroy 5.5 bacteria. If a

person eats 24 teaspoons of sugar (a banana split has 25 teaspoons of sugar), one of

their white blood cel s wil only be able to destroy 1 bacteria. This weakening effect on the

white blood cel usual y lasts for approximately 5 hours. To keep our body's immune

system strong, we must leave sugar alone.



Refined sugar drains out the mineral salts of the blood, bones, and tissues. It

causes hyperactivity and dental caries. It causes obesity, diabetes, low blood sugar, high

blood pressure, duodenal ulcers, fatty livers, coronary and vascular disease, gout,

dermatitis, and cancer. According to the American Journal of Hypertension (3:560-562,

1990), sucrose (sugar) intake may increase the blood pressure. Other studies have

indicated that the intake of refined carbohydrates produces an increase in the blood

pressure.

WHAT ABOUT HONEY?



Honey is not a disaccharide like sugar; it is a

monosaccharide which does not over-stimulate the

pancreas. Sugar, which comes from beets or cane, is

sucrose, a disaccharide, which over-stimulates the

pancreas. Sugar also must undergo digestion, a process

that changes it into simple sugar; whereas, honey is pre-

digested and takes a load of work off the stomach and

pancreas.



Honey is refined by the bees, whereas sugar is

refined by man under less than ideal conditions, for man is

not as careful or as diligent as the honey bee. Bees have to

col ect nectar from nearly two mil ion flower blossoms to

produce just one pound of honey. Bees are faithful and

diligent in their work of making honey. Of course, pure

organic raw honey is better than what you buy at the local



167

grocery store. Raw honey wil in a short time crystal ize because it has not been heated to

a high temperature and had al the enzymes destroyed. Honey also has more vitamins

and minerals than sugar. (See chart for comparison)
