I nod in understanding. “Okay.”
“Do you want me to wait for you here?”
She's most likely really tired from work so I shake my head. “No, it's okay, go home and rest.”
“I'll see you at home.” She waves and leaves.
I wave back, walk up the steps and into the school. The doors are surprisingly still open at this hour, maybe a few teachers are still here doing last minute preparations for tomorrow.
I walk leisurely down the corridors and eventually arrive at Sam's locker. I grab onto the lock and enter Sam's combination code into it and the latch easily opens. The day we became best friends was also the day Sam and I gave each other's combination code. The reason why we did this was that if we needed anything from each other's lockers, we could always help ourselves.
I look inside Sam's locker in search for her keys but come up empty handed. I check again to make sure that they're there but her keys are nowhere to be found. I close the locker and turn to leave when I see what appears to be a single light ignited in a classroom.
With light footsteps, I draw nearer to the classroom and open the door when I notice that this classroom is familiar.
Who could be here at this hour?
I jerk in surprise when a voice brings me to attention.
“Looking for these?” Sitting in his chair holding a chain of keys on the end of his finger is Mr Edmund.
I peer at the keys he holds. “Are those...Sam's keys?” “Indeed.” He sighs “Kids these days, so irresponsible.”
I frown, confused on why he has her keys. “Why do you have her keys?”
“They merely came into my reach.” He twirls the keys around his fingers and stands. “I presume that you're here to collect them?”
“That's right...”
He stands in front of me and gives me the keys. “How is Sam?” Even though he's asking about her, he looks as though he doesn't care at all.
I snarl. “She's unconscious sir, whoever hit her, hit her pretty hard.”
He turns his back on me. “How awful. You must be worried for your friend.”
“You have no idea. This week hasn't been the best of weeks.”
He looks back at me with a malicious grin. “That I can understand.”
With the keys in my hand, I turn to leave when he calls my name.
“Yes?”
“Tell me, Alice. How do you manage to live life without your father in it?”
What the..?
“Excuse me?”
“I've read your school records, and I was quite surprised by it. We have something in common you and I.”
“We do...?”
He points to himself. “I too haven't met someone who should've been a part of my life, but wasn't.”
Why is he talking with me about this? “Have you never met your father too?”
“No, my son actually, I haven't seen him nineteen years.” He sits down at his desk and takes a book from a drawer. I
notice it's the book we were given today in class.
He has a son?
“Did you have a chance to read this book, Alice?”
I shake my head, shock still registering in my brain. “I read the first couple of chapters and it seems like a very interesting story.”
He looks at the cover in fascination. “This book is one of my favourites.” He turns the book over in his hands and stares at the cover. “You see, this story is about a man who fell in love with this woman from overseas. The man spent months in that country and eventually fell in love with it. One day at a nearby cafe, he noticed this beautiful woman sitting alone reading a book, and he kept asking himself while he was looking at the woman if he had the courage to approach and talk to her. As he was doing that, the woman unexpectedly turned his way and smiled at him, and he felt that was enough of a reason to go to her.” He puts the book down and stares at me. “They were inseparable after that, spent days and nights together and even talked about having a future together, but she knew one day he would have to leave and go back to his own country. When that day came, she surprised him by saying that she would leave with him, and they left together.
Years went by, they got married and even talked about having children. They tried and tried until they were gifted with a beautiful baby boy.” He clears his throat. “But things started to fall apart after that for the man and woman, they started to drift apart. To cut a long story short, she fell in love with another man, who already had a wife and a child. A beautiful baby girl. The father of the girl ran away with the man's wife, taking along her son with them. The man never saw his son again, and the father never saw his daughter again.”
“Do you know what happens next in the book?”
He sighs. “That I do not, I've never read this book before.” He picks up the book and throws it in the bin placed next to the desk.
What?
“Then, what were you just talking about?” I have no idea what's going on.
“I was telling you about my life story, sad isn't it?” He stares intensely at me.
I look around, avoiding eye contact with him. “I don't know what you want me to do with this new information.”
He shrugs. “Do with it what you will.”
There's one thing I am curious about though. If Mr Edmund was the man with the son, who was the man with the daughter?
“Ask me the question you want to be answered, Alice.”
I look back at him, he grins at me. “Who was the man with the daughter.”
He chuckles. “Can you really not guess? Surely you know the answer to that.”
Why do I feel like it's related to me?
He nods. “Your father fell in love with my wife, and he left you and your mother to raise my son.” He emphasizes my.
I hear my heart beating in my throat. “No...”
“Yes, yes, yes!” He slams the desk with every yes. “Did you ever wonder where he was all these years? He's been overseas raising my son like his own, but can you imagine how happy I was when I learned that the man who took the woman I loved away from me had a daughter, in this very school.”
My eyes start to water. “I've got nothing to do with this. I hate my father for leaving me and my mother.”
He looks at me in pity. “He took away something from me Alice, and now I'm taking something away from him.” He stands from his chair.
I tremble from my position in the door and watch as Mr Edmund starts to breathe heavily when the sound of bones stretches the silence in the classroom. His jaw suddenly dislocates and develops into a vicious fanged mouth and soon after, his entire face structure transformers into a wolf, when hair starts to appear all over his body, I gasp in horror when I see that his eyes have turned blood red.
I whimper in absolute fright when it suddenly occurs to me that the colour of this wolf's fur looks oddly familiar - the dull shade of grey with big chunks of the fur missing, and the scars on its entire body. I feel like screaming when I realize that this wolf was the one that bit me the night of the full moon.
This all happened because of him.
When the wolf starts to prowl closer to me I know exactly what its intent is. I run out of the classroom door and down the corridor when the wolf lets out an ear bursting howl behind me, causing my heart to beat rapidly inside my chest. I exit out of the school with Sam's keys in my hands and run to the only car left in the lot. I manage to pick the right key and unlock the car in record speed. I see the wolf run out the doors of the school just as I close the door.
I turn on the ignition, drive away from the school and start to head home, breaking every speed limit along the way.
It takes me half an hour to drive home, and when it comes into view, I let out a sigh of relief. I stop the car and rest my head against the steering wheel. I stay in that position for a few minutes to steady my heart and breathing.
I turn my head to look at the house and notice that the front door has been left open.
Why would my mother leave the door wide open?
I exit the car and run to the doorway but stop when I see the house in complete disarray.
“Mum?”
I wait for her response but not even a sound is to be heard inside the house. I check outside to see if her car is there and frown when I see her car parked in the driveway.
Where did she go?
I worryingly walk inside the house and enter the living area when I suddenly slide on something on the floor. I lower my head and immediately start to feel nauseous when I see a trail of footprints covered in blood, leading out into the garden, additionally I start to think the worst.
“Mum!?” I yell.
With my heart beating inside my ears, I run to the door leading to the garden with trembling legs and let out a bloodcurdling scream.
“No.” I repeat to myself while shaking my head.
My eyes glisten with tears when I stare at a body floating face down in the swimming pool. The colour of the water no longer blue, but the colour red.
I pray that this isn't who I think it is, but something tells me that I know exactly who's lying in the pool.
With unsteady feet, I drag my feet closer to the pool - my heart breaking with every step I take.
Crouching at the pool's edge where the body floats nearer to me, I reach to pull the body out of the water and notice by the colour of her hair and the clothes that she wore to work this morning, that this is the person that brought me into this world.
With all the strength I have, I pull her out of the water and rest her gently on my thighs.
As I look at her, lying motionless in my arms, there's only this numb feeling inside of me.
Why would someone want to do this to my mother?
My mother, who was a good and kind person to others around her, a person who hasn't had the best life, raising me all on her own without a father, I wouldn't have been the person that I am right now if it wasn't for her.
I lean over her with trembling lips, kiss her gently on her cheek and rock her lightly in my arms, while the tears continue to fall.
Recognition filters on my mind, that the person I love the most in this world, has been taken away from me forever, and all I can do is scream.

Chapter 1

Tonight hasn't been so bad. I mean, you have good days and bad days, right? Sundays are usually quiet around here but it's not so bad really.
The regulars are kind and generous with their tips, and even my boss Robbie isn't so bad. He's a little on the lazy side and stares a little too long at my backside, but he always pays on time and lets me take any leftover food home with me.
I look up at the old round clock hung up on the wall and sigh in contempt.
Only half an hour to go.
I stare at the last customer of the night and pray silently that he's close to finishing. I grab the coffee pot, walk with a forced smile and approach the customer.
“More coffee, sir?” I plead with my eyes in the hope that he would say no.
“No, thank you, my dear.” He says as he stands from the table.
I help him put on his coat and grab his umbrella. He hands me a ten-pound note and walks out the door without a word. I put the money in the till and turn off the lights in the diner.
Afterwards, I head towards the back of the diner where the kitchen is, and realize it's only me and Terry left. He's looking at the schedule hanging up on the office wall with a look of dread on his face. Terry sighs loudly when he looks at the dates he's working. Terry's worked at the diner for over thirty years and not once has he had a day off. His hair is starting to gray, but he can cook the most delicious food I've ever had the pleasure of tasting.
“Hey Terry, the last customer just left. Do you want me to lock up the diner for you?”
Terry waves at me but doesn't look away from the schedule, “I'll lock up the front but could you do me a favor before you leave, dear?”
Before I could respond to say anything, Terry gathers six plastic bags full of trash, and drops them at my feet.
“You want me to take these out to the dumpster?” I ask as I gather all six bags, three in each hand, and look up at Terry.
“Please, I would really appreciate it.” He grabs his jacket, waves, and leaves.
I stare at the swinging door dumbfounded and shake my head.
With the bags still in my hands, I leave through the back and walk towards the dumpster. I scoff when I see that it's pouring down with rain.
Great. Thanks, Terry. Thanks a bunch.
I push open the top of the dumpster, and grab the first two bags to throw in when from the darkness behind me, I hear the faint unmistakable sound of growling. I freeze, wondering if that was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Terrified, I clutch the bags close and turn around, holding the bags as one would a sword, ready to strike out. I turn, and as I open my eyes, I see the source of the growling, as standing not two meters away is the largest wolf I've ever seen.
I whimper in fright, and slowly start to retreat backwards, dropping my makeshift weapon as I go. I feel my back touch the dumpster, and realize there's nowhere for me to go. Shaking in fear, I close my eyes, praying the wolf doesn't see me as a threat or worse, a meal.
“Please don't hurt me.” I whisper repeatedly to myself. I open my eyes and wish that I hadn't.
Its eyes will haunt me for as long as I live. The eyes were blood-red, filled with pure hatred towards me. A dull shade of gray covers its whole body with big chunks of its fur missing, like it had been ripped off. The wolf looked as though it had scars everywhere on its body. How had it managed to survive this long?
I do the only thing I can think of. I kneel down on the wet floor with my head bowed down in the hope it's a sign of submission. The wolf howls into the night and lunges for me. I scream as it tackles me but soon runs into the bushes and out of sight. I look in the direction the wolf ran and start laughing hysterically.
What the fuck	?
I shake my head and pick myself off the floor, my uniform completely ruined. I check myself over, and that's when I notice on my right shoulder that my clothing's been torn apart.
Why does my shoulder hurt so much?
It looked as though something had taken a chunk out of my shirt.
“Ouch!” I wince, and as I touch my shoulder, I see red liquid coating the skin on my hand.
Blood! Did it bite me!?
I look around, trying to figure out whether that really happened.
Shaken, I chuck the last few bags in the dumpster, grab my bag, lock up and head home.
As I walk home in the dark, the rain no longer pouring, I look up into the night sky, and notice the full moon.
Chapter 2

When I arrive at school the next morning, all I can think about is last night. I woke up early to check if it actually happened, and knew that it did when I saw the bite marks. As a result, I couldn't sleep. At all. Sleeping on my right side hurt too much, and school was by far the last place I wanted to be.
I walk to my locker, grab my English book, and that's when I hear my best friend calling my name from the other end of the corridor.
“Alice! Did you watch Game of Thrones last night!?” One thing about Sam is that she doesn't give a damn about what anyone thinks of her. Me? I worry way too much about what people think.
When Sam reaches my locker, she places her hands on her hips and tilts her head for an answer I have yet to give. “So, did you watch it?”
I shake my head, “No... I missed it.”
“You what!? How did you miss it!? You do realize it was the finale right!”' She shrieks hysterically at me.
“Sam.” I use my hand to signal her to lower her voice. “Everyone's staring.”
“You think I care about what people think?”
She didn't give me a chance to answer. Instead, she turns around and faces all the onlookers. “Didn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to stare? My mum always tells me to never stare at anybody because if you do, some people might not be as nice as I'm going to be.”
She turns around and shrugs at me when she sees the pure shock on my face. “I told you, I don't give a damn about what people think.”
I look inside my bag to see if I have everything only to realize that I don't have my pencil case. I reopen my locker when I hear Sam sigh.
“People still staring?”
“What? Oh, no just Ryder and his crew. They walk around here like they own the place, but seriously how does a guy even look that good?”
After I grab my pencil case, I shut my locker and look at my best friend, whose mouth is wide open.
“Sam! You're staring honey, and drooling.” I close her mouth, shove the pencil case in my bag and stare at them. Every single person moves to the side to make room for them to pass. You see, this gang does practically own the school, and if you hurt one of them, you hurt them all.
Everyone knows who they are and no one dares to try and talk to them or to even approach them. They walk side by side in a perfect line. Bane and Silver on the outside, with Kellan and Ryder in the middle.
Bane looks to be the most frightening one out of them all. He has an oval shaped face with small, blue piercing eyes. His mouth, full and firm with a constant sneer on his face. He has tanned skin with a warm, golden brown tint that accentuates his large muscular frame. His hair was thick, black and slicked down with both sides of his head shaved. Bane also had a black bushy beard decorating his face. It was hard sometimes to take him seriously with the beard because it kind of makes him look like a big old teddy bear, but if the rumors were true, you definitely shouldn't say that to his face, not unless you wanted to end up in A&E. He wears a plain white wife-beater that's low enough to show the hairs on his chest, and a long black necklace rests on his chest that looks like a triskelion. He wears black tight jeans with black ankle boots with a small heel.
I look over at Silver who walks on the far right corner and just blatantly stare at her. Every girl wants to be her, and every guy in this school wants to date her, but everyone knows that she's in love with Ryder. The way she looks and smiles at him with her perfect teeth and her perfect body. She has a heart-shaped face with pale, smooth skin and bright blue eyes. Her mouth is full and perfectly shaped which helps accentuates her pouty lips. Her long wild, black untamed hair rests on her left shoulder and hangs down by her waist. Her build small but muscular.
Rumours say that she kicked a jocks ass once after he slapped her ass. He left in an ambulance, and didn't return to school until the next month. No one ever touched her again. Not after that. She wears a black leather jacket that cuts to her waist, plain black shorts, and black thigh high boots.
The kindest looking one out of them all is Kellan. It seems kinda odd to see him with these people. He has an oval shaped face with creamy fair skin, dark brown eyes that look haunted but yet gentle at the same time. His face holds no expression which makes it hard to determine whether he's happy or sad. Curly brown hair frames his perfectly shaped face. He wears a black stretcher in his left ear with both of his arms covered in colourful art. His body slim with no ounce of body fat, just pure muscle. He wears a plain black wife - beater, tight black jeans and black sneakers. Kellan just might be the only approachable one out of them all. He has this kind aura about him that draws people in, and it makes it impossible to dislike him. I remember when he and his girlfriend were together. Anna was one of the sweetest girls in this school, and every single person here respected her and treated her with the utmost kindness, but Kellan lost the love of his life over a year ago. Her body was found by the river near the creek in the early hours of the morning.
People say that the crime scene was like something out of a horror film. Nevertheless, Kellan lost a part of himself after losing Anna, and I didn't blame him.
“What makes her so special? I bet she has like a magic vagina or something plus, she's probably slept with all three of them.”
I look away from Kellan just as he passes by us, and gasp at my best friend. “Sam, stop staring before she beats you up as well as you ending up in the hospital!”
“What? It's not like she can hear me.”
I grab Sam's hand and drag her down the corridor towards our English class. We take our seats near the front row, take out the reading book and wait for Mr Daniels. “Honestly, I guarantee you that she's sleeping with one of them.” Sam points with the tip of her pen to the back of the class without looking back. I look over my shoulder towards the back and see the four of them sitting together, but neither of them speak to each other. Silver sits beside Ryder as always. She always remains by his side.
I look over at Ryder, his expression remaining impassive as Silver strokes his arm compassionately. Anyone could tell just by looking at her that she's in awe of him. Kellan on the other hand, remains silent and sits with his elbows on the table, his head resting between them. Bane sits with his legs crossed on top of the table with his hands resting behind his head. He looks around the room like he's observing everything around him. Only then did it hit me. “Sam!” I hit her hand as I'm turning around and accidentally knock the pen out of her hand.
“That's my favourite pen.” She points down towards the floor. “It never hurt anybody.”
“Are they even supposed to be in this class? Why am I only realizing this now?” I motion towards the back and tilt my head to the back of the room.
“It's the middle of senior year so...no. The school doesn't let people change course in the middle of the year but I don't know. Maybe they worked something out with Mr Daniels?”
She picks up her pen and inspects the damage “You owe me a new pen by the way. This fountain pen was a gift I got on my birthday.”
“Yeah, sure.” I look towards the back of the class again, only to realize that they're all staring back at me. They really were intimidating.
Silver tilts her head to the side and stares at me with a hateful glare, while Bane's jaw ticks.
I knit my brows and look towards Kellan. He smiles a small smile, his eyes crinkle at the sides when I smile back at him. He only smiles for a second, then looks down at his desk again. I move my head completely to face Ryder, and for the first time in years, I really take a good look at him.
He has a chiselled shaped face with tanned spotless skin. Emerald green eyes that keep you staring, but his eyes hold no threat nor hatred, just a pure curious stare. I look at him as he stares back at me to see him smirking. His lips are full, yet firm.
I bet he's kissed a lot of girls with those lips...
After adjusting his beanie, he slicks his shiny black hair to the side and sticks his tongue out at me. I knit my brows in confusion again, and turn around, “Asshole.”
As I face the front of the class all I hear is Ryder laughing from the back.
Shit! Can he lip-read!?
“Who's the asshole?” Sam looks around the room to find the culprit but only finds me staring at her.
She points to herself in panic. “If this is about the pen don't worry about it.”
“No it's nothing. I'm just not up for work tonight.” I pick up the book and skim over the blurb.
“Behind on homework? I can help you at the diner tonight if you want?'
“Thanks, but I'm sure I'll be able to catch up on time.”
I pull out a pen from my pencil case just as the door to the classroom opens.
Is Mr. Daniels off sick today?
“Good morning students, my name is Mr Edmund, and I will be your English teacher for the rest of the school semester. I believe you are reading the novel Wuthering Heights. Can anyone volunteer to start us off?”
He writes his name on the whiteboard as Oliver Edmund. “Where's Mr. Daniels?”
“I'm not obliged to share that information with you, Ms. Frey.”
He turns around, and stares at Sam with his cold demeanour.
“Sir? We were promised to have our test results back today.”
This practice test was everything I needed to pass for next weeks exam. If I'm going to fail another class, I'm not sure I'm going to survive the rest of senior year.
“Alice, isn't it?”
He walks down the aisle holding the clipboard that holds everyone's name, and tilts his head to the side.
“That is correct, yes.” I say with a calm, and collected voice.
“Always raise your hand if you have a question.”
He does a once over on me, then walks to the front of the class, and points to the board.
“I'm your teacher now. Whatever Mr Daniels taught you before, forget about it because he's not coming back.”
He claps his hands together and looks at me. “Now Alice, why don't you start reading for us. Chapter 8, I presume?” He sits down in the chair, and motions with his hand for me start reading.
Where are you, Mr. Daniels?
Chapter 3

At six o'clock, I work my way towards the back of the diner to the office, where Robbie sits behind his desk on the phone.
“Yes, love. Of course, I'll make sure to buy the right one this time, alright love you too. Bye.”
He looks at me with his toothless grin. “Alice, how are you?”
“I'm good, thank you, but I just wanted to ask you if there's an extra uniform here somewhere?”
“What happened to the uniform you have?”
He stands from the old wooden chair, and looks in the cardboard boxes that are placed at the back of the office.
“I spilt some coffee on the shirt, and the stain won't come off.”
I can't lie for shit, but he seems to be buying it.
He sits back down just as he hands me a new uniform, “Be careful this time, alright? I mean, I know you like your coffee, but if it happens again, I'm going to have to ask you to pay for it.”
I take the uniform from him, “Thank you, Robbie, and this time I promise to be more careful.”
I walk rapidly towards the bathroom, lock the door and look at myself in the mirror. I had a heart-shaped face with rosy coloured cheekbones. My never-ending white blonde hair is always kept in a braid down my back. Ivory skin with bright pale blue eyes; like the clear sky. My mother tells me that my eyes are like the colour of diamonds, eyes that are so pale they could appear as white. My teeth are perfectly straight and white after years of my mother lecturing me about how to look after them. My nose is a little on the prominent side, but you can blame my father for that. Thankfully, that's the only thing I have of him.
I've never known my father, nor will I ever want to know him.
After a few moments I sigh, close my eyes and rest my hands on either side of the sink.
Just get it over and done with!
I open my eyes and take off my shirt swiftly, and look over my shoulder to look at the bite.
“What the hell...?”
I look in the mirror to see nothing but pure smooth skin, “Where is it...?”
Not a single bite mark was to be seen.
I didn't understand. It happened just hours ago and yet it's gone?
After changing into my uniform, I walk out of the bathroom and place myself behind the counter, but I couldn't concentrate on doing anything. Questions kept interrupting my thoughts, but I couldn't answer either of them. Maybe it healed overnight?
I peel my shirt over my right shoulder and check again. Nothing.
“Christ, Alice, you trying to give these people a strip tease or something?”
I roll my eyes when I hear her voice. I look towards the front of the diner to see Sam walking towards me with her school bag draped over her shoulder. She takes out her laptop and today's homework, and sits directly in front of me on our new red diner stools.
“I'll have a strawberry milkshake and a few fries please.” She types away on her laptop as I prepare the milkshake.
I walk to the kitchen to see Terry preparing the food for the waiting customers.
“Another order of fries on its own but it's Sam, so take your time, okay”' I do a thumbs up but he doesn't see it, or he's probably ignoring it.
As I walk back into the diner, I realize it's not as busy as I thought it would be.
“Alice, the milkshake's kinda overflowing.” Sam says nonchalantly.
“Shit!”
I rush to the milkshake machine, clean up the mess and pass it over the counter.
“Thank you kindly.” Sam takes a sip of the milkshake, sighs in delight and puts away the laptop.
“So, what do you think of our new English teacher? Hot right?” She winks at me. “I mean, I would.”
“Sam! He's like forty years old!” I hit her with the dishcloth that I keep on my shoulder.
“Age is just a number!”
All the patrons in the diner stop talking, turn in their chairs and stare at the two of us as we laugh over Sam's infatuation with our new teacher. I apologize immediately to them for our adolescent behaviour.
“Sam seriously, he's old enough to be your father.” I clean the counter to look busy when the diner door opens.
Almost immediately, I notice everything falling silent.
I glance over to see why the place has gone quiet, only to see four tall frames at the diner's entrance.Why were they here? They looked so out of place.
Bane walks with confidence towards the closest patron, leaving the other three standing guard at the door. He leans down to one of the regulars and speaks to him. I didn't know how I could hear him, but I heard every single word.
“You might wanna stop staring at us before I tear you apart piece by piece big man.”
“Hey!” I rush from behind the counter, stand directly in front of him only to be met with a broad chest.
“I don't care who you are, but I won't have you talking to the regulars like that.”
At this point, Ryder stands by Bane's side, never taking his eyes away from me.
“Are you saying we aren't welcome here because we're not regulars?” Bane looks at me with pure disgust written on his face.
“Of course, you're welcome here, but if you're going to disrespect the regulars then I'm going to have to ask you to leave.”
I say this with as much confidence as I can muster, but with Ryder standing with his eyes on me the whole time, I'm really quite surprised I haven't shat myself.
“We aren't here to start trouble. We just came to have some food in this highly recommended diner that you have here.” Ryder's voice fills the whole diner. While he speaks, I can't help but stand there looking into his bright green eyes.
“Well, as long as you don't start trouble, take a seat, and I'll grab you some menus.” I say.
Neither of us takes our eyes away from each other, but the connection is broken too quickly when I hear Sam's voice calling me.
“Alice! Where the hell are my goddamn fries!?”
I turn around to see Sam giving me the grumpiest look ever known to mankind.
Without looking at Ryder, I excuse myself and walk behind the counter, my hands shake as I grab four menus and four pairs of cutlery. I glance up again to see Ryder sitting in one of the booths with his friends, but his eyes remain on me.
“I'm known for being a patient person, but please give me my fries!”
“I told Terry to take his time, so whenever Terry's ready to make your fries, he'll make them.”
I walk past the counter, and laugh when I hear Sam confronting Terry in the kitchen.
While that's happening, I stand at the edge of the table and hand Ryder all the menus.
“I'll be back in a few minutes to take your order. Kitchen closes at seven thirty.” I hurry back to the cashier, when I notice Sam sitting back in her seat, with a few fries on a plate.
“Those aren't yours, are they?” I point towards the fries on the plate just as I hear Terry yelling from the kitchen.
“Nope, but they're mine now.” She grabs for another fry just as her elbow knocks the milkshake over, and that's when everything happens in slow motion.
Time slows down as I see the milkshake descend to the floor. I feel this uncontrollable urge to catch it before it falls. With the time slowing down, it gives me enough time to catch it, just inches before it spills everywhere. I look at the milkshake resting in my hand and check around me to see if anyone noticed, but I'm only met with four curious sets of eyes.
“Nice reflexes you got there Alice.”
Sam doesn't seem as freaked out like I am right now. Instead, she picks up another fry just as I slam down the milkshake on the counter, to which it topples over.
My breath hitches, “You didn't see that?”
“See what? You rescuing my delicious milkshake that is now spilling everywhere on this counter?”
“Sam, honestly, I'm freaking out right now!” “Are you okay? Want me to call your mum?”
“No, I just. I need to tell you something about what happened here last night.” I whisper to her over the counter in the hope that nobody hears me.
“What's going on with you today? And why are you whispering? No one's looking at us.”
“They're watching.” I answer.
Sam remains looking at them until she turns around and tells me that they're leaving.
“What's the problem? What happened last night?”
I take a steady breath, and replay the events of last night. “I was working here last night until closing hour. Terry and I were the only ones left at the diner. He asked me to take the trash out to the dumpster and I heard a growl from behind me. It was so quiet I thought I didn't hear anything, but I turned around and saw the biggest wolf I've ever seen, and I've never seen a wolf that big before in Small Town.”
Sam rolls her eyes. “I mean we see wolves all the time, we live in Small Town for gods sakes! We're gonna see wolves running around and for one being here, it was probably drawn to the smell of rotting food or something.”
Sam grabs her schoolbag from the floor, and starts packing her things.
“Sam, I'm telling you, it was huge! It bit me right on the shoulder and ran away!”
Sam stops packing her thing, and looks at me with pure worry on her face.
“It bit you? Did you tell your mum to look at it?”
I shake my head knowing she's about to have an outburst. “No.”
“Why the hell not!? She's a nurse! God knows what that thing carries.”
“There wasn't any point in telling her because by the time I went to bed the cuts were all sealed closed, and the marks were completely gone when I changed for work.”
I show her my shoulder to find it still the same. No bite marks.
“Why didn't you say anything in school?”
“I didn't think it really mattered when I woke up this morning and only saw a few cuts there.” A pause.
“I wish I knew what to tell you or at least give you advice but...”
Sam remains calm and collected, but I know that on the inside she worries too.
“Your milkshake would have been on the floor if I hadn't moved to grab it in time. I'm telling you now, everything in this room moved in slow motion like the time was slowing down for me to catch it before it leaked on the floor. And then hearing Bane whispering to Paul to stop staring or he'd tear him apart. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he's sitting right by the door and I'm all the way back here! Something's wrong with me!”
I turn around to face the coffee machine and pour myself a large cup of coffee.
Sam speaks to me in a quiet and comforting tone, she probably knows that I'm close to losing my mind.
“This all happened after it bit you?”
“Yeah, and it scares me to even think about what could happen to me. What if I actually turn into one?” I turn around with my mug of coffee and sit next to her.
Sam scoffs, “You're my best friend, and whatever happens just know that I'll be there for you. Even if you don't want my help, you shouldn't go through this alone. So, if you do turn into a big scary wolf, which is impossible by the way, I promise not to tell anyone. The last thing I want is you chasing me on a full moon.”
Sam stays with me till the end of the shift but leaves shortly when her mother comes to take her home. Sally offers to take me home, but I politely decline because I've got to lock up the diner.
I take out the trash, brush and mop the floor, then change out of my uniform. I lock up the back and exit through the front.
I double check that the door is locked when I hear rustling coming from behind me. I shrug it off blaming the wind, but when I hear it again I can't help but think it's the wolf from last night. I stay rooted to the ground in absolute fright when I hear laughter coming from behind me.
I turn around a little too quickly, and fall forwards on the floor.
“I didn't know for sure, but I had to check to see if I was right and now that I know, I was right about you.”
I look up into Ryder's cold, distrusting green eyes.
I stand with unsteady legs, and shiver when my back connects with the diner's cold, damp door, “What are you talking about?”
Ryder, Bane and Silver create a half circle around me. Ryder was standing in front of me while the other two stands on either side.
Kellan remains a little further behind Ryder, showing no signs of joining this little confrontation.
Silver steps forward, grabs my braid and pulls my head back hard. She leans forward right into my jugular and inhales. “She's new, but she's changing fast. I wouldn't be surprised if she changes tonight if she survives that is.”
She shoves my head forward and stands back.
It's Bane's turn to step forward. He stands in front of me, shielding Ryder from view. Bane reaches out with his giant-sized hand and wraps his hand around my delicate throat. “Let's get one thing clear here. I don't like you nor will I ever like you. I don't trust easily when it comes to people like you. His scent is all over you, and it's taking every ounce of control I have not to kill you.”
“Kill me?” I stutter.
“I promise you, if you get in my way and humiliate me again as you did in there, I'll kill you myself.”
I reach with both of my hands to stop Bane from strangling me. His figure goes all blurry, when suddenly his hand disappears from my throat. I fall to the ground like a rag doll on all fours, and start gasping for air.
I hear them arguing above me, but I can't make out a single word.
I look up with blurry eyes to see Kellan standing in front of me in a protective stance.
“He was killing her and you weren't gonna do shit about it! She's got nothing to do with the murders here!”
Ryder's head tilts to the side as he listens to Kellan, “You don't know that. Anyway, leave us. I need to have a little conversation with Alice. Alone.”
Both Silver and Bane snicker like hyenas as they run into the middle of the road.
“Kellan, leave. I'm not going to hurt her.”
Ryder kneels down in front of me and cups my cheek gently.
As Kellan walks away, he turns around and looks at Ryder with warm, sorrowful eyes. “She's no threat to us.”
“Go home, Kellan!”
By the time I can stand on my own two feet, Kellan's already out of sight.
Chapter 4

The last thing I wanted do right now is to have a conversation with Ryder. I'd rather stick pins in my eyes and cut out my tongue than speak to him. But here we are, in the middle of the night.
“Look, I'm really tired and a little pissed off with you and your friends. So just say what you got to say and leave me alone.”
Hopefully, he'll never have to speak to me again. “What happened to you last night?”
I should have moved when I had the chance because right now, my boobs are getting to know his chest really well.
“Absolutely nothing. And anyway, it's not like I owe you an explanation.”
Ryder cages me in with both of his hands on either side of my head. “You think I didn't see you inside that diner? We all did! So I need to know what happened to you last night.”
“Why is it so important for you to know?” I duck underneath his arm, and start walking.
“Alice! You need to listen to me.”
Before I know it, Ryder grabs my wrist and turns me around to face him. “You may not believe me, but I'm trying to help you.” “Help me!?”
“I'm trying to help you understand what you're about to go through.”
“And what would that be?” I take my hand from his hold, and place my hands on my hips in expectation of his answer.
“You might think I'm joking, but trust me I'm not.” Ryder turns his back on me, places his hands in his pockets and sighs in defeat. “In a few days, you'll go through the change.”
I frown. “The change?”
“Very soon, you'll experience the change. The change of becoming a wolf.”
A what?
I look at him in confusion, then burst out laughing.
He turns around and looks at me, his nostrils flaring “Stop laughing. This is not a joke. I don't joke about things like this. By the look of things, it's going to happen pretty soon.”
Surely he doesn't mean that I'm actually going to turn into a wolf because that's just crazy.
I roll my eyes, “Okay, I'll play along. What happens during this change?”
“Pain. A lot of pain.”
I sigh, “I've been in pain before you know.”
“Not this kind of pain. You'll start sweating a lot and you're gonna feel really hot. You'll also start to feel nauseous and if I remember correctly a headache too. Just think of it as a bad fever because that's not the worst part.”
I scoff. “What could possibly be worse than turning into a monster?”
He ignores my question and continues. “Your body is gonna feel like it's going to explode, and the last thing you want to do is fight it. Your body's telling you that the wolf inside of you is ready to take over, and if you fight it the first time, you're most likely to not survive the next change. So, whatever you do, don't fight it.”
“How do you know all of this? Are you a wolf?” Ryder merely shrugs. “We all are.”
“Who's we?”
Ryder doesn't answer me. He only gives me this knowing look that gives me the realization that I need to know what he means by his expression.
“You're saying that Bane, Silver and Kellan are wolves? Come on, be serious?”
“You think I'd be helping you if you weren't becoming one of us? Your scent was all over that diner for any wolf to pick up on it.”
Ryder's hands are balled into fists as he stares at me with a dark evil glint in his eyes. I don't care if he's angry or frustrated with me. I just wanted to go home and forget this conversation ever happened.
I scoff in disbelief. “I'm not becoming one of you! This kind of thing just doesn't happen to people!”
“You what to know what happened to Mr Daniels!? How his body was found ripped to shreds in his own home!?”
I can't take this anymore, I do the only thing I can think of to block Ryder's voice. I cover my ears and pray that he stops.
“Stop it!”
I beg and beg for him to stop, but he only carries on. “What's going on out here?”
Not only has Ryder stopped shouting, but his whole body stiffens when he notices Terry standing with a flashlight pointed right at him. “He giving you trouble, Alice?”
I take my hands away from my ears and shake my head. “No, he was just leaving.”
Ryder looks back at with me desperation in his eyes, but I can't listen to another word he has to say.
“Goodnight Terry.” I walk away, leaving both men standing alone in the dark.
The walk to my home was surprisingly peaceful. There were no run-ins with Ryder nor an encounter with a wolf. Just me and the sounds of nature. I hear the blood-curdling screams of the wild fox and the loud belching of the red deer stags in the night.
I take the shortcut home and come across the clearing of the forest that stands between me and my home. I believe that many secrets are in this forest, but I feel no threat nor am I afraid to know what hides inside it.
As I stand at the clearing, I feel nothing but power. I've experienced the feeling of becoming close to death, and I couldn't feel more alive.
I dash through the forest and leap over the thin winding creeks and the slippery rocks. I dodge and zip past rotting oak trees and under lowered branches. Bugs zip in and out of my ears, humming and buzzing their little song. Green leaves, yellow leaves and red leaves scatter on the ground like a rainbow of rich, autumnal colours. Ahead, the forest trees get thinner.
I'm close to home.
As I draw closer, I see the old worn bridge that leads to the road opposite my home.
Home sweet home.
I live with my mother in a quiet residential area in a beautiful detached house. It's been the only home I've ever lived in, and there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be because of the silence and peacefulness the house provides. The house has a big garden with beautiful trees, plants and even a swimming pool. The house is pretty spacious for only the two of us, with two floors and a smaller third floor with big windows.
The gate is on the ground floor where the big hall communicates with two comfortable airy living rooms, a bathroom, and a modern large kitchen is placed in the heart of the house. One living room has a door that leads out to the terrace that overlooks the garden. On the first floor are four rooms which consist of two doubles and two singles with two bathrooms.
My mother sleeps in the main bedroom which has its own bathroom and her own balcony.
I walk across the road and reach the wraparound porch in front of the house, and turn the handle to see that it's locked.
Mum should be home by now.
I tap my knuckles on the pristine glass door, and wait for any sign of movement.
I tap again and wait a few minutes longer. Nothing.
I move to check underneath the doormat and see the lone silver key.
I guess she's not home.
I pick up the key and enter the house, “Mum? Are you home?”
Not once did she answer me when I called her. Maybe she had a date tonight?
I take the stairs down into the kitchen, and notice a piece of paper stuck on the refrigerator.
Alice,
Got called down to the hospital, Probably won't be home till morning, Supper is in the microwave
Love you, Mum x
I guess that adds up to where she is.
I open the microwave and groan in satisfaction when I smell the sweet aroma of the pepperoni pizza.
My mother knows me too well.
Before I change out of my clothes and into my nightwear, I reheat the pizza and grab myself a can of coke.
By the time I come down the stairs, I take the pizza and can over to the sofa in front of the TV, and download the season finale of Game of Thrones.
Again, questions rush inside my head.
What if what Ryder says is true? That I'm changing into one of the most dangerous predators known to humans?
Whatever happens to me, the last thing I want to do is hurt somebody. I'd never forgive myself if I did.
I come out of my trance to the opening theme of Game of Thrones when suddenly everything in the room starts to blur. I can't see anything.
I wipe my eyes with the palm of my hands to feel that my face is burning.
I hear my heart beating rapidly inside my chest, and I start to notice that I'm struggling to breathe properly.
I stand on my feet to work my way towards the bathroom when suddenly I feel a stabbing pain in my stomach. It was like my insides were being twisted and pulled.
I pull the bathroom door open and balance myself on the sink.
I look in the mirror to see myself completely drenched in sweat.
Oh no...It's happening! What do I do!?
My head starts to throb as the pain in my stomach becomes too excruciating to cope with.
The more I try to stop the agonizing pain, I feel the most intense agony searing into my lower back, and all I can do is scream.
The pain becomes worse whenever I try to fight it, and straight away I feel nausea creeping up my throat. I double over and vomit violently to see black liquid coating the edges of the toilet.
I lose count of the amounts of time I vomit, but I refuse to stop fighting.
I refuse to change.
I don't care how long the pain takes, I won't give in to the change.
After what feels like intense hours, I sigh in relief as I rest my cheekbone on the cold surface of the toilet. My vision was starting to clear ever so slowly. The pain in my stomach, and lower back have subsided, and I can finally breathe again. My heart beats to its normal two-beat rhythm, and my head stops throbbing.
With unsteady legs, I get up from the position on the toilet and clean the bathroom from top to bottom.
After I finish cleaning, I sit on the floor and promise myself to only rest my eyes for a couple of minutes.
I don't hear the door open, nor do I hear my mother calling my name several times. She finds me exactly as I am sitting on the floor with my head resting on the toilet. I open my eyes and look at her.
“Alice honey, what are you doing on the floor?” She looks at me with worry in her eyes.
She stands by the bathroom door in her pink scrubs, holding her black knitted cardigan in her arms.
“I got sick.”
My mother kneels down on the floor in front of me and places her hand on my forehead.
“Did you catch a fever or something?”
“Yeah, maybe.”
'Right, well I think you should rest and drink plenty of water, and I'll call the doctor tomorrow if you want before I go to work, okay honey? No school for you tomorrow.”
She kisses me on the forehead and helps me slowly off the floor.
“How was work?” I follow my mother into the kitchen, and sit on the bar stool as she turns off the TV.
I've missed Game of Thrones. Again.
“Work was a little hectic but I'm happy to be home. Everything okay in school?”' She brings the uneaten pizza, and the unopened can of coke, into the kitchen and sets them on the counter.
“School was okay I guess. We have a new English teacher.”
“A new teacher? What happened to Mr. Daniels?” “I don't know. Maybe he quit?”
I don't know why I didn't tell my mother about Mr. Daniels, but I don't think telling her that he was supposedly found ripped to shreds in his home a good idea.
Who knows? Maybe Ryder only told me that to scare me?
“Well that's a shame. He was such a good teacher and he adored you.”
“I know, but.” I shrug my shoulders and stand to give my mother a hug. “Goodnight mom.”
She squeezes me tightly as she kisses the top of my head. “Goodnight honey. I love you.”
“Love you too.”
I walk up the stairs into my bedroom and lean my head against the door.
I actually did it, I did not change into a wolf.
I laugh hysterically to myself, feeling a great amount of triumph.
My body feels incredibly weak and drained after the events of last night and tonight, but at least the vomiting has stopped.
A part of me feels relieved that I won't have to face Ryder tomorrow, but the other part of me wants to tell him what happened here tonight.
He did tell me though that if I fought the change the first time, I'm less likely to survive the next change.
Chapter 5

Early the next morning, I wake up to my mother asking me if she needs to phone the doctor for me, but I decide to go back to sleep when I tell her that I was feeling better.
She kissed me goodbye and left for work soon after.
I don't wake up till late afternoon and when I do, I wake up to see five missed calls from Sam.
Great.
I sit up and dial her phone number, she answers immediately.
“Fucking finally! She's alive!” I hear her laughing on the other end.
“Very funny Sam.” I get up from the bed and walk downstairs into the kitchen to prepare myself breakfast.
“I'm sorry, I just wanted to know where my partner in crime was.”
“I'm at home. Didn't feel well last night.”
I open the cupboard, grab the loaf of bread and put one in the toaster.
“Did you get sick or something?”
“Yeah and guess what, mum found me on the edge of the toilet seat. She told me to stay home and sleep it off.”
“Okay your mum sucks for telling you that, but I guess if you aren't feeling well, then the best place for you to be is at home.”
“I guess, but I'm totally feeling fine right now. How's school?”
I hear nothing but silence on the other end. “Sam?” I warm up the kettle, take the toast out of the toaster and start spreading the butter.
I look to see if she accidentally pressed the end call button, but call her name again when I see that she hasn't. “Sam?”
“Ryder keeps staring at me and it's really creepy.” She whispers into the phone.
“What do you mean?” I grab myself a mug from the cupboard, make myself a cup of tea and sit down on the brown leather sofa.
“Well I'm sitting next to Alex who sits at the back of the class because he knows all the answers, and I don't know why but Ryder keeps looking at me.”
“Well, maybe he fancies you?” I question her but I only mean it as a joke.
“Cut the crap Alice. We both know that's not true.” Sam spits in disgust.
“How would you know?”
“Because he couldn't take his eyes off you at the diner.”
Yeah for all the wrong reasons!
“Look, just ask him why he's staring at you. It's not like he's going to bite.” I stifle a giggle.
If only she knew.
Sam groans. “Yeah, I'd rather not do that. Look I gotta go. Mr Jackson just came in.'
“Alright, have fun in Math.”
“Fuck you, I'll see you after school.” “Okay, see you soon.”
When I end the call, I look around the house and wonder what to do in the spare time that I have before Sam comes over.
I look up at the clock to see that it's 12:30, school finishes at 3:30.
I decide to make Sam proud and watch the season finale of Game of Thrones.
As the opening credits start, I can't help but feel sad that another season has come to its end. It makes me think back to when Sam and I met when we started out as freshmen. We were seated next to each other in our English class when Mr. Daniels told us to introduce ourselves and share to each other which one character in the whole world we wanted to be. When Sam told me who she wanted to be, she instantly became my best friend because she wanted to be Arya Stark. It was one of the happiest moments of my life because I wanted to be Daenerys Targaryen; The Mother of Dragons herself. We spent our first day as freshman talking about Game of Thrones, and we've been best friends ever since.
As I watch the show and see Arya Stark training with The Waif in the House of Black and White, all I can see is Sam. A long stern face, grey eyes and short brown hair.
Skinny but athletic. Where Arya gets mistaken for looking like a boy, Sam ignores the attention from the boys in our school. She can't think of anything worse than dating a guy from high school.
When the end credits of the show roll on the black screen, all I can think about is how I'm going to cope without having this show to watch every Sunday. Maybe I should start watching something like Prison Break or True Blood? True Blood has wolves in it so I'm not gonna watch that, and Prison Break?
Maybe I'll consider it.
I look again at the clock to see that it's 2:30.
An hour till Sam gets here!
I decide to put on a blue flannel shirt and some denim shorts leaving my feet bare. With only a few minutes to spare, I wash and dry the dishes, mop and hoover the floor and wipe down all the surfaces in the house.
By the time I put the hoover and mop in the storage closet, I hear a knock on the door.
I walk casually to it, open it to find Sam looking miserable at me.
“What's with the long face?”
She rushes past me and face-plants into the sofa. “I just had to endure the whole day with creepy stares coming from Ryder and his stupid gang all day!”
I laugh softly and move to sit in front of her on the coffee table.
“Did you ask him why he was staring at you?”
She turns her head to look at me and shakes her head. “Nope. He freaks me out, and it wasn't just him staring, it was all of them.”
I can only shrug. “I don't know what to say.”
Sam frowns. “Do you think maybe they were trying to lip read me?”
“What makes you think that?”
“Well, when I was sitting in the cafeteria, they were all staring at me like they were waiting for something. And then again in Math, I was talking to you on the phone and Ryder would not stop looking at me, and he doesn't even have Math!”
Maybe I should tell Sam about what happened last night at the diner, I want to involve her in on what goes on in my life.
“Maybe they were staring because they kind of ambushed me last night after work.”
She shrieks, “What!?”
“I was ambushed by the four of them after work except for Kellan, he stayed out of the confrontation part, but the rest of them interrogated me about the night I was bitten.”
Sam moves to lie on her side with a confused expression on her face. “Why would they want to know about what happened to you that night?”
Before I can respond to her question, I hear a knock on the door and see Sam frowning at me.
“Are you expecting someone?” “No, just you.”
We both look towards the door and wait.
“Should I go answer it?” I ask. “Maybe it's someone for my mum?”
“Leave it.” Sam grabs the remote off the coffee table and turns on the TV.
“Sam, I can't just leave whoever's out there waiting. I'll be right back.”
I hear Sam murmur something under her breath, but it's too quiet for me to hear what she said.
I walk briskly to the front door and can't believe my eyes who I see on the other side. I stare at him open-mouthed.
“Didn't think I'd find you?” Ryder's hip leans against the door jamb.
I step outside and shut the door behind me.
“What the hell are you doing here!?” I spit. “How did you find me!?”
“I came over to apologize about last night.” “How did you find me!?”' I repeat.
'You know the answer to that question. Besides, I had to check on you.” He frowns and shakes his head, “Something's wrong with your scent.”
“What do you mean?”
“It's different. Like it's receding.”
He looks at me in confusion. “Did something happen to you last night, Alice?”
I don't say a word.
He backs me up against the wall next to the door and places his palm next to my face. “I won't ask you again. If something happened to you then I need to know.”
I bite my lip and look away from him. “I think you better leave.”
“I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what happened.”
“You want to know what happened? Fine. I fought the change.”
A few seconds pass by when suddenly Ryder punches the wall right next to me. I shrink back against the wall.
“Why do something when I told you to do the fucking opposite!? Did you not listen to a word I said to you last night?”
“I fought the change because I didn't want to become a monster.” I move his arm to slip past. “Like you and the others.”
I walk back inside the house just as I hear Ryder's loud piercing roar coming from outside.
A shiver runs down my spine.
When I reach the living room, I see that Sam hasn't moved from her position on the sofa, but she soon hears my footsteps just as I sit in the armchair.
“Who was it?”
“None other than the creeper himself.”
Sam's eyes shift to me in a heartbeat. “Ryder's here?” “Yeah, I left him outside.”
One minute Sam's lying on the sofa and the next she's out the door.
By the time I get up from the chair and rush outside onto the porch, I notice five figures in total. I see Sam and Ryder at each other's throats spitting insults to each other, but then I notice three beautiful wolves standing behind Ryder in a protective stance.
Is that Bane, Silver and Kellan? No...That's impossible.
I ignore Sam and Ryder arguing and turn to look at each wolf individually.
The smaller one out of the three has icy, cold blue eyes and razor sharp teeth. Fur the colour of ash that looks soft and well kept. The hairs at the back of the neck are erect, clearly indicating its anger. It growls as it looks at Sam but does not strike once.
Next to the grey wolf stands a much bigger wolf. Dark brown coats its entire body like a rough silk blanket, with a speck of white running down its narrow chest, its eyes the colour of the brightly lit sky and razor-sharp teeth.
But the last wolf doesn't join in with the other wolves. It stares directly at me as I stand by the door, and I don't know why but something tells me that this wolf held no threat. I had a feeling in my gut telling me exactly who it was. Kellan.
His coat is so light it could appear as pure gold, but his eyes are yellow.
That's odd. .Why are the eyes different?
I reach out with my hand towards Kellan. He slowly approaches me, inhales and nudges my hand with his head. His coat feels incredibly smooth like silk. As I stroke him, I feel completely mesmerised to think that a part of Kellan is somewhere inside this magnificent predator.
I stare at the scene in front of me, Ryder and Sam stand inches away from each other, and it sounds to me like Sam's giving him complete hell after what happened last night.
I do the only thing I can think of and grab Sam by the wrist, and pull her back to where I stand by the door. “Alright, that's enough from both of you!”
The two wolves move to stand on either side of Ryder while Kellan stands beside me. Ryder gives the two wolves next to him a sign for them to stop growling, and they do instantly.
“Who the fuck do you think you are!? You had no right interrogating her like that!” Sam shrieks.
Ryder looks at Sam with distaste. “Everything she does concerns me!” He points at me. “Did she tell you what happened to her last night?”
“What are you talking about?' Sam frowns and looks at me, 'Alice?”
“Tell her how you fought the change, and that you're most likely gonna die the next time.”
Sam gasps. “Alice, is this true?”
“Only because I didn't want to become a monster!' I seethe angrily towards Ryder and stand in front of him, both wolves start growling again.
“I've asked you to leave once. I won't ask you again.” Ryder smirks. “Are you threatening me, Alice?” “Yes.”
I look into his eyes but freeze when I see that his eyes have turned bright red.
He cups my cheek and whispers in my ear. “You really shouldn't threaten an Alpha.”
Chapter 6

I stand there rooted to the ground, unable to look away from his eyes, the eyes of an Alpha.
Everything around me doesn't exist as I stare into the eyes of a predator, and right now Ryder looks at me like a predator watching its prey.
I pull his hand away from my cheek, walk tentatively to grab Sam's hand and pull her behind me.
“Leave us alone.”
Ryder shakes his head. “I can't do that. I need you to tell me what happened last night because something has definitely changed. After you tell me what I need to know, then I'll leave.”
I grit my teeth. “I'm not telling you anything.”
Before I have a chance to finish talking, the two wolves standing next to Ryder shift into human forms.
Both Bane and Silver stand completely naked. “What the hell!?” I hear Sam gasp behind me. I turn around to see that Kellan has shifted too. Wow.
I take in his whole appearance but blush when my eyes finally meet his.
Shit!
He totally caught me checking him out. I clear my throat and turn to face Ryder.
“Why don't we just beat it out of her?” Bane growls.
Silver curls her arm around Ryder's waist, pressing her chest seductively against his arm. “I'll do it, Ryder, I'll give you what you want.”
She looks at me and smirks.
Ryder pulls Silver's hand away and walks towards me in his black wife-beater and ripped jeans, he stands in front of me. “Tell me everything and I'll leave.”
His eyes are back to emerald green. “Please.”
I gently nod and turn to open the door only to be met with Sam's wide-eyed stare, and her mouth wide open.
I look back to what she's staring at but only see that she's looking at Bane.
I quietly giggle to myself and poke Sam in the ribs before she gets caught. She instantly closes her mouth and clears her throat, murmuring a quiet thank you when she passes to enter the house. Silver soon follows after Ryder but not before she nudges me with her shoulder to pass. Bane says nothing as he follows with a sneer on his face.
I turn to see that Kellan's stopped in front of me with a warm smile painted on his face.
“That's where it bit you?” He points at my shoulder. On instinct, I touch it. “Yeah.”
“I promise that whoever did this to you won't live to see another day.”
“Thank you.” I sigh. “I haven't really thought about that night.”
“It's a lot to take in I know, but you'll realize with your new abilities what amazing things you can do.”
I smile. “You know, I never thanked you for last night. You stepped in and stopped Bane from hurting me.”
He shrugs. “Don't mention it. I only did what I thought was right.”
“I know but thanks. It meant a lot to me.”
As the both of us turn to enter the house, Ryder stands in the hall with his hands in his pockets, looking at the two of us curiously. He indicates with his head to the living room.
When I enter the living room, I see that Bane and Silver have taken place on the sofa covered in Afghans thanks to Sam who sits in the armchair. She's still looking at Bane again with a huge grin on her face. Ryder takes his place standing by the window, while Kellan remains by my side.
I leave the room to grab Kellan a spare blanket but when I return I notice that nobody has said a word.
After what feels like hours of intense silence, Sam decides to break the ice.
“Alright, what the hell is going on?”
When nobody answers, she looks at me questioningly.
“Alice?”
Here goes nothing.
I look around the room to see that everyone's looking at me expectantly. “Last night at the diner.” I gulp and look away from everyone. “I heard Bane threaten our regular Paul, for staring at all of you, and I knew something was wrong when I was able to hear everything.”
I look towards Bane to see him staring at me with the same sneer still on his face.
“Then, the milkshake incident that you all saw. I'm certain that the time slowed itself down for me to catch it. If that weren't possible that milkshake would have been all over the floor.'
Ryder sighs loud enough for everyone in the room to hear. “We all know about what happened at the diner. Quit stalling. I want to know why you fought the change?”
Sam turns to Ryder with an annoyed expression on her face. “Back the hell off and stop rushing her.”
Silver growls from her seat on the sofa that instantly makes Sam turn to her. “And you? Quit acting like a bitch in heat and shut up.”
Kellan grabs a hold of my hand and calls my name silently, I look at him to see worry etched on his face, “You don't have to tell us anything if you don't want to.”
“Yes, she does.” Ryder scoffs. “If we have any chance of knowing how to catch whoever's murdering people in this town then yes, she has to tell us everything!”
“Whoever bit her might not even be responsible for the murders!” Kellan yells back.
“What murders?”
Everyone in the room ignores Sam again. “For God's sake! Someone, please answer me!”
Ryder clears his throat. “There's been a few murders in this town that have been kept on the down low. Major signs of animal attacks. We don't know who's responsible for the murders or why they're killing these people, but the number of bodies are piling up and the murderer knows how to cover its tracks. The four of us have tried finding a scent at every crime scene, but we never catch the scent.”
“Are you positive the attacks are caused by a wolf?” Sam asks.
“Of course we are you gormless prat!” Silver spits, “Kellan's father's a cop and he tells everything to his son. All murders are the same, bodies ripped to shreds. What kind of animal can do that? A wolf, and so far it's been five bodies. Mr Daniels was the fifth victim. We're recognizing a pattern so it's not just some random killing spree.”
“What's the pattern?” I ask quietly.
“One body every month.” Bane murmurs. “There's no way in hell we're gonna catch this fucker.”
A man of few words.
“Look if it helps either of you, I could describe to you what the wolf looked like.”
“It won't matter.” Ryder sighs. “You see, when you change for the first time, you're introduced to new abilities. Strength, Sound and Scent.” He turns to face the whole room. “Wolves can hide their scent after a long period of time, but only highly experienced wolves can do it. Whoever bit you can do exactly that. When I passed you in the hall, I could smell the venom in your body, but no scent of the wolf that bit you. The scent disappears if you fight the change, and you did. See, if you would've let your body change, you would have been able to identify that bond an Alpha does with its Beta. The chances of you finding that bond now is zero.”
“Ryder I was only trying to help.”
