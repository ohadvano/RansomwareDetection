SUNSHINE LOWERS CHOLESTEROL

Cholesterol is a substance that can only be found in meat, poultry, fish, and animal

products such as eggs, milk, and cheese. Cholesterol is not found in fruits, vegetables,

nuts, grains, etc. Our bodies manufacture cholesterol from fats, oils, sugars, and proteins.

Cholesterol is a member of the steroid family. This family is a group of substances that are

similar in their molecular structure, but very different in their effects on the body. It is

important to understand that vitamin D and cholesterol are in the steroid family. It was in

1904 that one research scientist discovered that sunlight was able to transform cholesterol

to Vitamin D. Human skin has a very rich supply of cholesterol, and this cholesterol keeps

moving back and forth between the skin and the blood stream. If it is removed from the

skin, then the cholesterol from the blood stream moves into the skin to replace the

cholesterol that was lost.

It has been found that not only does sunlight cause a prompt and significant

reduction in the amount of cholesterol in the skin, but that it also affects the overal

cholesterol metabolism of the whole body. When the skin is exposed to sunlight,

cholesterol is destroyed so rapidly and to such a great extent that the total body

cholesterol is decreased. A study was done using 30 patients who had hardening of the

arteries. Each of these patient's blood cholesterol level was lower after a single sunlight

treatment. Other studies with larger numbers of patients show similar results.



SUNLIGHT LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE

A study done at Tulane University on the effect of ultraviolet light on blood pressure

showed that after a single exposure of the sun to a group of men with high blood pressure,

there was a marked lowering of the blood pressure lasting 5-6 days. In another study done

on average subjects, blood pressure dropped an average of 6 mmHg systolic and 8

mmHg diastolic after a single sunlight treatment. In individuals with high blood pressure

the effect is more striking. Some patients had the systolic pressure drop as much as 40

mmHg and diastolic by 20 mmHg.(8)

Contrary to most learned opinions, diastolic blood pressure is apparently not more

important than systolic blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure is believed to rise with



29

age. But the famous Framingham study showed that elderly individuals with high systolic

pressures had significantly higher mortality rates than their contemporaries with lower

systolic pressures.(9)



SUNSHINE LOWERS BLOOD SUGAR

Exposure to sunlight appears to have an insulin-like effect in that it causes a

lowering of the blood sugar. This is minimal in normal individuals, but dramatic in

diabetics. Sunlight facilitates the absorption of glucose into the cel s of the body and

stimulates the body to convert its blood sugar (glucose) into stored sugar (glycogen),

which is stored in the liver and muscles. This is the body's energy reserve that can be

instantly changed again into glucose to meet demands under normal or emergency

conditions.

Sunlight removes the sugar in the blood by increasing glycogen levels. Because of

this dramatic effect, a diabetic may need to adjust his insulin dose when he is fol owing a

sunbathing program because sunlight combined with insulin can have a very powerful

hypoglycemic effect. A, diabetic must sunbathe with caution. By gradual y decreasing the

dose of insulin, one may avoid a hypoglycemic reaction (10)





SUNLIGHT IMPROVES ARTHRITIS

We find that the use of sunlight for helping arthritis dates back many centuries. The

warm rays of the sun loosen stiff, sore joints and can have a general relaxing effect.

Sunlight also builds up the body's immune System. In Russia, sunlight treatments are

given routinely to miners because of their beneficial effects. In one study there was a

definite reduction of arthritis in those miners who received sunlight treatments.(11)

Cortisone was given to one group of children with severe arthritis, while a similar group

was given sunlight treatments. The arthritic Symptoms of those taking cortisone

decreased more rapidly, but the people in that group were also more susceptible to

infections and suffered some side effects from the cortisone. Although the arthritic

Symptoms of the group getting the sunlight treatments decreased more slowly, relief did

come. Resistance to infection increased, and of course, no one suffered from any of the

side effects that accompany cortisone treatment. (12)



SUNSHINE AND VITAMIN D

Recent discoveries reveal that Vitamin D is not so much a vitamin as it is a

hormone. As we become aware of Vitamin D's intricate functions as a hormone, we need

to seriously review the practice of widespread Vitamin D supplementation to our foods,

such as milk, baby foods, beverages, prepared breakfast cereals, flour, margarine, etc.

With al this supplementation, the average per capita intake is 2,435 I.U. per day or six

times the recommended 400 I.U. per day. (13)

Dietary intake of Vitamin D by pregnant women has been implicated in kidney

calcification and severe mental retardation in their offspring.(13) Children with mothers

taking extra Vitamin D in their diet may be born with a certain type of congenital heart

disease. (14)

Many authorities have recommended that Vitamin D be removed from our food. Dr.

Kinden, who gave a report from the University of Tromso, makes this Statement:

"Attempts should be made to restrict the intake of Vitamin D. from al sources." Also

recommending that Vitamin D should not be supplemental y added to food is the British

Medical Association (1950), the Canadian Bul etin on Nutrition (1953), and the American

Academy of Pediatrics (1963, 1965).



30

From the University of Tromso in Norway comes a report that a long term intake of

Vitamin D, only slightly above the 400 I.U. recommended may stimulate a heart attack.

Not only heart attacks, but also degenerative joint diseases and arthritis are mentioned in

the report, as diseases that are apparently promoted by an increased Vitamin D intake.(15)

In a study done in England, Vitamin D obtained from the skin's exposure to sunlight

was far superior to that obtained from oral ingestion. (16) One can easily see that the best

source of Vitamin D is the natural one, SUNSHINE. No report in scientific literature has

ever shown that a toxic dose of Vitamin D has been obtained from sunlight.





SUNLIGHT AND PINEAL GLAND

Research conducted at the National Institute of Health has now revealed that a

smal gland near the center of the brain actual y responds to light entering the eye. This

response is independent of, and apart from, the normal visual process. Under Stimulation

of light entering the eye, this gland - cal ed the pineal gland -controls the synthesis and

release of chemical substances (hormones, enzymes) into the bloodstream to be carried

to any one of several target sites in the neuro-endocrine System including the brain, the

pituitary, and the gonads.(17)



SUNLIGHT DESTROYS BACTERIA

Skin blemishes can be improved with sunshine. When sweat glands become

plugged and infected, sunlight can help to sterilize the area. Dead cel s in the outer layer

of skin tend to plug up the sweat glands, and sunlight causes a faster removal of the outer

layer of skin, al owing the sweat glands to drain, and thus decreasing the congestion.

Wounds receiving sunlight treatments seem to heal faster, and have a much greater blood

supply.(18)

Exposure to sunlight aids in the skin's resistance to disease by kil ing those germs

that are on the surface of the skin. Ultraviolet wave lengths that reach the earth vary in

length. The shorter wave lengths of ultraviolet light are the ones that are more bactericidal,

penetrating the superficial layers of the skin and kil ing bacteria in those layers. Not only

does the sun have a direct bactericidal effect on the skin, but it also changes the oils in the

skin into bactericidal agents themselves. Even the vapor rising from natural skin oils (after

exposure to sunlight) are capable of kil ing bacteria.

Recent studies examining the value of ultraviolet light in the disinfection of water

showed that if the irradiation was sufficiently strong and the flow of water slow enough,

water could be purified satisfactorily. Scientists reporting the results of one study

concluded that the sun's ultraviolet rays are an important factor in the natural purification

of water because of their effectiveness in kil ing E. Coli. By testing water samples from a

marine sewage disposal, it was demonstrated that sunlight could kil the microorganism E.

Coli to depths of 12 feet in sea water. (19) In another study, done approximately 10 years

after the study just mentioned, waste stabilization ponds were exposed to sunlight, and

the researchers concluded that solar ultraviolet light is indeed an important, though

seldom appreciated factor, in the natural purification of water.(20)





SUNLIGHT AND SEX HORMONES

Our twenty-four hour days are divided into periods of light and darkness. This

division appears to play an important role in our hormone production. If this division of light

and dark is changed, it wil affect the hormone balance. Humans when kept in darkness,



31



such as children who are blind, wil become sexual y mature sooner than children who are

not blind.(21)

Americans over the past few decades have been moving from country living and

outdoor life into the cities and indoor factory or office life. Lighting indoors provides only

one-tenth as much light as out-of-doors in the shade. During this same period of time

when Americans have been moving indoors, the age when children become sexual y

mature has been decreasing.

Sunlight affects the hormonal balance of the body in two ways: by stimulating

glandular production when light passes through the eye into the brain, and by producing

hormones directly in the skin. When light enters the eye, it stimulates nerves in the back of

the eye to send Impulses to the spinal cord. From there the impulse is sent back into the

brain to a tiny organ cal ed the pineal gland. The pineal gland produces a hormone cal ed

melatonin. This hormone affects the brain and other glands such as the pituitary, adrenals,

ovaries, and testes. It also seems to have control of various glandular functions: for

example, it can stop the ovaries from ovulation and can delay sexual maturity. When

sunlight strikes the skin, it produces sex hormones in the skin itself Research reports

show that sunlight produces an estrogen-like substance in the skin which moves into the

blood. It elevates female hormones, but the male hormones are elevated to an even

greater degree. When the chest or back is exposed to sunlight, the male hormones may

increase by 120%.(22)



PLENTY OF SUNLIGHT GIVES US A SUNNY SPIRIT

Sun baths improve our general health, stimulate the appetite, give a feeling of wel -

being, and enable us to sleep at night. Next time you're under stress, go out for a walk in

the sunshine and watch what it wil do for you. Those who take advantage of the weather

by sunbathing find that the sun definitely has a tranquilizing effect, more than the effect

one obtains from just lying down and relaxing or resting. In a study done at the University

of Il inois the effects of sunlight treatments on Student behavior were

observed.



The students who were given the sunlight treatments showed

greater interest in their class work, attended classes more regularly and

felt more wide awake during the day. They voted unanimously to

continue sunlight treatments fol owing the experiment. It has been

shown that sunlight treatments actual y affect the brain and can help

balance the nerve impulses. Sunlight can alter the flow of hydrochloric

acid, which may be the reason stomach and duodenal ulcers respond

so favorably to light therapy. The adrenal glands contain more adrenaline fol owing

sunlight treatments, and this may account for one's increased ability to withstand stress

after such treatments. It has been shown that in certain areas where one has a limited

amount of sunshine, such as Alaska in the winter, there is a higher rate of suicides. For

Optimum health, live in a home that is located on high dry ground with plenty of Windows

and with shade trees kept far enough from the home to let in plenty of sunshine.

When the sun is permitted to shine on the skin it quickly Stores up a tremendous

amount of energy in the body. Mil ions of nerve endings absorb the radiant energy of the

sun and transmit this energy to the entire nervous System of the body. That is why one

feels so ful of energy and life after a sun bath. Generous amounts of sunshine do give

one a cheerful sunny disposition. Clients that I work with often comment on how great they

feel after a series of sunbaths.





32



SUNBATHING

A sunbath is best taken in the morning when the air is clear,

and the heat not too great. In the summer it may be taken as

early as eight o'clock. In cool weather, it may be taken later in

the forenoon. Care must be taken to prevent overheating or

chil ing. In order to avoid a sunburn it is necessary to start with

a short exposure and to increase the time gradual y on

fol owing days. The ultraviolet light is the light that has proven

to be the most health restoring. Unfortunately, it is also one

that is most easily eliminated by window glass, sunglasses or

clothing. The most important part of our body that the sun's ultraviolet rays need to reach

is our eyes. Sunglasses and regular glasses wil not let the ultraviolet rays (the healing

rays of the sun) reach the eyes. So, when you are sunbathing use no glasses-just close

your eyes and look at the sun with your eyes closed so the ultraviolet rays can penetrate

the eye lids. It would be good to do this a minimum of 10 minutes each day. This is

especial y good for women with a hormonal imbalance (during their monthly cycle), and

anyone with a nervous disorder. During sun bathing the amount of ultraviolet light

available depends upon the location of the earth and the season. The more atmosphere

the ultraviolet light must pass through the less there wil be to reach the earth. In the

winter there is less ultraviolet light available as the northern hemisphere is tilted away from

the sun; so the best time to sunbathe is between 10 AM and 2 PM. In the summer

ultraviolet light is available over a longer period of time, so it is best to sunbathe between

8 AM and 4 PM.





SUNBURN

During the sunbath you should feel good. There should be no feeling of depression or

discomfort. If, as a result of exposure to the sun, you feel weak, too warm, or there are

signs of headache, stop at once. The degree of injury to the skin depends on the

concentration of ultraviolet rays, the duration of the exposure, and the amount of pigment

within the skin of the individual. Blondes and redheads are particularly susceptible. On

repeated exposure to sunlight, most persons develop an increased amount of pigment in

the skin (suntan) and thus become less susceptible to sunburn while the excess

pigmentation lasts. Drugs, cosmetics and soaps can so sensitize the skin that burning

becomes a real problem. One should not be afraid of sweating, as the sweating process

cools the body and eliminates toxins. One has to take into consideration, when

sunbathing, the time of day, location, season of the year, latitude and elevation. Sun

burning can take place faster in mile high Denver, Colorado, than it can at sea level, for

the sun's rays have a mile less of atmosphere through which to pass. If one is sunbathing

at the beach, he wil probably burn faster than on the back lawn. The amount of ultraviolet

light reflected from the environment can make a big difference. Snow wil reflect about

86% of the ultraviolet, dry sand 17% and grass 2.5%. Water is a poor reflector of

ultraviolet light.



Reflection of the sun's rays by a clear, blue sky overhead, may double the effect of

the ultraviolet rays which come from the sun itself. One other thing to remember is that

wet skin wil burn more rapidly than dry skin. While sunbathing, use no kind of lotions,

creams, sun screening agents, etc. Sunscreens containing a tanning ingredient may

promote skin cancer. Lyle Cartwright, M.D. of the University of California Medical Center

at San Diego, found tumors and skin changes in laboratory mice that had been covered



33

with the tanning ingredient and exposed to sunlight. The researchers reported that 100%

of the mice, having sunscreen applications and a dose of sunlight equal to one hour of

midday sun in a temperate climate, developed tumors. Mice, not treated with sunscreen,

but given large doses of sunshine, did not develop tumors. (American Medical News, June

24,1983, pg.18). Clean skin is the best for sunbathing. Natural sunshine is best for

sunbathing. There are no sun lamps made that can match our natural sun. Some are

different from the sunlight and may actual y be harmful. Light is a nutrient much like food;

and, like food, the wrong kind can make us il , and the right kind can keep us wel .





SUNSCREENS/TUMORS

Urocanic acid, found in sun screens, body lotions, foundations or make-up bases, may

trigger or stimulate growth of skin tumors. Laboratory animals exposed to sunlamps after

the applications of urocanic acid had four times more tumors than those not treated with

urocanic acid. (Medical Tribune, April 18, 1991)

NATURAL FOODS





"Let your food be your medicine and your medicine be your food"

Hippocrates



What are natural foods? They are foods that are natural, such as apples, potatoes,

corn, almonds, etc. They have no added artificial flavorings, colors, or preservatives; and

they are foods that are not refined, such as white flour or corn oil.



142 YEAR OLD MAN

In 1980, the Los Angeles Times and Weekly World News carried articles about Wu

Yunging, a man who lived in China. Mr. Yunging was an extraordinary person, for he was

142 years old. What do you suppose his diet consisted of? He said that he eats corn, rice,

sweet potatoes, fruits and vegetables. In other words, he eats no meat, milk, eggs, refined

oils, sugars, etc. He had reached the age of 142 because he ate the kind of foods that

God original y gave to mankind to eat in the Garden of Eden. These foods were fruits,

nuts, grains and vegetables or herb bearing seeds.



DIET IS THE MAJOR CAUSE OF DISEASE

A 712 page report, issued by the U.S. Surgeon General in 1979, which cites more

than 2,000 scientific studies from around the world and was compiled with the advice of

more than 200 doctors, nutritionists and biochemists, came to the conclusion that the

normal American diet is dangerous. Of the 2.1 mil ion Americans who died the report said

that 1.5 mil ion died from diseases associated with diet. The report brought out that most

people should reduce the consumption of fat, especial y saturated fats, such as from eggs,

butter or untrimmed red meat. It suggests more vegetables and fruits, more whole grain

foods, and cereal products. The report recommends that dried beans and peas be used

as a source of protein to replace some animal products. Dietary fat, the report said

increases risks for obesity, some types of cancer, gal bladder and heart disease. The

report also said excess cholesterol levels, strongly associated with heart attacks, should



35





be reduced by limiting consumption of foods of animal origin, such as eggs, dairy

products, meat, poultry and fish.

Our refined food is now kil ing us on the instal ment plan. More than 4,000 heart

attacks occur every day in the United States. Every 50 seconds a new diabetic is

discovered. Half of al Americans over 40 have high blood pressure. These diseases are

not found in 75% of the world's population. Why? Because Americans like to eat; they eat

too much; and they eat the wrong kinds of foods such as meat, milk, eggs, sugar, oil,

refined and processed foods.

"You are what you eat, Natural food, unadulterated, just as it

comes from the Creator, is the food that gives energy, health and

life. Refined food on the other hand, brings fatigue, sickness and

death. Yet man has tried to improve (is that possible?) upon the

natural food God has given us.

What should Americans be eating in order to stay healthy?

Simply this "the more natural the food, the better", whole wheat

flour instead of bleached white flour; brown rice, instead of white rice; fresh peaches,

instead of canned peaches; beans and nuts instead of meat; dried figs instead of a candy

bar, etc.



HARMFUL FOODS THAT DESTROY YOUR HEALTH

There is such a large variety of good natural foods that it would be very time

consuming to try and mention them al . But there are such a limited amount of unnatural

foods that I shal list the majority of them that most Americans use and then proceed to

explain why they are harmful to the body and should not be

Used.

Group I - Al kinds of meats, this includes chicken and fish.



Group II - Al animal products: cheese, ice cream and eggs. (milk covered in

another chapter )

Group III - Alcohol, coffee, tea, colas, chocolate, baking powder, and soda

(covered in another Chapter)

Group IV - Al spices such as pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc.

Group V - Al refined oils.

Group VI - Al refined sugars, such as corn syrup, date sugar, etc. (covered in

another chapter).



Group VII Al refined grains, such as white flour, white rice, etc.

Group VIII Al vitamin and mineral Supplements (covered in another chapter).



After covering these harmful foods and how they hurt the body the last section of

this chapter wil be on simple rules for eating natural foods.



GROUP I - ALL KINDS OF MEAT

Man's Body Was Not Designed To Eat Meat. Let's look at some simple

physiological aspects of meat eating. A carnivore's teeth are long, sharp, and pointed for

ripping and tearing flesh. Man has molars for crushing and grinding.

A carnivore's jaw moves up and down only, for tearing and biting.

Man's moves up and down and from side to side for grinding. A

carnivore's tongue is rough; man's is smooth. A

carnivore's saliva is acid and geared to the



36





digestion of animal protein. Man's saliva is alkaline for the digestion of starch. A

carnivore's intestines are three times the length of its trunk, designed for rapid expulsion of

food stuff, which would otherwise quickly rot. Man's intestines are twelve times the length

of his trunk and designed to keep food in them until al nutrients are extracted. The liver

and kidneys of a carnivore are capable of eliminating large amounts of uric acid whereas

man's liver and kidneys have the capacity to eliminate only a smal amount of uric acid. A

carnivore's urine is acid. Man's is alkaline.



Consider the elephant. How much dead flesh does he eat?

none, and an elephant can live for over a hundred years because

he is a vegetarian. Whereas, carnivorous animals, such as a cat,

or dog live anywhere from 10-15 years. What are the strongest

animals in the world? The ones used for centuries because of their

endurance and strength: elephants, water buffalo, camels, mules,

and horses; and they al have this one thing in common, they are

vegetarians. A lion, which exclusively eats flesh has very little endurance, for he sleeps

approximately 20 hours a day.



PESTICIDES IN FOOD

The presence of at least some pesticide residues in food is an inescapable fact of

life. Plant foods are much lower in pesticide residues than meat and other animal

products. Dairy products general y contain two-fifths the pesticide residues found in meat;

leafy vegetables contain only one twenty-fourth the pesticides found in meat. Nathaniel

Altman's - Total Vegetarian Cooking, p. 21, 1981.



MORE BACTERIA IN MOST MEAT THAN IN MANURE

Meat is dead flesh, and something that is dead should be buried and not put into

our stomachs. Flavor in meat is due to the presence of uric acid that

is in the meat. What is uric acid? It is one of the waste or excretory

products of the body, or simply said, it is the urine of the animal. Uric

acid is not the only thing about meat that is bad. Another thing wrong

is the putrefactive bacteria found in meat. The bacteria in meats are

identical in character with those of manure and are more numerous

in some meats than in fresh manure. A microscopic count has been made of bacteria

found in meats of various kinds, so that people may know what they are getting when they

eat meat (1) See chart.

HIGH MEAT DIET (WHICH IS ALSO HIGH IN FAT) IS MAJOR CAUSE OF HEART

ATTACKS, STROKES, AND CANCER

Meat is an incomplete source of nutrition. As a consequence, reliance on a meat

based diet actual y becomes a liability to human health. But meat is not only a liability for

what it does not contain; it is also a liability for what it does contain; excess protein, fat,

cholesterol, and blood, besides worms, microbes, and cancer viruses. (2)

Over three out of every four people in this country die of cardiovascular disease,

(heart attacks & strokes) or cancer. We haven't always died so massively of heart attacks,

strokes and cancer until after World War I, when we could afford high fat diets of meat,

fish, poultry, eggs and processed foods. Back in 1960, sufficient research evidence was

available to prompt an editorial Statement in the Journal of American Medical Association

which said, a vegetarian diet can prevent 90% of our thrombo-embolic disease (blood

clotting diseases of the head, heart and legs) and 97% of our coronary occlusions. (3)

Nearly everyone knows that Americans today eat too much fat. Around 40-45% of

the calories eaten in the average American diet is from fat. Meat, especial y red meat, is

the single largest source of fat in the U. S. diet. For percentages of fat in certain animal

products, see accompanying chart.



Animal Product

Fat Content (% of total calories)

Steak

65 â€“ 80%

Lamb

75%

Ham

80%

Hot Dog

85%

Whole Milk

50%

Cheese

60 â€“ 85%

Cream Cheese

90%



The Dietary Guideline Advisory Committee has proposed to limit fat intake to 10% of

the calorie intake in 1990. The American Heart Association was total y in support of these

new guidelines. If the American people would reduce their fat intake to 10%, we would see

a large decrease in heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and cancer.



FAT AND CANCER

Populations with a high incidence of cancer were always consuming high fat diets.

The U.S. Academy of Sciences in Washington, D. C., says, "Of al the dietary factors that

have been associated epidemiological y with cancers of various sites, fat has probably

been studied most thoroughly and produced the greatest frequency of direct associations."

In 2005 over 510,000 people in the United States, died of cancer, 1,397 people a day, or

one every 62 seconds. The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society

have now clearly shown that the incidence of several cancers increases with the amount

of meat and fatty foods consumed.(3) Women who eat meat daily have nearly four times as

much breast cancer as those who use meat less than once per week. (5)

Fats elevate serum cholesterol and impede circulation leading to strokes and heart

attacks. Fats increase the chances of getting cancer. Fats increase the chances of getting

diabetes. Fats reduce muscular endurance. Animals store poisons in their fats. Fats delay

digestion. Fats are fattening.

CANCEROUS ANIMALS SOLD FOR FOOD

Despite growing evidence of similar cancer viruses in man and animals, animals

with malignancies are stil al owed to be sold by merely removing the obvious cancer area.

Each year mil ions of cattle are sold for food that had malignant eye tumors when

slaughtered. Nevertheless, after condemning only the heads, the carcasses

were sold for food. It is not possible for al the meat stamped, "Grade A

Inspected", to have been inspected. One processing plant in Georgia,

processes 85,000 chickens per day with eight inspectors. That would require

each man to "inspect" more than 10,000 chickens in a day.

Ralph Nader charges that the United States Department of Agriculture

favors big "agribusiness", and therefore fails to protect otherwise defenseless Americans

from bad meat, contaminated poultry and toxic pesticides. In most states, nearly

unmonitored inspectors tend to be subjected, both to intimidation and bribes. As a result,

they routinely approve for processing "4-D" animals - that is, animals that were dead,

dying, diseased and disabled. (6).





CHICKENS â€“ DONÂ´T EAT THEM





Chickens today are commercial y raised on many drugs! They are cramped into very smal

crates; they are not permitted to touch the ground or exercise; and they are ful of

diseases, especial y cancer. Chickens bought by consumers are heavily contaminated by

intestinal microorganisms from the animals, chiefly E. Coli. If the chickens have been fed

antibiotics, those germs are usual y resistant to antibiotics .(7) In addition to antibiotics and

contagious infections, sometimes, chickens are subjected to contaminated feed. Chickens

and eggs were contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls in Idaho and Montana in 1979.



FISH - GOOD FOR THE FISH BOWL. BUT NOT FOR YOU

Many fish are ful of toxic chemicals that have been dumped into our lakes and

oceans. Human viruses present in contaminated water are now found

in fish, and can be carried to man without infecting the fish in the

transaction. These organisms have been found in unprecedented

numbers, and include human polio viruses, cox sackie viruses and
