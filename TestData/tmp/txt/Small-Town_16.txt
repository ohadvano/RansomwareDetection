“Stop it!”
I beg and beg for him to stop, but he only carries on. “What's going on out here?”
Not only has Ryder stopped shouting, but his whole body stiffens when he notices Terry standing with a flashlight pointed right at him. “He giving you trouble, Alice?”
I take my hands away from my ears and shake my head. “No, he was just leaving.”
Ryder looks back at with me desperation in his eyes, but I can't listen to another word he has to say.
“Goodnight Terry.” I walk away, leaving both men standing alone in the dark.
The walk to my home was surprisingly peaceful. There were no run-ins with Ryder nor an encounter with a wolf. Just me and the sounds of nature. I hear the blood-curdling screams of the wild fox and the loud belching of the red deer stags in the night.
I take the shortcut home and come across the clearing of the forest that stands between me and my home. I believe that many secrets are in this forest, but I feel no threat nor am I afraid to know what hides inside it.
As I stand at the clearing, I feel nothing but power. I've experienced the feeling of becoming close to death, and I couldn't feel more alive.
I dash through the forest and leap over the thin winding creeks and the slippery rocks. I dodge and zip past rotting oak trees and under lowered branches. Bugs zip in and out of my ears, humming and buzzing their little song. Green leaves, yellow leaves and red leaves scatter on the ground like a rainbow of rich, autumnal colours. Ahead, the forest trees get thinner.
I'm close to home.
As I draw closer, I see the old worn bridge that leads to the road opposite my home.
Home sweet home.
I live with my mother in a quiet residential area in a beautiful detached house. It's been the only home I've ever lived in, and there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be because of the silence and peacefulness the house provides. The house has a big garden with beautiful trees, plants and even a swimming pool. The house is pretty spacious for only the two of us, with two floors and a smaller third floor with big windows.
The gate is on the ground floor where the big hall communicates with two comfortable airy living rooms, a bathroom, and a modern large kitchen is placed in the heart of the house. One living room has a door that leads out to the terrace that overlooks the garden. On the first floor are four rooms which consist of two doubles and two singles with two bathrooms.
My mother sleeps in the main bedroom which has its own bathroom and her own balcony.
I walk across the road and reach the wraparound porch in front of the house, and turn the handle to see that it's locked.
Mum should be home by now.
I tap my knuckles on the pristine glass door, and wait for any sign of movement.
I tap again and wait a few minutes longer. Nothing.
I move to check underneath the doormat and see the lone silver key.
I guess she's not home.
I pick up the key and enter the house, “Mum? Are you home?”
Not once did she answer me when I called her. Maybe she had a date tonight?
I take the stairs down into the kitchen, and notice a piece of paper stuck on the refrigerator.
Alice,
Got called down to the hospital, Probably won't be home till morning, Supper is in the microwave
Love you, Mum x
I guess that adds up to where she is.
I open the microwave and groan in satisfaction when I smell the sweet aroma of the pepperoni pizza.
My mother knows me too well.
Before I change out of my clothes and into my nightwear, I reheat the pizza and grab myself a can of coke.
By the time I come down the stairs, I take the pizza and can over to the sofa in front of the TV, and download the season finale of Game of Thrones.
Again, questions rush inside my head.
What if what Ryder says is true? That I'm changing into one of the most dangerous predators known to humans?
Whatever happens to me, the last thing I want to do is hurt somebody. I'd never forgive myself if I did.
I come out of my trance to the opening theme of Game of Thrones when suddenly everything in the room starts to blur. I can't see anything.
I wipe my eyes with the palm of my hands to feel that my face is burning.
I hear my heart beating rapidly inside my chest, and I start to notice that I'm struggling to breathe properly.
I stand on my feet to work my way towards the bathroom when suddenly I feel a stabbing pain in my stomach. It was like my insides were being twisted and pulled.
I pull the bathroom door open and balance myself on the sink.
I look in the mirror to see myself completely drenched in sweat.
Oh no...It's happening! What do I do!?
My head starts to throb as the pain in my stomach becomes too excruciating to cope with.
The more I try to stop the agonizing pain, I feel the most intense agony searing into my lower back, and all I can do is scream.
The pain becomes worse whenever I try to fight it, and straight away I feel nausea creeping up my throat. I double over and vomit violently to see black liquid coating the edges of the toilet.
I lose count of the amounts of time I vomit, but I refuse to stop fighting.
I refuse to change.
I don't care how long the pain takes, I won't give in to the change.
After what feels like intense hours, I sigh in relief as I rest my cheekbone on the cold surface of the toilet. My vision was starting to clear ever so slowly. The pain in my stomach, and lower back have subsided, and I can finally breathe again. My heart beats to its normal two-beat rhythm, and my head stops throbbing.
With unsteady legs, I get up from the position on the toilet and clean the bathroom from top to bottom.
After I finish cleaning, I sit on the floor and promise myself to only rest my eyes for a couple of minutes.
I don't hear the door open, nor do I hear my mother calling my name several times. She finds me exactly as I am sitting on the floor with my head resting on the toilet. I open my eyes and look at her.
“Alice honey, what are you doing on the floor?” She looks at me with worry in her eyes.
She stands by the bathroom door in her pink scrubs, holding her black knitted cardigan in her arms.
“I got sick.”
My mother kneels down on the floor in front of me and places her hand on my forehead.
“Did you catch a fever or something?”
“Yeah, maybe.”
'Right, well I think you should rest and drink plenty of water, and I'll call the doctor tomorrow if you want before I go to work, okay honey? No school for you tomorrow.”
She kisses me on the forehead and helps me slowly off the floor.
“How was work?” I follow my mother into the kitchen, and sit on the bar stool as she turns off the TV.
I've missed Game of Thrones. Again.
“Work was a little hectic but I'm happy to be home. Everything okay in school?”' She brings the uneaten pizza, and the unopened can of coke, into the kitchen and sets them on the counter.
“School was okay I guess. We have a new English teacher.”
“A new teacher? What happened to Mr. Daniels?” “I don't know. Maybe he quit?”
I don't know why I didn't tell my mother about Mr. Daniels, but I don't think telling her that he was supposedly found ripped to shreds in his home a good idea.
Who knows? Maybe Ryder only told me that to scare me?
“Well that's a shame. He was such a good teacher and he adored you.”
“I know, but.” I shrug my shoulders and stand to give my mother a hug. “Goodnight mom.”
She squeezes me tightly as she kisses the top of my head. “Goodnight honey. I love you.”
“Love you too.”
I walk up the stairs into my bedroom and lean my head against the door.
I actually did it, I did not change into a wolf.
I laugh hysterically to myself, feeling a great amount of triumph.
My body feels incredibly weak and drained after the events of last night and tonight, but at least the vomiting has stopped.
A part of me feels relieved that I won't have to face Ryder tomorrow, but the other part of me wants to tell him what happened here tonight.
He did tell me though that if I fought the change the first time, I'm less likely to survive the next change.
Chapter 5

Early the next morning, I wake up to my mother asking me if she needs to phone the doctor for me, but I decide to go back to sleep when I tell her that I was feeling better.
She kissed me goodbye and left for work soon after.
I don't wake up till late afternoon and when I do, I wake up to see five missed calls from Sam.
Great.
I sit up and dial her phone number, she answers immediately.
“Fucking finally! She's alive!” I hear her laughing on the other end.
“Very funny Sam.” I get up from the bed and walk downstairs into the kitchen to prepare myself breakfast.
“I'm sorry, I just wanted to know where my partner in crime was.”
“I'm at home. Didn't feel well last night.”
I open the cupboard, grab the loaf of bread and put one in the toaster.
“Did you get sick or something?”
“Yeah and guess what, mum found me on the edge of the toilet seat. She told me to stay home and sleep it off.”
“Okay your mum sucks for telling you that, but I guess if you aren't feeling well, then the best place for you to be is at home.”
“I guess, but I'm totally feeling fine right now. How's school?”
I hear nothing but silence on the other end. “Sam?” I warm up the kettle, take the toast out of the toaster and start spreading the butter.
I look to see if she accidentally pressed the end call button, but call her name again when I see that she hasn't. “Sam?”
“Ryder keeps staring at me and it's really creepy.” She whispers into the phone.
“What do you mean?” I grab myself a mug from the cupboard, make myself a cup of tea and sit down on the brown leather sofa.
“Well I'm sitting next to Alex who sits at the back of the class because he knows all the answers, and I don't know why but Ryder keeps looking at me.”
“Well, maybe he fancies you?” I question her but I only mean it as a joke.
“Cut the crap Alice. We both know that's not true.” Sam spits in disgust.
“How would you know?”
“Because he couldn't take his eyes off you at the diner.”
Yeah for all the wrong reasons!
“Look, just ask him why he's staring at you. It's not like he's going to bite.” I stifle a giggle.
If only she knew.
Sam groans. “Yeah, I'd rather not do that. Look I gotta go. Mr Jackson just came in.'
“Alright, have fun in Math.”
“Fuck you, I'll see you after school.” “Okay, see you soon.”
When I end the call, I look around the house and wonder what to do in the spare time that I have before Sam comes over.
I look up at the clock to see that it's 12:30, school finishes at 3:30.
I decide to make Sam proud and watch the season finale of Game of Thrones.
As the opening credits start, I can't help but feel sad that another season has come to its end. It makes me think back to when Sam and I met when we started out as freshmen. We were seated next to each other in our English class when Mr. Daniels told us to introduce ourselves and share to each other which one character in the whole world we wanted to be. When Sam told me who she wanted to be, she instantly became my best friend because she wanted to be Arya Stark. It was one of the happiest moments of my life because I wanted to be Daenerys Targaryen; The Mother of Dragons herself. We spent our first day as freshman talking about Game of Thrones, and we've been best friends ever since.
As I watch the show and see Arya Stark training with The Waif in the House of Black and White, all I can see is Sam. A long stern face, grey eyes and short brown hair.
Skinny but athletic. Where Arya gets mistaken for looking like a boy, Sam ignores the attention from the boys in our school. She can't think of anything worse than dating a guy from high school.
When the end credits of the show roll on the black screen, all I can think about is how I'm going to cope without having this show to watch every Sunday. Maybe I should start watching something like Prison Break or True Blood? True Blood has wolves in it so I'm not gonna watch that, and Prison Break?
Maybe I'll consider it.
I look again at the clock to see that it's 2:30.
An hour till Sam gets here!
I decide to put on a blue flannel shirt and some denim shorts leaving my feet bare. With only a few minutes to spare, I wash and dry the dishes, mop and hoover the floor and wipe down all the surfaces in the house.
By the time I put the hoover and mop in the storage closet, I hear a knock on the door.
I walk casually to it, open it to find Sam looking miserable at me.
“What's with the long face?”
She rushes past me and face-plants into the sofa. “I just had to endure the whole day with creepy stares coming from Ryder and his stupid gang all day!”
I laugh softly and move to sit in front of her on the coffee table.
“Did you ask him why he was staring at you?”
She turns her head to look at me and shakes her head. “Nope. He freaks me out, and it wasn't just him staring, it was all of them.”
I can only shrug. “I don't know what to say.”
Sam frowns. “Do you think maybe they were trying to lip read me?”
“What makes you think that?”
“Well, when I was sitting in the cafeteria, they were all staring at me like they were waiting for something. And then again in Math, I was talking to you on the phone and Ryder would not stop looking at me, and he doesn't even have Math!”
Maybe I should tell Sam about what happened last night at the diner, I want to involve her in on what goes on in my life.
“Maybe they were staring because they kind of ambushed me last night after work.”
She shrieks, “What!?”
“I was ambushed by the four of them after work except for Kellan, he stayed out of the confrontation part, but the rest of them interrogated me about the night I was bitten.”
Sam moves to lie on her side with a confused expression on her face. “Why would they want to know about what happened to you that night?”
Before I can respond to her question, I hear a knock on the door and see Sam frowning at me.
“Are you expecting someone?” “No, just you.”
We both look towards the door and wait.
“Should I go answer it?” I ask. “Maybe it's someone for my mum?”
“Leave it.” Sam grabs the remote off the coffee table and turns on the TV.
“Sam, I can't just leave whoever's out there waiting. I'll be right back.”
I hear Sam murmur something under her breath, but it's too quiet for me to hear what she said.
I walk briskly to the front door and can't believe my eyes who I see on the other side. I stare at him open-mouthed.
“Didn't think I'd find you?” Ryder's hip leans against the door jamb.
I step outside and shut the door behind me.
“What the hell are you doing here!?” I spit. “How did you find me!?”
“I came over to apologize about last night.” “How did you find me!?”' I repeat.
'You know the answer to that question. Besides, I had to check on you.” He frowns and shakes his head, “Something's wrong with your scent.”
“What do you mean?”
“It's different. Like it's receding.”
He looks at me in confusion. “Did something happen to you last night, Alice?”
I don't say a word.
He backs me up against the wall next to the door and places his palm next to my face. “I won't ask you again. If something happened to you then I need to know.”
I bite my lip and look away from him. “I think you better leave.”
“I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what happened.”
“You want to know what happened? Fine. I fought the change.”
A few seconds pass by when suddenly Ryder punches the wall right next to me. I shrink back against the wall.
“Why do something when I told you to do the fucking opposite!? Did you not listen to a word I said to you last night?”
“I fought the change because I didn't want to become a monster.” I move his arm to slip past. “Like you and the others.”
I walk back inside the house just as I hear Ryder's loud piercing roar coming from outside.
A shiver runs down my spine.
When I reach the living room, I see that Sam hasn't moved from her position on the sofa, but she soon hears my footsteps just as I sit in the armchair.
“Who was it?”
“None other than the creeper himself.”
Sam's eyes shift to me in a heartbeat. “Ryder's here?” “Yeah, I left him outside.”
One minute Sam's lying on the sofa and the next she's out the door.
By the time I get up from the chair and rush outside onto the porch, I notice five figures in total. I see Sam and Ryder at each other's throats spitting insults to each other, but then I notice three beautiful wolves standing behind Ryder in a protective stance.
Is that Bane, Silver and Kellan? No...That's impossible.
I ignore Sam and Ryder arguing and turn to look at each wolf individually.
The smaller one out of the three has icy, cold blue eyes and razor sharp teeth. Fur the colour of ash that looks soft and well kept. The hairs at the back of the neck are erect, clearly indicating its anger. It growls as it looks at Sam but does not strike once.
Next to the grey wolf stands a much bigger wolf. Dark brown coats its entire body like a rough silk blanket, with a speck of white running down its narrow chest, its eyes the colour of the brightly lit sky and razor-sharp teeth.
But the last wolf doesn't join in with the other wolves. It stares directly at me as I stand by the door, and I don't know why but something tells me that this wolf held no threat. I had a feeling in my gut telling me exactly who it was. Kellan.
His coat is so light it could appear as pure gold, but his eyes are yellow.
That's odd. .Why are the eyes different?
I reach out with my hand towards Kellan. He slowly approaches me, inhales and nudges my hand with his head. His coat feels incredibly smooth like silk. As I stroke him, I feel completely mesmerised to think that a part of Kellan is somewhere inside this magnificent predator.
I stare at the scene in front of me, Ryder and Sam stand inches away from each other, and it sounds to me like Sam's giving him complete hell after what happened last night.
I do the only thing I can think of and grab Sam by the wrist, and pull her back to where I stand by the door. “Alright, that's enough from both of you!”
The two wolves move to stand on either side of Ryder while Kellan stands beside me. Ryder gives the two wolves next to him a sign for them to stop growling, and they do instantly.
“Who the fuck do you think you are!? You had no right interrogating her like that!” Sam shrieks.
Ryder looks at Sam with distaste. “Everything she does concerns me!” He points at me. “Did she tell you what happened to her last night?”
“What are you talking about?' Sam frowns and looks at me, 'Alice?”
“Tell her how you fought the change, and that you're most likely gonna die the next time.”
Sam gasps. “Alice, is this true?”
“Only because I didn't want to become a monster!' I seethe angrily towards Ryder and stand in front of him, both wolves start growling again.
“I've asked you to leave once. I won't ask you again.” Ryder smirks. “Are you threatening me, Alice?” “Yes.”
I look into his eyes but freeze when I see that his eyes have turned bright red.
He cups my cheek and whispers in my ear. “You really shouldn't threaten an Alpha.”
Chapter 6

I stand there rooted to the ground, unable to look away from his eyes, the eyes of an Alpha.
Everything around me doesn't exist as I stare into the eyes of a predator, and right now Ryder looks at me like a predator watching its prey.
I pull his hand away from my cheek, walk tentatively to grab Sam's hand and pull her behind me.
“Leave us alone.”
Ryder shakes his head. “I can't do that. I need you to tell me what happened last night because something has definitely changed. After you tell me what I need to know, then I'll leave.”
I grit my teeth. “I'm not telling you anything.”
Before I have a chance to finish talking, the two wolves standing next to Ryder shift into human forms.
Both Bane and Silver stand completely naked. “What the hell!?” I hear Sam gasp behind me. I turn around to see that Kellan has shifted too. Wow.
I take in his whole appearance but blush when my eyes finally meet his.
Shit!
He totally caught me checking him out. I clear my throat and turn to face Ryder.
“Why don't we just beat it out of her?” Bane growls.
Silver curls her arm around Ryder's waist, pressing her chest seductively against his arm. “I'll do it, Ryder, I'll give you what you want.”
She looks at me and smirks.
Ryder pulls Silver's hand away and walks towards me in his black wife-beater and ripped jeans, he stands in front of me. “Tell me everything and I'll leave.”
His eyes are back to emerald green. “Please.”
I gently nod and turn to open the door only to be met with Sam's wide-eyed stare, and her mouth wide open.
I look back to what she's staring at but only see that she's looking at Bane.
I quietly giggle to myself and poke Sam in the ribs before she gets caught. She instantly closes her mouth and clears her throat, murmuring a quiet thank you when she passes to enter the house. Silver soon follows after Ryder but not before she nudges me with her shoulder to pass. Bane says nothing as he follows with a sneer on his face.
I turn to see that Kellan's stopped in front of me with a warm smile painted on his face.
“That's where it bit you?” He points at my shoulder. On instinct, I touch it. “Yeah.”
“I promise that whoever did this to you won't live to see another day.”
“Thank you.” I sigh. “I haven't really thought about that night.”
“It's a lot to take in I know, but you'll realize with your new abilities what amazing things you can do.”
I smile. “You know, I never thanked you for last night. You stepped in and stopped Bane from hurting me.”
He shrugs. “Don't mention it. I only did what I thought was right.”
“I know but thanks. It meant a lot to me.”
As the both of us turn to enter the house, Ryder stands in the hall with his hands in his pockets, looking at the two of us curiously. He indicates with his head to the living room.
When I enter the living room, I see that Bane and Silver have taken place on the sofa covered in Afghans thanks to Sam who sits in the armchair. She's still looking at Bane again with a huge grin on her face. Ryder takes his place standing by the window, while Kellan remains by my side.
I leave the room to grab Kellan a spare blanket but when I return I notice that nobody has said a word.
After what feels like hours of intense silence, Sam decides to break the ice.
“Alright, what the hell is going on?”
When nobody answers, she looks at me questioningly.
“Alice?”
Here goes nothing.
I look around the room to see that everyone's looking at me expectantly. “Last night at the diner.” I gulp and look away from everyone. “I heard Bane threaten our regular Paul, for staring at all of you, and I knew something was wrong when I was able to hear everything.”
I look towards Bane to see him staring at me with the same sneer still on his face.
“Then, the milkshake incident that you all saw. I'm certain that the time slowed itself down for me to catch it. If that weren't possible that milkshake would have been all over the floor.'
Ryder sighs loud enough for everyone in the room to hear. “We all know about what happened at the diner. Quit stalling. I want to know why you fought the change?”
Sam turns to Ryder with an annoyed expression on her face. “Back the hell off and stop rushing her.”
Silver growls from her seat on the sofa that instantly makes Sam turn to her. “And you? Quit acting like a bitch in heat and shut up.”
Kellan grabs a hold of my hand and calls my name silently, I look at him to see worry etched on his face, “You don't have to tell us anything if you don't want to.”
“Yes, she does.” Ryder scoffs. “If we have any chance of knowing how to catch whoever's murdering people in this town then yes, she has to tell us everything!”
“Whoever bit her might not even be responsible for the murders!” Kellan yells back.
“What murders?”
Everyone in the room ignores Sam again. “For God's sake! Someone, please answer me!”
Ryder clears his throat. “There's been a few murders in this town that have been kept on the down low. Major signs of animal attacks. We don't know who's responsible for the murders or why they're killing these people, but the number of bodies are piling up and the murderer knows how to cover its tracks. The four of us have tried finding a scent at every crime scene, but we never catch the scent.”
“Are you positive the attacks are caused by a wolf?” Sam asks.
“Of course we are you gormless prat!” Silver spits, “Kellan's father's a cop and he tells everything to his son. All murders are the same, bodies ripped to shreds. What kind of animal can do that? A wolf, and so far it's been five bodies. Mr Daniels was the fifth victim. We're recognizing a pattern so it's not just some random killing spree.”
“What's the pattern?” I ask quietly.
“One body every month.” Bane murmurs. “There's no way in hell we're gonna catch this fucker.”
A man of few words.
“Look if it helps either of you, I could describe to you what the wolf looked like.”
“It won't matter.” Ryder sighs. “You see, when you change for the first time, you're introduced to new abilities. Strength, Sound and Scent.” He turns to face the whole room. “Wolves can hide their scent after a long period of time, but only highly experienced wolves can do it. Whoever bit you can do exactly that. When I passed you in the hall, I could smell the venom in your body, but no scent of the wolf that bit you. The scent disappears if you fight the change, and you did. See, if you would've let your body change, you would have been able to identify that bond an Alpha does with its Beta. The chances of you finding that bond now is zero.”
“Ryder I was only trying to help.”
I'm starting to feel sick and tired of being talked to like a child. I knew the consequences of what fighting the change would mean to me, but if the chances were that whoever did bite me is the one killing people, then why all of a sudden do I feel so guilty? It's not like I owe these guys anything.
“Your help means jack shit to us.” Silver sneers at me. “I'm done here.”
Silver stands from her seating position, drops the blanket and crouches on the floor.
She turns her head to look at Ryder. “See you back at the house.”
Silver doesn't wait for his response. Instead, her whole body starts to change into its wolf form. I can hear and see the bones in her body changing, and the whole process seems to fascinate me.
As soon as she changes, she walks towards the double doors that lead out to the garden. Silver waits by the door for Ryder to open it. He cups her face, strokes her gently before opening the door.
Ryder walks towards me and stands in front of me.
“You may not have been bitten by either one of us, but the wolf that bit you seems to have not claimed you as being part of its pack. Perhaps if you joined a pack, your Alpha might find you and claim you back. Now, I'll consider having you being a part of my pack but I'm guessing that's gonna be a problem seeing as two of my Betas can't stand you.”
“Wait, who said anything about being in your pack? Or any pack for that matter?”
“Alice, you're gonna need a pack. An Omega rarely survives on its own. You could get killed.”
“Why would I wanna be in a pack that doesn't even want me? I'd rather stay on my own and live my life like a normal person.”
Why can't things go back to the way they were? “What's an Omega?” Asks Sam.
Kellan clears his throat and pulls the blanket around him tighter. “You have three rankings of a wolf. Alpha, Beta and Omega. Alpha's are considered to be the most powerful, strongest and lethal.” He points at Ryder. “Ryder's the Alpha as we all know.”
Kellan points at Bane. “Bane and Silver are the Beta's of the pack. Betas are the second in command. When the Alpha dies one of the Betas take over. Then you have the Omega. the Lone wolf to be exact. Omegas are considered to being weaker than the Beta's. Wolves can become Omegas by choice or sometimes they can be forced to leave the pack.”
Kellan places his hands gently on my shoulders, “Alice, I advise you to think about Ryder's offer. You won't survive on your own.”
I take his hands away from me. “I can take care of myself.”
I walk towards my front door hoping they get the idea that I want them to leave. Kellan leaves first without a word, Bane follows with an expressionless look on his face while Ryder meets me by the door with a scowl on his face.
“Why don't you ever listen?” He crosses his arms over his chest.
“What?”
“You never listen to anything anyone ever tells you. I'm trying to help you! You have no idea what's coming to you! Have you thought about what this change might do to you? What about your mother? How is she gonna cope?”
“Stop it! I'm sick of you acting like you're already my Alpha! I don't want to be in your pack! So, stick your offer and shove it up your ass!”
“Alice!”
I turn to look outside to see my mother standing in the drive.
Great.
“Sorry, mother.”
I can't believe this is happening. Hopefully, Ryder will disappear into thin air before my mother sees him.
“I raised you better than that Alice.”' She looks at Ryder with a huge smile on her face. “And who's this striking young man?”
Is she checking him out?
Gross!
“He was just leaving.” “Alice!”
I sigh. “Mum, this is Ryder, Ryder this is my mother”
“Lovely to meet you.” He can act being humble all he wants, but I wonder if he can actually speak a whole sentence without sounding like a moody son of a bitch.
“Likewise.” I look at Ryder and motion for him to leave.
“Right it's getting kinda late. I'll see you tomorrow at school.”
“No, you fucking won't.” I mutter.
Mother swirls around, “Who are you, and what have you done to my daughter?”
I don't see Ryder off, and head back into the living room where I see that Sam hasn't moved from her position on the couch.
“I feel like I've been mind blown.” Sam wheezes. “I can't believe I looked at Bane's crotch and I'm not even sorry!”
“Sam I think you're overreacting.” “How? Did you even look Alice?”
“I refuse to take part in this conversation.” I turn off the TV, walk into the kitchen where I see my mother making herself coffee.
“Hi, Tina.” Sam joins me in the kitchen and sits on the counter.
“Sam, how are you?”
“You know what? I'm very good. I've been completely mind blown from seeing the size of a man's penis today.”
I groan in embarrassment just as my mother bursts out laughing.
“Sam, please leave.” I plead.
“Alright, I better go before Alice starts combusting and hates me forever.” She waves and leaves out the front door.
My mother chuckles. “She's a funny one isn't she?” “Or delusional.”
“Well, I'm going to turn in early honey, I'm completely exhausted.”
My mother tips the rest of the coffee down the sink and kisses me on the cheek. “I love you.”
“Love you too, Mum.”
I look at the clock to see its 8:30 and decide to turn in too. It's been one hell of a long day.
Chapter 7

The next morning, I drive to school thinking about last night. What is happening to me? Over the last three days, I can't stop thinking about what has been going on in my life. The killings and the whole wolf thing. Who would've thought that shapeshifters actually existed? I thought that only happened in movies and novels.
To think that I would've been able to shift into a wolf seemed kind of impossible a few days ago, but after last night I think anything's possible.
It's hard to believe that Mr. Daniels was one of the victims that's been murdered.
Why was he murdered?
Mr. Daniels was nothing but kind and generous, and he was respected by many students and teachers here. So, what could he have done to get himself killed?
A thought comes to me, what if this was the same person who murdered Anna? It wouldn't make sense because she died over a year ago, and that was a one-time murder, but what if this murderer has been doing it ever since Anna's death.
What's the significance?
As I arrive at school at 8:45, I reach my locker and grab my Biology book. I turn to look up and down the corridor to see the oblivious faces of the students arriving. I can't help but think to myself that they have no idea what's going on around them, but surely by now they must know about Mr. Daniels.
When the bell chimes for 9:00, I head towards my Biology class, and sit in the empty front desk. I place my book, pencil case and notepad on the desk and wait for class to start.
Sam's probably outside playing football right now. She's always been the athletic one out of the two of us. She's the tall, skinny, long legs and the muscular one, where I'm the one that's short with big boobs, but Sam's the one that attracts all the boys in the school. Not me.
I look at the clock and see that it's past nine.
Teachers aren't usually late to lectures so it's kind of unusual for it to happen to Mr Thompson, because he's never late.
At exactly 9:15 the door to the classroom opens and in walks Mr. Thompson with another student.
Holy...
He has a chiselled shaped face with hooded grey warm eyes. Lips full and firm with spotless porcelain skin.
Golden wispy, untamed thick hair, his body tall and lean. He's wearing a denim jacket on top of a white t-shirt.
Skinny jeans and light brown work boots.
“Good morning class, I apologise for being late. I'd like to introduce everyone to our new classmate. This is Max Fields, and he'll be joining our class so please make him feel welcome.”
I hear people talking under their breaths while Mr. Thompson speaks quietly to Max. I can hear the girls fangirling behind me and I can just imagine that every guy in this classroom thinking they've got competition.
“Now, if you don't mind I'm going to sit you next to Alice here because I feel that she'll get you right on track with the work. From now on, you two will be partners from this year on, and it's up to you Max to catch up with the work. I think Alice will be a great partner for you.”
I smile shyly as Max sits next to me. I can't think of anything to say to him, so I just smile instead.
“I'm Max by the way.” Max smiles with the most perfect smile.
I smile back. “Yeah, I gathered that.”
“I'm sorry that I was put next to you. I don't want to cramp your style or anything.”
He's hot and he's got a sense of humour!
“It's fine honestly. I work better on my own but I'm not against helping people to catch up.”
“I promise not to piss you off too much then.” He smirks at me. “But seriously, please tell me if I do because I sort of don't have any friends.”
“I'm quite a patient person so I can take anything.” I clear my throat and take out a pen. I realize Max doesn't have anything in front of him, so I take out a pen and a few pieces of paper for him.
“Cheers.” He takes the pen out of my hand and writes the date on top of the paper.
“So, what brings you to Small Town?”
He doesn't answer me straight away, he finishes writing, puts the pen down and looks at me.
“My mother and I moved here from the States. My mother's job transferred her here and here we are.”
“What's your mother's job if you don't mind me asking?”
Call me curious but what's the harm in getting to know the guy.
“She's a nurse.” He looks back down at the paper and clears his throat.
“No way! My mother's a nurse too!”
He looks from the paper and smiles. “That's pretty cool.”
Just as Max finishes speaking, Mr. Thompson claps his hands to the classroom.
“Right, today I thought we could do something a little different. Now because we have Max here who has just started, I don't think it's fair on him to come to school today to jump right into today's subject, so I'd like everyone to read section A to C and write notes about variations of genetics so that you're all prepared for next week's quiz.”
Mr. Thompson walks up to our desk and looks at the two of us individually, “Now, Alice, I know you've already done notes on genetics and so on, so if you can print out your notes and give them to Max here at some point today, then he'll be sorted for next week.”
He looks at Max. “Other than that I hope you have a good day. Alice here can take you around the campus to see where everything is, and if I remember correctly, you have the gym and basketball at the end of the day. Alice can take you to where that is if it's alright with her, okay?” He claps his hands again, walks back to his desk and starts typing on his computer.
“He can talk, can he?” Max chuckles. “Yeah, he's a great teacher.”
“You like him?” Max raises an eyebrow and I burst out laughing.
I grimace. “Oh god, not like that! It's more of the way that he teaches that makes him such a likeable person. He shows so much passion in his job and you can clearly see that he loves teaching, and to me, that's the way people should be.” I look away from Mr. Thompson to Max and see that he's smiling at me.
“What?” I slowly wipe my nose and fidget with my hair. “Do you think it will be okay if I joined you for lunch?” “Huh? Oh yeah, sure. My friend would love to meet you.” Sam is going to love him!
“Thanks, I really appreciate it.”
Max and I spoke for the whole two hours. He told me about his life in the States and his mum. His mother and father divorced when he was a baby, and I learnt that he's an only child and he used to live in a house right next to the sea. Talking to Max about his upbringing sounds exactly like my upbringing; I'm an only child and I've never known my father.
As the bell goes to signal the end of the lesson, I pack my things and walk out of the classroom with Max. I see Sam sitting on the floor with her headphones on, and when she sees me with Max she stands up with her eyes wide.
“Well hello there, I'm Sam, Alice's best friend.” She licks her lips and not so subtly checks him out.
