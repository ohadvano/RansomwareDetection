The bosdrake, sensing no killing intent from the human, felt comfortable enough to ask, “What do you need my queex for?”
Kiran regarded her with a baffled stare. “I told, I need it for a spell?”
“You’re a wizard?” said the bosdrake.
“Uh…yes…yes I am…” The conversation felt too alien for the young boy. “Excuse me…miss bosdrake—”
“My name is Gatril,” said the reptile.
“Oh, okay,” said Kiran. Wow, am I really talking with a dragon? “Why are you asking about my profession all of a sudden…Gatril?”
The bosdrake suddenly sat on her bottom, partially opened her legs and gave Kiran a peak at her vagina. Gatril yawned and said, “I’m curious as to why you wanted to hunt me down, human. And you would do good to remember I spared your life out of courtesy, so it’s in your best interest to answer my questions.”
Kiran sighed. “Okay…fine…” His best chance of getting out of this alive was to just play along. But he was proud of himself. He was handling the situation better than he thought, for he had not soiled his pants yet. “The Witching Tournament is held three years in different countries. I’m trying to qualify for this year’s tournament, but I need special animal parts to perform my spells.”
“And that’s why you were going to capture me and rape me?” said Gatril.
“What? No!” Kiran waved his hands dismissively. “I wasn’t gonna rape you! That’s terrible! I’m still a virgin!”
“Then how did you plan on getting my queex?” said Gatril. “In order to get my queex you would’ve had to stimulate me so I can orgasm.”
Kiran nervously rubbed his hands together. “Well,” he looked at a stone on the ground, “I was planning to use my fingers.”
Gatril’s eyes lit up. “Really?” She noticed the key words in his statements, and painted a picture of the young man. “Do you live with your parents, boy? What’s your name?”
“My name is Kiran,” he said. “My father works at a carpeting company. My mother’s a farmer.”
Gatril sat forward, regarding Kiran with intense inhuman eyes that arouse more of his unease. “You sound like a well-off boy, Kiran?”
“Kinda,” he said. “How would you know about human jobs?”
Gatril chuckled. “Do you think you’re the first human I’ve met. For as long as I can remember humans have been coming in contact with beasts. Most hunt us down for our power. Only a very rare few treat us with compassion.”
Kiran hung his head, his eyes losing the willingness to look at Gatril. “I’m sorry,” he said. “This was my first-time hunting anything—anyone. I didn’t know what to do.”
Gatril slowly rose and approached Kiran. He didn’t run, not that he could out-speed her anyway. But he didn’t seem startled. Gatril looked him up and down quizzically. He seems firmly built, she thought. Well, he is a farm boy.
“So are you going to kill me now?” Kiran said.
Gatril shook her head. “No.” She ran her fingers across his cheek, feeling the warmth of his flesh. “I’ve decided I’m going to have some fun with you.”
Kiran arched his spine upon feeling a tingling sensation. “What kind of fun are you talking about?”
Gatril, wearing a fleshy smile, said, “I knew a human once. A man. He was, interesting. I want to see if you can take his place. Meet me here tomorrow at the same time. I’ll help you with your spells.”
“R-Really?” said Kiran, unable to hide his excitement. “I mean…you’re not afraid I’ll just runaway and never comeback?”
“Oh, you’ll return,” said Gatril. “A responsible sorcerer wouldn’t let an opportunity like this pass, would he?”
“No, I wouldn’t!” Kiran’s smile was big and toothy. “Oh wow! Thank you!”
“Stop kissing my ass and go home and get ready,” said Gatril, “we have a long day ahead of us tomorrow.”
Kiran hurriedly took up the parts of his cannon and clutched them under his arms. He gave Gatril one last glance before he hurried to the edge of the jungle.
As promised, Kiran returned the next day. The jungle itself was fifty acres, surrounded by the town on both sides with only a river at the north and south that connected it to distant jungles and forests within the country of Tatanui.
Kiran’s method of transport was a quacycle, a four-wheeled vehicle with a large seat and trolley at the back as the main centerpiece, held within a metal. It also had a large steam engine beneath it, with exhaust pipes jutting out the back.
It was sixty years ago since the world was plunged into the industrial revolution, and small engines like these were becoming widely marketed. Kiran just got his for his sixteenth birthday from his parents, albeit he had to put up some of the money from the odd jobs he was doing through the town; paperboy, yard sweeper, fruit picker and stable boy.
But it was having to put himself through such tasks that gave Kiran joy in his quacycle, and he scribbled his name all over the vehicle and decorated it with red paint and small banners of symbols of the arcane
Kiran stopped a few yards inside the jungle and switched a knob near the steering wheel, turning off the engine. He tied it to a tree with a lock and key and took his knapsack out of the cart. He had hastily repaired his cannon yesterday, only needing to weld the barrel back to the body. Now his focus was on accomplishing his first spell with Gatril’s help.
With giddiness Kiran jogged through the trees with his staff in hand and cannon and knapsack slung across his back. In the distance he spotted a small herd of deer grazing, when they suddenly popped their heads up and looked at him.
Expecting them to run away from the potential predator, one of the deer’s head snapped to the side, an arrow stuck in its eye.
