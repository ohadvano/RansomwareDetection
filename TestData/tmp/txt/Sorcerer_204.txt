Water fell in huge droplets with the force of stones. They splattered upon the popobawa, continuously pushing her down and hitting against her wings—just as Kiran had planned earlier.
The popobawa swore and snarled. “Blast! You damn boy!”
Kiran clutched the staff and wailed upon her repeatedly. “Let go of me!” he said.
When the smoke cleared, Gatril saw the two in the air struggling. “Shit…” She tried to come up with a plan and turned to Aparna for assistance. 
However, the young woman seemed to have been a step ahead of her.
Resting her shooting arm on her other for support, Aparna used the last light of the vanquishing flames to aid her sight as she aimed at the popobawa. Once she had him in her sights, she smiled. “One point for me,” she said
Aparna fired. 
The muzzle flashed. 
The bullet found its mark, and the popobawa screamed, releasing Kiran. They both plummeted, and the women below screamed in despair.
But Kiran wouldn’t have it. His death wouldn’t be here. 
The young sorcerer reached out and grabbed the popobawa by the arm and pulled her close. Channeling the last of his spirit energy into his staff, Kiran used the force-counter spell to propel them across the sky. The blast was enough to change their trajectory and decrease their momentum. 
They hit the ground from seven meters up, and Kiran’s vision suddenly went dark.

Kiran woke the next morning to find himself the dimly lit confines of Gatril’s nest. His eyes were instantly met with Aparna sitting next to him, and Gatril along with an olive-skinned woman, her hands bound behind her and a vexed pout on her face.
“Hey…” Kiran said to everyone, his voice feeble. He tried sitting up but electric pain sat him back down. “Ouch…”
“Don’t move around too much,” said Aparna, gently pushing him back down. “You broke a few ribs and your right arm.”
Kiran responded to the news with distress. He looked at his arm and saw it in a sling, and the bandages on his shoulders and leg. “Aww man.” Kiran groaned. Then he suddenly remembered and his eyes came alight. “Wait a minute, where’s the popobawa?”
“Right here,” said Gatril, gently shoving the strange woman. “We threatened to cut off her clit if she didn’t hand over his queex, so she shapeshifted into this woman.”
Kiran stared at the woman once more, concern replaced with intrigue. She had a slim build and perky breasts, and her crotch was covered in thick pubic hair. “Oh, alright.”
“Bastards,” said the popobawa, its voice high pitched to match its female form. “Just hurry already so I can leave.”
“You’re not in the position to be making demands,” said Gatril. “You’re gonna satisfy my friend to the fullest.”
“Are you sure about that, Gatril?” said Aparna. “Kiran can barely move yet alone thrust his hips.”
“Oh, that’s simple,” said Gatril as she stood and removed her bra and loincloth. “I’ll just get the queex from her for him. You can stimulate Kiran while he watches.”
Kiran shot Aparna a startled glance. It seemed outrageous to think this newcomer would be willing to join their special recreational activity. Aparna met Kiran with a contemplative, almost cynical stare, making him retract his neck in embarrassment.
Kiran turned to Gatril and said, “I think Aparna would be more willing to get the queex from her while you do me.”
“That’s fine,” said Aparna. 
“I-It is?” stammered Kiran.
Aparna stood and took off her clothes. “I’ve always wanted to try a Tatanuese man.”
Aparna’s pubic hair was shaved in a “V” pattern. The fresh smell of bitterweed and sweat wafted off into Kiran’s nose, arousing his sense like an intoxicating drug. 
Aparna gently laid next to Kiran and pulled down his underwear, stroking his swelling penis. She kissed him, and brought her chest up to his face where he could see her dark nipples ready and waiting. As Kiran nibbled and sucked on them, his flaccid phallus had swollen into a sturdy pole.
Gatril got a bowl and got behind the popobawa, sitting her down in her lap and spreading open her legs. Kiran multitasked amongst milking Aparna’s nipple, fingering the inside of her warm damp crotch and watching as Gatril placed the jar between the popobawa’s legs, kissing her cheek and neck.
The popobawa felt Gatril’s clawed fingers slide inside her and winced. “Aah! S-Slow down!”
“Quiet,” said Gatril, and locked her lips with hers, swiveling her tongue in her mouth. The bosdrake tweaked the popobawa’s nipple and vigorously fingered her. The popobawa moaned against her will, unwittingly riding the hand inside her with the contractions.
Aparna applied another wet kiss on Kiran’s lips before she knelt over him and slowly crawled back. Her dark, mysterious eyes glinted like black pearls, locking Kiran in an entrancement. She took his penis and nibbled on it. Kiran bit his lips and twisted his nose. Aparna licked his shaft from the base to the tip. Then she engulfed it.
Kiran had thought the inside of a woman’s vagina was spectacular, but Aparna was proving him silly for ever having considered such a thing.
