PURE WATER





This chapter wil cover three major aspects of water: What is pure soft water? How much

water should one drink? How do you use water external y (hydrotherapy) to heal the

body?



WHAT IS PURE SOFT WATER?

With the exception of pure air, there is no other element of nature that is as

important in sustaining life as pure soft water. The chemical composition of pure soft water

is represented by the chemical formula H20, which means that it is composed of two parts

hydrogen and one part oxygen. Both are odorless, colorless, tasteless and transparent.

Where can one find pure soft water today in our chemicalized society? Municipal

water supplies have been found to contain over 700 different chemicals, yet federal laws

require testing for only 16 of these. Recent research now indicates that chlorine, which is

used by municipal water supplies to kil bacteria, is much more dangerous to human

health than was original y assumed. It has been shown to be a significant contributing

factor in certain types of cancer and heart disease.

In 1987, a major study by the National Cancer Institute concluded that the risk of

developing bladder cancer rose with increased intake of beverages made with chlorinated

surface water - which is what comes out of the tap in about half the households in the U.

S. (1) Bladder cancer primarily affects the elderly and is the fifth most common cause of

cancer in the U. S. The incidence of bladder cancer increased by more than 50% since

1950.. True, properly chlorinated water kil s most germs and viruses, but it also kil s many

cel s in our bodies. If you drink chlorinated water it is best to let the water sit a few

minutes after getting it from the faucet, as chlorine evaporates from the water once it is

exposed to the air.

DONÂ¨T DRINK WATER CONTAINING FLUORIDE, CHEMICALS, METALS

AND PESTICIDES

Fluoride is derived from fluorine, a deadly chemical to humans, and, while not dangerous

in smal amounts, as it accumulates in the human body, it can eventual y cause cancer

and/or other il nesses which can be fatal. Toothpaste is the second largest source of

fluorine, next to water which is number one. Fluorides attack almost everything. Their

chemical action is such that al containers must be lined with rubber or plastic, for they eat

through al metal material. What must it do to the tissues of the body?

"In recent years, public health professionals have become

increasingly concerned over the presence of toxic chemicals in our

drinking water, particularly heavy metals, chemicals, and pesticides.

These substances are extremely difficult to remove once they get into

the water supply.â€(2) Eight out of ten Americans live near a toxic waste

dump or source, according to the Council of Economic Priorities. These toxic sites can

and do contaminate ground water.(3) One pol utant, TCE (commonly used for degreasing

metals) has been appearing in the most unexpected places. Half the water supply of

Silicon Val ey, California is contaminated by it. This has stopped people from using

drinking fountains in Amana, Iowa, and New Brighton, Minnesota. In Green Bay,

Wisconsin, residents have requested emergency wel s. The Environmental Protection

Agency (EPA) reported that TCE has turned up in significant amounts in one out of ten

major ground water systems.

Forty-two mil ion people - one out of every five Americans served by public water

systems - consume dangerous amounts of lead in their household drinking water. (3)

Can a person tel good water from bad water by tasting it? Many chemicals and toxic

substances are odorless and tasteless. There is no way you could taste them. Your water

could be loaded with toxic levels of lead and you would never know it. You can't taste

lead. You can't see lead. Also, it is best not to drink water from plastic bottles as the

chemical in the plastic leaches into the water. This is why much of the distil ed water you

buy in the store in plastic bottles tastes bad.

A warning about tap water - Most people think their city is responsible for giving

them safe tap water. This is not so. A federal court has decreed that a city cannot be held

responsible for the purity and quality of its drinking water. . At least 4,200 cases of bladder

cancer and 6,500 cases of rectal cancer in the United States each year may be a direct

result of drinking chlorinated water. Robert Morris, at the Medical Col ege of Wisconsin,

reached this conclusion after evaluating 10 separate studies on the connection between

cancer and chlorinated water consumption, (American Journal of Public Health, July,

1992). We obviously need to look to another source for our drinking water, since only half

of one percent of our household water is used for drinking and cooking. What about

bottled water? A New York survey found traces of carbon tetrachloride, and other solvents

in 48 of 93 bottled waters sampled in 1987. Bottled water is less regulated than tap water.

So where do we get pure soft water?

DISTILLED WATER IS PURE SOFT WATER

Distil ed water is water which has been heated and turned into vapor, so that

virtual y al its impurities are left behind, since they are incapable of

turning into a vapor. Then the water vapors are cooled down leaving

you distil ed water. Distil ed water has no taste, color, odor, bacteria,

heavy metals, acids, inorganic minerals, toxic chemicals, poisons,

etc. Rain water is also distil ed water, but it becomes pol uted as it

fal s through the sky; so distil ed water is the purest water available.

A simple experiment to try at home is to boil a pan of tap water. Let it

boil until al the water has turned to vapor. What is left in the bottom

of the pan? White chalky mineral deposits. The harder the water, the more minerals it wil

contain; and the fewer the minerals the softer the water. Distil ed water has no minerals,

so it is the softest water possible. The only other kind of filter unit which is good as a

distil er and provides pure soft water and is more economical to operate then a distil er is a

Reverse Osmosis filter unit.



INORGANIC MINERALS, ARE HARMFUL TO THE HUMAN BODY

Regular water consists of inorganic minerals which cannot be assimilated by the

body. The only minerals the body can utilize are organic minerals. Al the inorganic

minerals must be eliminated or they wil in time cause health problems. There is a big

difference between powdered iron filings (inorganic iron) and the iron found in plants

(organic iron). Inorganic minerals are excel ent for the plants which take them and convert

them into organic minerals that our bodies can use. Plants also take the water that is used

to grow our fruits and vegetables and convert it into distil ed water. For example, a fresh

apple consists of 83% distil ed water. When we consume hard water saturated with

calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, silicon, etc., we do not realize that the body is unable

to assimilate these inorganic minerals. These solids or mineral deposits are deposited in

the joints as arthritis, in the intestinal wal s causing constipation, and along the arteries

causing them to harden. The kidneys rol up the mineral deposits into little stones, cal ed

kidney stones until they get too large for the ducts. Calcium deposits in the heart

chambers and valves can become so cemented with mineral deposits that heart surgery

becomes necessary. Calcium deposits in the inner ear cause deafness. Skil ed surgeons

can now remove these deposits and in many cases restore hearing again. Mineral

deposits often coat the crystal ine lens of the eyes with a fine film possibly resulting in

cataracts. (5)



DISTILLED WATER OR REVERSE OSMOSIS WATER HELPS RESTORE

HEALTH

You may have heard that distil ed water leaches good minerals from the body. This

is not so. The only minerals that are leached by distil ed water are the inorganic minerals

that the body cannot use. Distil ed water wil not leach organic minerals that have become

part of the structure of the cel system. Once an organic mineral has become part of the

cel structure, it cannot be leached. As distil ed water enters the body, since it is so pure, it

begins to pick up inorganic mineral deposits that have accumulated in the joints, artery

wal s, or wherever such deposits occur, and begins to carry them out. Gal stones and

kidney stones get smal er and smal er until they pass through the ducts. Little by little

arthritic pains become less as joints become more supple and movable. Arteries gradual y

become more elastic and blood pressure tends to become more normal as the inorganic



22





minerals are removed from the body. I have personal y seen many of my clients, who

switched to distil ed water or reverse osmosis water and modified their diets, total y

recover from many of these health problems.

Note: For those who can afford it, I strongly encourage you to buy a good quality

water distil er or a reverse osmosis filtering system. As for bottled water, I have tested

many types of bottled water and distil ed is purest with Reverse Osmosis running a close

second. The major drawback for both of these is that they come in plastic bottles and the

chemicals in the plastic leach into the water. This is why much of the distil ed water you

buy in the store tastes so bad. Glass jars are best. So, if you can't afford a distil er, take

your empty glass jars to the Reverse Osmosis machines that you now see in front of many

grocery stores and fil them with Reverse Osmosis water.
