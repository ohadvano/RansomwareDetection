GOD PROVIDED EVERYTHING WE NEED FOR HEALTH

God provided us with awesome bodies capable of healing themselves and resisting tremendous strains. He provided all the foods we need to keep our bodies healthy. He even left clue in some of the foods to let us know they were especially good for certain organs and parts of the body. The chart below shows some examples.

A sliced Carrot looks like the human eye. The pupil, iris and radiating lines look just like the human eye - and science now shows carrots greatly enhance blood flow to and function of the eyes.

A Tomato has four chambers and is red. The heart has four chambers and is red. All of the research shows tomatoes are loaded with lycopine and are indeed pure heart and blood food.

Grapes hang in a cluster that has the shape of the heart. Each grape looks like a blood cell and all of the research today shows grapes are also profound heart and blood vitalizing food.

A Walnut looks like a little brain, a left and right hemisphere, upper cerebrums and lower cerebellums. Even the wrinkles or folds on the nut are just like the neo-cortex. We now know walnuts help develop more than three (3) dozen neuron-transmitters for brain function.

47

Kidney Beans actually heal and help maintain kidney function and they look exactly like the human kidneys.

Celery, Bok Choy, Rhubarb and many more look just like bones. These foods specifically target bone strength. Bones are 23% sodium and these foods are 23% sodium. If you don't have enough sodium in your diet, the body pulls it from the bones, thus making them weak. These foods replenish the skeletal needs of the body.

Avocadoes, Eggplant and Pears target the health and function of the womb and cervix of the female - they look just like these organs. Today's research shows that when a woman eats one avocado a week, it balances hormones, sheds unwanted birth weight, and prevents cervical cancers. And how profound is this? It takes exactly nine (9) months to grow an avocado from blossom to ripened fruit. There are over 14,000 photolytic chemical constituents of nutrition in each one of these foods (modern science has only studied and named about 141 of them).

Figs are full of seeds and hang in twos when they grow. Figs increase the mobility of male sperm and increase the numbers of Sperm as well to overcome male sterility.

Sweet Potatoes look like the pancreas and actually balance the glycemic index of diabetics.

Olives assist the health and function of the ovaries.

48

Oranges, Grapefruits, and other Citrus fruits look just like the mammary glands of the female and actually assist the health of the breasts and the movement of lymph in and out of the breasts.

Onions look like the body's cells. Today's research shows onions help clear waste materials from all of the body cells. They even produce tears which wash the epithelial layers of the eyes. A working companion, Garlic, also helps eliminate waste materials and dangerous free radicals from the body

There are many other delicious fruits and vegetables God has provided for us all the things we need for a healthy body. One example is honey, often called the perfect food because of the many healing properties associated with it. Salt water, while we canâ€™t drink it, has many healing properties for our outside bodies; a salt water bath, for instance, is very soothing and healing for sore muscles. Salt water is also a great source for iodine. Everything we need was provided long before we were ever created.

Researchers are just beginning to uncover that all we needed was here all along. Even the formulas for our drugs begin from foods that have healing properties.

RECIPES

There are many recipes for vegetarian and plant-based meals. I have included a couple of web links below. For the first 30 days of my pH cleaning diet I simply adjusted recipes to fit my needs. If you refer back to http://ThingsYouWantToKnow.com/html/how.html I will begin posting recipes. If you would like to share your recipes, simply email me at the site.

http://allrecipes.com/Recipes/Everyday-Cooking/Vegetarian/Main.aspx - This site includes use of oils, eggs, milk, fish, etc. They have a portion function which allows you to enter portions desired, which then adjusts the recipe for you accordingly. They have over 2,000 recipes. I modified ingredients for my meals, especially during the first 30 days.

http://www.vegetariansrecipes.org/ - There is a good selection of recipes at this site.

http://www.vegcooking.com/ - This site is a vegan recipe site which avoids all products that came from an animal. There are some really good recipes here.

CREDITS

Information was gathered from multiple websites, articles, research papers, talking to doctors, the American Diabetes Association and personal experience. The book Reverse

Diabetes Now had a definite influence as regards information and format. Information was verified for accuracy before I began a pH balancing program and again before including in this book. I highly recommend the above book. It contains far more background information with references.

INTRODUCTION

Like many people I thought I could abuse my body by eating what I wanted, when I wanted and as much as I wanted. It is amazing how you can be so busy with life that you let life pass you by. At one point I woke up and realized I weighed in at 335 pounds, so I dieted and exercised my way to 225 pounds. A few years later I found myself back up to 365 pounds. I again started exercising semi-regularly, cut out sodas and started eating healthier, but not healthy. I dropped 80 pounds over the course of around a year. Then I had a stroke.

Talk about a life-changing wake-up call. The stroke affected my right side â€“ speech, chewing, bowels, loss of right arm and leg function, and many inner body functions. I felt like my life was nothing more than surviving day to day, sleeping and eating. Using the restroom, if I could make it in time, was like potty training all over again. I could only sit for a short time before needing to lie down and could not fix my own meals or even get a glass of water. Sleeping more than an hour at a time was a great blessing. As stubborn as I am, I tried to push myself. Some things leave you helpless. No matter how much you try it is out of your control. The simple fact is I had lost my strength, much of my movement and essentially my freedom and independence.

Two years have gone by since the stroke occurred. I thank God for what I can do. Iâ€™ve come a long way, but have further to go to make a full recovery.

When I was in the hospital I was informed that I was diabetic, had high cholesterol and high blood pressure (208/120). They immediately put me on medication and quickly told me what I should and shouldnâ€™t eat. Interestingly, the meals they fed me didnâ€™t match their advice. After 5 days at the hospital, losing more abilities than when I arrived, they finally released me over threats I would simply check myself out. My first visit with a doctor outside the hospital, while writing slip after slip of prescription drugs, the doctor asked how I felt having to take medications the rest of my life.

Shocked, I asked what he meant. He basically replied that it was unlikely I would ever totally control my high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and that diabetes would be with me for the rest of my life. I told him that he better get ready to start reducing my prescription medications, because I wouldnâ€™t be on them forever. I knew it was possible to overcome any adversity. Eating properly and exercising to the best of my limited ability, I began to show him that I was serious. I admit it was very slow going.

Ten months later I had the opportunity to participate in a stroke study at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with the Physical Therapy masters students. With their help, I was eating well and walking 40 minutes twice a day. My bad cholesterol became a thing of the past, but the high blood pressure and diabetes still plagued me and my good cholesterol was too low.

3

Nobody I knew in medicine had an answer. My college degree is in Sports Medicine. I was pre-med at one time and studied molecular biology, physiology and other medical courses. I aced through the classes. But I didnâ€™t know the answer and none of my professors or doctors had an answer. I spent a good nine months spending much of my time looking at studies, research, medical information and my blood test results. I hadnâ€™t lost an ounce in over a year, even with exercise and a reduced calorie diet. That should have done it. I was just tired of the answer that the stroke had affected minor systems in my body that were preventing me from full recovery and weight loss.

I came across a book that said I could cure my diabetes. I saved up, bought it, reviewed it, researched every study mentioned, studied more and then finally tried a version of it that I could live with. Within 1Â½ months of trying my cure for diabetes program my good cholesterol had risen, my blood pressure was normal at 120/70 (thatâ€™s less than my best physical peak when I was young) and I did not need any medicine for diabetes. I gained about 15 pounds when I first started the diet, and then dropped weight for a net loss of 10 pounds â€“ I gained muscle and bone density and flushed away fat. The doctor couldnâ€™t believe it.

I recommend following this program for 90 days and then making a lifetime commitment to eating healthy. I actually stopped after I didnâ€™t need any more medication. I havenâ€™t gained any weight, but I havenâ€™t lost any either, and my blood work continues to show I am healthy. Since starting to write this book to share with all the people asking me what I did, I have started strictly following my own advice again and dropped 5 pounds the first week. Maybe this is the true weight loss answer weâ€™ve all been looking forward to finding.

This book has been written for all those people who have been asking me for information on how I accomplished curing my diseases so quickly. That statement kind of bothers me. I did not heal myself. God gave me a body that was wondrously and fearfully made that was able to heal because I followed the rules He originally set forth for healthy bodies. You can follow some simple steps I have tried to set out here so that your body can heal according to the marvelous work God performed in making you.

I have written background information on pH balances, nutrition, oxygen, water, etc to give you the reasons for what I did and why you should do something similar. I have included charts and tables in the back to help also. I hope the information is written so it is easily understood and helps you. I have experienced the affects firsthand and know it works.

HEALTH CARE EPIDEMIC

As of April 2, 2009, the leading causes of death annually in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control are as follows;

Heart disease: 652,091

Cancer: 559,312

Stroke: 143,579

Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 130,933

Accidents (unintentional injuries): 117,809

Diabetes: 75,119

That is 1,561,034 people last year who died from mostly preventable diseases. That is over 13 times the number of people who die in accidents. It doesnâ€™t include the number of us who have suffered a heart attack or stroke and lived, or who are fighting cancer, respiratory diseases or diabetes.

Below is the number of estimated new cases of these diseases in 2008 in the U.S. alone:

Heart disease: 650,000 new occurrences + 450,000 reoccurrences of heart attacks

Cancer: 1,437,000 newly diagnosed patients

It is estimated there are over 11 million people currently fighting cancer

Stroke: 700,000 new occurrences + 100,000 reoccurrences

It is estimated over 4.6 million people have had a stroke â€“ 30% left with disabilities

Chronic lower respiratory diseases: no information for newly diagnosed cases It is estimated over 16 million people have chronic lower respiratory diseases

Diabetes: 798,000 newly diagnosed patients

It is estimated there are over 16 million people have diabetes

The American Medical Association relies on pharmaceutical medicine to treat the symptoms of these diseases despite the fact that these diseases can be eliminated by proper changes in diet and lifestyle. Even the New England Journal of Medicine, a very prestigious medical publication, acknowledges that diet and exercise can completely eliminate many diseases. Yet doctors are still taught to treat symptoms with drugs rather than trying to cure the disease.

6

When I went to my doctor to find out what I could do to reverse my diabetes I was told that it was a lifetime condition and could not be reversed. Even the American Diabetes Association admits diabetes can be reversed. I think doctors are good overall and care about their patients. They are simply misinformed on many diseases. Doctors have good intentions, but the pharmaceutical industry will lose money if people are actually healed. Diabetes is big business that generates multi-billions of dollars in the US alone. Not to mention the monies brought in annually for heart disease, cancer and other preventable, treatable diseases. It is in the best interests of the drug companies keeping people as lifetime customers.

The drugs and insulin prescribed by your medical practitioners do nothing to promote healing. They simply treat symptoms. If anything they screw up the balance of our bodies and strain an already strained system. My high blood pressure was lowered to normal readings, my cholesterol to healthy levels and my diabetes was reversed. I donâ€™t take any drugs for these or any other condition.

This book is written to share what I have learned after much research, reading and asking questions of others who have reversed their diseases. I know of individuals who were cured of their cancer by making basic changes that anyone can do. Many are the same things presented here that I used. It takes a little effort, mostly to change a few bad habits and add new ones. It can be accomplished by anyone.

pH

pH (potential of Hydrogen) is the measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution â€“ for purposes of this discussion I refer to the pH levels of our blood and cellular fluids. pH is measured on a scale of 0 to 14. The lower the number the more acidic our body fluids and the higher the number the more alkaline we are. A pH of 7.0 is neutral â€“ neither acid or alkaline

As an example, letâ€™s look at a cola. It has a pH of about 2.0 â€“ that is very acidic. Many school students have probably performed the test in class where they dropped a nail in a can of Coke. The nail is usually totally dissolved within 3 days. Cola is also useful in cleaning stubborn stains & grease on clothes and in removing hard to clean toilet and sink stains. If the acid in soda eats through a metal nail, imagine what it does to your body!

Our bodies are naturally slightly alkaline, with 7.3 to 7.5 being the optimum alkalinity for healthy body functions. The pancreas regulates the pH balance in our bodies. This is the same organ which regulates insulin production. The pancreas pulls potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium from our blood stream to balance pH when foods are digested. It requires almost 750,000 times the effort to convert soda at an acid pH of 2.0 to an alkaline pH of 7.5 than it does to convert a fruit or vegetable when digested from a pH of 7.0 to an alkaline pH of 7.5. [Converting pH is exponential: to convert pH 2.0 to pH 3.0 takes a measure of 10. To convert it to the next level of pH 4.0 it takes a measure of 100 (10 x 10). To the next pH of 5.0 it takes a measure of 1,000 (10 x 10 x 10).]

If we do not have enough of the essential minerals - potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium â€“ in our bloodstream from the foods and supplements we eat, the pancreas will begin pulling these minerals from our vital organs, tissues and bones to neutralize the acid and safely process it from through body. This can lead to severe and prolonged damage to the pancreas, bones and muscle if we consume mainly acidic foods. In the back of the book is a chart of alkalizing and acidifying foods. Take a look at how many acidic foods you regularly consume. Can you see how by eating sugars, refined foods, excessive amounts of meat, chips, drinking coffee and soda, etc. we have been taxing our pancreas to try to keep an alkaline balance? Eventually the pancreas canâ€™t keep up and we have an acidic build-up of fluid in our bodies. This leads to all kinds of medical conditions as the acid eats at our organs and tissues.

Mild acidosis can cause such problems as:

â€¢ Cardiovascular damage and hypertension

â€¢ Weight gain and obesity â€“ acid blood causes the body to store the acid in fat. The body actually creates fat to store the acid to protect itself.

8

â€¢ Diabetes and difficulty metabolizing sugar

â€¢ Bladder infections, kidney stones and other kidney conditions

â€¢ Immune deficiency disorders, susceptibility to disease, poor wound healing

â€¢ Cancerous cell mutations

â€¢ Calcium leaching from bones leading to osteoporosis and broken bones

â€¢ Muscle pain, muscle atrophy, poor response, lack of strength

â€¢ Fatigue, low energy, lack of drive

â€¢ Poor digestion, constipation and other bowel problems

Diseases are just warning signs that something is out of order.Something is out of balance in your body. Probably the pH balance.

â€œThe countless names of illnesses do not really matter. What does matter is that they all come from the same root cause... too much tissue acid waste in the body!â€ Theodore A. Baroody, N.D., D.C., Ph.D.

Did you know that a virus or disease cannot thrive in living tissue? It is fact. Yet, we have been taught for decades that germs and virus are responsible for all of our diseases. These microbes exist in our bodies all the time and serve to remove cell waste from our systems, as they thrive on decayed cellular matter. Sure, environmental issues can contribute to some ailments, but most are treatable and curable by our life choices.

Louis Pasteur postured the theory years ago that each disease was caused by specific germs or virus that entered our bodies. Since then, the medical establishment has accepted this theory and tried to develop drugs to treat disease according to different infections. With this theory, everyone would constantly be sick because of all the germs and bacteria in our systems at any time. Drugs actually mask symptoms and are big dollars.

At about the same time Claude Bernard theorized that disease was caused by internal decay which created favorable conditions for micro-organisms (germs), already in our bodies, to thrive. The ideal environment would be one on an acidic scale. The germs are there all the time, but do not affect many people because their internal body environment does not support them.

Our bodies replace old cells as they deteriorate with new cells. In 7 years our bodies will completely remake themselves. That is a lot of decayed material that our bodies must eliminate. Germs normally eat this decayed material and it is flushed from our systems. An acidic environment amplifies the problem, giving micro-organisms an environment to thrive

9

where decayed material is amplified. It isnâ€™t the germ that causes the disease, but the environment of the body. Acidosis in our bodies causes more cellular degeneration and therefore more food for germs and bacteria.

If we continue to overeat, to eat acidic foods and to eat processed foods and snacks, toxins begin to accumulate in our bodies. The acidic environment we create contributes to this toxic accumulation as our pancreas strains to keep up. When your body becomes oversaturated with toxins, a safety valve opens to release toxins, which may come out of any of the four elimination channels of the body; 1) the skin; 2) the lungs and respiratory tract; 3) the bowels

& colon; and 4) the urinary tract. We call these attempts by the body to throw off toxic build-up disease.

Disease is the outward sign of the body trying to heal itself. The body is tryingto eliminate toxic build-up of poisons by any means possible. It must protectvital organs. Obesity is just another way the body protects itself from toxins.

When poisongets into your bloodstream, your body responds by doing whatever it can to get it out of the body in the fastest way possible through any elimination channel available to preserve the functioning of your system. Your body will use up every ounce of energy in its effort to get this poison out. You might experience coughing, throwing up, fever, acne, sweat, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, low energy, joint pains, inability to sleep, fatigue, kidney problems, convulsions, burping, irritations, and many more symptoms.

Acidic pH allows germs to proliferate and the result is treated by the body as a poison. The body is trying to heal itself, but we respond by taking highly acidic drugs intended to treat the problem. We actually amplify the problem, rather than working with the body to help it heal. Drugs donâ€™t cure disease, they mask symptoms. When you understand the pH balance of the body, you begin to understand what is happening in your body.

On his deathbed Pasteur said: â€œBernard was right. The microbe is nothing. The terrain iseverything.â€ (Hume, Ed. Pasteur exposed: the false foundations of modern medicine. Australia: Bookreal, 1989)

Why hasnâ€™t medicine conformed to this information? Money! There is more money in keeping you on pharmaceuticals to treat symptoms rather than fixing the root problem.

Watch this humorous video to get an idea of what the pharmaceutical & food processing conglomerates get us to believe so they can keep us thinking we need their harmful drugs and the harmful foods they offer. I wonâ€™t get into conspiracy theories â€“ there are plenty of books

to convince you of that â€“ but think about why there is a simple cure, but no widespread offering or teaching of the cure. They have controlled the medical schools and media for years. Why do the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies make more profit than the rest of the Fortune 500 combined? Why do the pharmaceutical companies only make donations to medical colleges that teach drugs and none to so-called â€˜druglessâ€™ medical schools? Why are pharmaceutical companies so intent against supplement companies and alternative treatments? Why do the countries using the most â€˜medicinesâ€™ have the most unhealthy citizens? http://www.matttraverso.com/video/healt-ebook/fda-cartoon/fda-cartoon.html

Youâ€™ve heard the saying, â€œgarbage in, garbage out.â€™ We put a lot of unhealthy foods into our bodiesâ€™ systems. Marvelously created as they are, they struggle to process the garbage into energy to sustain the body and to then flush the unhealthy by-products out.

Letâ€™s look at a car for example. If you used a poor quality gas to fuel the engine it would start to accumulate deposits. It will run great for a while. The car will use the gas to produce the energy the car needs to turn the pistons to move the car. After a time the poor fuel supplied will accumulate larger deposits, affecting how well the car burns the gas. Spark plugs will have a harder time sparking because of the build-up of gunk. The pistons will struggle to move as freely to move the car. It may take years. After a time you have to perform some major work to keep the car even operating properly. The car has tried to eliminate the by-products of the poor fuel since day one, but canâ€™t discharge all of it through the exhaust system and deposits formed inside the engine. The same is true of your body. If you use poor quality fuel, your body does what it can to convert in into energy. Poor quality fuel leaves too much bad by-product for the body to eliminate.

The body is basically a bio-electrical engine. It has a current charged through the bloodstream. The blood carries the fuel from digestion to the cells where it is broken down into energy so the body can operate. This charge operates at an acid-alkaline balance of 7.36 The pancreas is the organ that regulates the pH balance so that the system operates at optimal performance. Each organ has a part in this operation. The heart pumps the blood throughout the body so that fuel and oxygen are delivered to the cells and waste is taken away to the lungs and the kidneys. The liver converts fuel into useable components. Every organ has a part in this biological machine.

The body works very hard to keep your entire system at an optimal pH balance so that each element can perform at its peak. If you do not consume enough alkaline producing calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium your body pulls the stored supplies from your tissues and bones. Excess acid will be stored in fat to neutralize its damaging effects to the body. Yourbody will actually create fat to store the acid. Osteoporosis is an affect of the body leeching the bone of essential minerals. Excess fat is the bodyâ€™s way of protecting itself from acid brought about by an acidic body fluid balance caused by eating acidic foods and by

overeating. You wondered why you eat so little yet keep gaining weight? Here is your answer.

There are many reasons besides the foods we eat that can adversely affect pH balance. These reasons include negative emotions, thoughts, words and actions. Research shows that these adverse feelings can be a major cause of high blood acidity. God sure had it right when He told us that forgiveness, thoughts and actions and our very words will affect our well-being. Did you know that studies show that those who pray daily, or who read the Bible daily, or those who meditate regularly or even those who attend a church weekly have better blood pH results? Unforgiveness, gossip, negative thoughts, negative feelings towards others, belittling others, harmful words and hurtful actions affect our bodies negatively.

Lack of sleep, stress, not regularly exercising, shallow breathing, chemicals, radiation and pollution are other factors which lead to acid pH levels within us and cause cellular disturbances. Smoking, alcohol, vinegar, animal protein, many cooking oils, refined sugar, processed foods and overly highly refined carbohydrates (flours, crackers, etc.) are other causes of the breakdown at a cellular level that lead to acid pH.

The chart on the next page gives a general idea of which foods are more on the alkaline scale and which are more acidic. Please note that the foods are not listed based on their pH balance before consumption, but according to their effect on the body after eating. For example, citrus fruits are listed as alkaline, as they have an alkalizing affect on the body, even though these fruits are more acidic before they are eaten.

The rule of thumb is: Eat more of what grows on trees and plants and much less of what has to be processed in a manufacturing plant to make it edible. Fresh food is great but loses vitamins on the way from the harvest to your table. Flash frozen contains more of the vitamins of the pre-harvest food as the food is frozen soon after harvest. Even canned fruits and vegetables contain lots of good vitamins, as long as they are packed in water, no added sugar, with little or no sodium.

Nuts, seeds and avocadoes are good for you. Plant-based foods we have always considered bad for you are full of natural omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids which protect the heart and perform many functions in the body. Thatâ€™s why we call them essential fatty acids.

Real foods are not only delicious; they provide all of the nutrients our bodies need to heal and to allow you to live a healthy life to the fullest.
