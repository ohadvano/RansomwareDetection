Gatril knelt over the leopard and inspected it. “I’m fine,” she said. She took out her knife and began cutting open the cat. Kiran saw the scratches on her skin, but little blood. Dragon skin was known for being very resistant after all.
“What are you doing?” Kiran said.
“Can’t let meat go to waste,” she said, ripping out the leopard’s heart and liver. These she ate on the spot, and peeled the leopard’s skin off and carve off huge hunks of meat. She wrapped them in the skin and stood. The process itself took only a few minutes. “Let’s leave before more predators come after us.”
They rode away from the carcass and through the plain once more, their eyes and ears warier of the predators. This allowed Gatril to identify a clan of prowling hyenas and instruct Kiran to ride around them. 
Kiran and Gatril came to another tree where they made their second stop. This one was close to a nearby cluster of trees and bushes and a very small watering hole.
They climbed the tree and surveyed the land once more. Their wait wasn’t long, and Gatril saw it. Saw her first. It came out of the brush, slithering across the ground with a slick and shiny grey body with bands of black. Her face had a blunt nose, and thin lips rimming her wide mouth. Her eyes were bright yellow with long lashes, and around her head was stringy brown hair. She leisurely coiled her body atop a rock, resting her head across her folded arms. 
Gatril tapped Kiran for his attention, and gestured to the lamia. Kiran observed the beast through his binocular and grinned excitedly. “Great! I have her!”
Gatril nudged him. “Keep your voice down”
“Sorry,” Kiran said. “So how do we get it from her? I wanted to subdue her with some glue rounds. But maybe that would get her riled up.”
“I’ll try to give her a talk,” Gatril said.
“Really?” replied Kiran.
“Beasts such as ourselves have respect for each other you know,” said Gatril. “If you were to go, she would most likely eat you on the spot. Just give me a moment.”
Gatril climbed down the tree and approached the massive serpent. Kiran watched in the distance as the lamia raised her head at the bosdrake. He saw their mouths moving, but he couldn’t hear their words. At one point Gatril gestured in his direction and the snake turned its head his way. 
Then Gatril turned to the tree and waved at Kiran.
Kiran took a deep breath and relaxed. He climbed down the tree with his gear towards the two reptilians.
Upon nearing the lamia, Kiran could see more of her in detail, and realized that her huge, muscular body could easily crush him to a pulp.
“Here he is,” said Gatril, playfully pushing Kiran to the front. 
The serpent rose its upper body and unfolded her arms, revealing small breasts with pointed nipples. She hovered over Kiran, her pink tongue flashing from her mouth like lightning. She had a smell similar to wet soil, not unpleasant, but pungent, and it got Kiran wondering how her fluids would taste.
“So,” the serpent said, “this is the lowly human who wishes to get inside my womb?”
Kiran glanced over at Gatril and wondered what the bosdrake could’ve told the lamia. He brought his eyes back to the lamia and said, “My name is Kiran Kehomba. I’m a young sorcerer in training. Great serpent, I wish to receive some of your queex so I can complete a spell. I’m ready to do anything you desire.”
“Is that so?” she said. Half her body slithered off the rock and wound its way around Kiran. His muscles felt almost weak against her muscles, even though she was careful not to touch him. “What makes you think I need anything from a human, other than to put him in my stomach?”
Kiran’s said, “Well…besides eating, what else do you like, great serpent?”
“My name is Scalian,” she said.
“Yes. Right. Scalian.” Kiran looked at Gatril again, who urged him to go on. “Well Scalian, I can give you anything you want besides a human to eat. Like the best sex you ever had, for example?”
Scalian frowned. “…Is that all?”
Kiran fumed. He climbed out of her coils and stood a distance away. “Look here,” he said, “my plan was to attack you while you were sleeping, but I chose not to. I’m trying to be nice. Just stop being mysterious and tell me what you want already?”
But to Kiran’s surprise Scalian laughed, a raspy one. She turned to Gatril and said, “I guess you were right. He isn’t a sexplorer.”
“Wait, you were testing me?” Kiran scratched his head.
Scalian said, “Yes. I hate humans who try to establish their dominance over everyone else. If your friend hadn’t convinced me otherwise, I would’ve already eaten you.”
“Okay…” said Kiran. “Then, will you give me your queex?”
“I will,” said Scalian. “But I won’t have sex with you,” she showed Kiran her long tail. “I use this when I get lonely. I’ll pleasure myself and provide the queex to you.”
“Oh,” said Kiran. “That’s good news.”
“However,” Scalian began, “I will need something to stimulate me. You and your friend will have to mate in front of me to get me properly aroused.”
“Whoa,” said Kiran. “I don’t think I can do it in front of someone else.”
Then Gatril hugged Kiran’s arm and said, “Oh, stop being so shy. I thought you said sorcerers are willing to do anything to get what they want?”
