He stands twice the size he was just now, I'd need to stretch my whole arm upwards to be able to touch his snout. He lowers his head as if he's studying me very carefully, and he probably recognizes my scent from before when I attacked him in Sam's house. I don't move a single muscle in case any kind of movement will aggravate the Alpha standing fearless in front of me.
A few minutes go by with him just staring intensely at me, a part of me is scared of what this beast might do to me, but I know Ryder wouldn't hurt me on purpose. Ryder takes one more look at me, turns around and follows the same footprints as Bane and Kellan.
I let out a breath of relief when Ryder's form disappears but I'm left feeling lost with what to do next.
I was told to keep calm but how can I when my heart is racing?
I hastily take off my white sandals, my white tank top and throw it to the floor followed by my ripped jeans. I look around consciously hoping that nobody can see me but relax when I realize that nobody would be out here, other than the occupants that live here. I undo the straps of my bra followed by my underwear and stand alone in the wolves' yard. I close my eyes to focus on slowing my heart rate and take deep breaths.
I repeat this until my breathing and heartbeat is slow and steady.
I take one last breath and lower my posture to be on my hands and knees when suddenly I feel as if I'm shrinking on the inside. I don't know how I brought this feeling onto myself, but knowing that I'm about to shift into a beautiful wolf excites me. I shake off the feeling of stopping everything and just try to relax when suddenly the feeling of needing to shiver comes unexpectedly, and without realizing what could happen next, the shiver takes over my whole body.
And the shift happens so effortlessly.
I don't feel any different other than having the feeling that I'm in a bubble. She stands to her full height, and after a while of getting used to the new height, I try to get her to move but she seems reluctant.
