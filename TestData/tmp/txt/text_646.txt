Who would do such an animalistic thing?
I must have been thinking really hard because I don't hear the person shouting my name from behind me. I turn around and from afar I see a lone figure standing on crutches. I squint my eyes to see who it is but it's too blurry to make out the person. I look around to see if it was my name that was being called, but realises there's only me outside.
I stand and walk towards the figure.
When I come somewhat closer to the person, I don't expect that person to be Max.
What the hell?
When I stand in front of Max, I'm completely speechless. His whole face was black and blue.
Black eyes circle around his eyes, his right cheek is badly bruised and his lips are twice the size of yesterday with nasty looking cuts on both sides of his lips. Not to mention that he's on crutches with god knows how many bruises underneath his clothes.
“Hey, you.” Max smiles at me.
How can he smile beneath his beaten face? “Max.	what?”
