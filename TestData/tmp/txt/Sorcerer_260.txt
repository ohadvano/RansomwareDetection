“We can camp and rest when night falls,” said Kiran. “I heard reports of a popobawa in a forest near Dehafi Town. That’s three miles from here.”
“Okay, boss man,” said Gatril. 
Their journey took them around a small hillside that overlooked a vast plain and mountains in the distance, where the morning became brighter and warmer. Just beyond the mountains in the east lay the country of Gobanyi, where Kiran knew young magical practitioners like himself were prepare for the Witching Tournament. It got him wondering how well his spells would fare against the techniques of the others.
Of course I’ll do fine, he thought. I’m going through so much trouble to get rare spells after all.
As they descend onto flat grassland, the town of Dehafi rose into view. Its most dominant features were pillars of black smoke spewing from the factories. The distance between the town and the human-bosdrake pair was occupied by scattered trees that loomed over the swaying grass, grass being tended to by grazing gazelles and zebras.
Kiran and Gatril weren’t looking out for anything out of the ordinary, concerned only with reaching the town, yet something amongst the animals managed to snag their attention.
“Whoa, what’s that over there?” said Gatril.
“Huh?” Kiran parked his quacycle along the road. He looked in the direction Gatril gestured to, and spotted someone in a dusty robe kneeling next to one of the zebras. “Who is that?”
“There’s only one way to find out if you really want to know,” said Gatril.
Kiran turned off the engine and he and Gatril got off the vehicle. They made their way through the grass, kicking up bugs with each step. Some of the animals scattered but the one the person was next to didn’t budge an inch. And when they got close enough, they saw what was really happening.
The stranger was a woman. She wore a red tunic and a shiny, green fabric wrapped around her waist and draped over her shoulder. Kiran recognized it as a sari, and coupled with the woman’s brown skin and black, straight her, he deduced her origins as a Gabanyese from the neighboring country.
But it was what she was doing rather than her nationality that captivated Gatril and him.
The zebra’s penis was fully erect, which the woman stroked and sucked on fiercely with slurping sounds and lots of froth.
“Wow, she’s really working it,” said Gatril.
Kiran looked at her indifferently. He was not disgusted in the sense of the word, but he didn’t fancy sexual activity with animals. What differentiated beasts from animals was the fact that they had human intelligence and at least human-like features; breasts and genitals shaped like that of a human female. 
“Excuse me, lady?” Kiran said.
The woman held a finger for their silence, and continued to stimulate the animal until her cheeks abruptly puffed, spilling semen from the corners of her mouth. She made a choking sound as she held a little of the fluid in her throat. She reached for a jar on the ground, pulled the throbbing, dark phallus out of her mouth and spat the semen into a jar. 
As the strange woman got up and wiped her mouth, Kiran noticed a knapsack at her feet and the crude handle of a pistol in her waist. She looked at the pair with black eyes, smirking a little as if please with herself.  “Yes, may I help you two?” she said.
Kiran and Gatril looked at each other, and the bosdrake gesture to the woman urgently. Kiran said, “Excuse me. I didn’t mean to intrude. I was riding by when I saw you here. I guess this is a bad time?”
“No,” she said. “I’m just about finished.” She took up the knapsack and put the jar inside. Shouldering it, she said, “So, why is a human travelling with a bosdrake?”
“I’m his friend with benefits,” said Gatril, slapping Kiran’s bottom.
The woman smiled. “I see. My name is Aparna.”
“My name is Kiran,” the young man said. “And this is Gatril. I’m a sorcerer.”
“I could tell,” said Aparna, gesturing to Kiran’s staff. “I guess you could call me a sorceress then.”
It was as if someone quickly wound up Kiran, straighten his back and widening his eyes. “Really? You practice magic too?”
Aparna nodded. “I was getting this zebra semen for my spell.” Aparna looked Kiran with heightened curiosity. “Wait, would you be entering the Witching Tournament by any chance?”
“Yeah,” said Kiran. “I’m here trying to get some popobawa queex.”
Aparna said, “Really? That sounds a little dangerous though. I know a few people who got attacked by them. They got their blood drank, some even got raped. I heard they used to attack the townsfolk until they got guns and killed them off. Now only one lurks in the forest nearby, but no one dares to venture inside.”
“That’s no problem,” said Gatril. “We fought something much scarier than that just yesterday. Do you happen to live around here?”
“No,” said Aparna. “I’m actually visiting from Gabanyi. I came here for a few ingredients that could only be found on this side of the continent. So far I’ve gotten two of the four. I need the queex of a brustark and the semen of a dandepuffer.”
“Those aren’t easy animals to capture either,” said Gatril. “Especially the brustark.”
“Don’t worry,” said Aparna. She gestured to the zebra behind her, now going about its business grazing. “I can drug them like I did this one.”
“Dandepuffers are close to my village,” said Kiran. “Opposite of where I found you, Gatril.”
Something had been bothering Gatril, and she said, “But Kiran, she just mentioned that the popobawa usually rape people. Are they all males, or do they also have females?”
“They are a bit of both,” said Kiran. “They tend to look like females, but they have a five-inch-long clitoris they use to have intercourse with and release semen. I just need to knock her out and capture her.”
