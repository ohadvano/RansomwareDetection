“You want me to take these out to the dumpster?” I ask as I gather all six bags, three in each hand, and look up at Terry.
“Please, I would really appreciate it.” He grabs his jacket, waves, and leaves.
I stare at the swinging door dumbfounded and shake my head.
With the bags still in my hands, I leave through the back and walk towards the dumpster. I scoff when I see that it's pouring down with rain.
Great. Thanks, Terry. Thanks a bunch.
I push open the top of the dumpster, and grab the first two bags to throw in when from the darkness behind me, I hear the faint unmistakable sound of growling. I freeze, wondering if that was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Terrified, I clutch the bags close and turn around, holding the bags as one would a sword, ready to strike out. I turn, and as I open my eyes, I see the source of the growling, as standing not two meters away is the largest wolf I've ever seen.
I whimper in fright, and slowly start to retreat backwards, dropping my makeshift weapon as I go. I feel my back touch the dumpster, and realize there's nowhere for me to go. Shaking in fear, I close my eyes, praying the wolf doesn't see me as a threat or worse, a meal.
“Please don't hurt me.” I whisper repeatedly to myself. I open my eyes and wish that I hadn't.
Its eyes will haunt me for as long as I live. The eyes were blood-red, filled with pure hatred towards me. A dull shade of gray covers its whole body with big chunks of its fur missing, like it had been ripped off. The wolf looked as though it had scars everywhere on its body. How had it managed to survive this long?
