I nod my head.
Do I mention what happened to Mr. Daniels to her or not?
“Yeah, Mr. Edmund has taken over the class.” I clear my throat. “And school? The same as always, I guess.”
Sally raises her brow. “Meaning?”
“Meaning...” Before I have a chance to answer I get interrupted.
“Meaning it's an absolutely pointless ritual that's full of hormonal teenage boys who drool at even a slight peak of cleavage.”
I'm looking at my best friend with my mouth hanging wide open; stunned into silence. When I think that her mother is going to yell at her daughter for being crude, Sally surprises me when she bursts out laughing. “The words that come out of your mouth, Sam.” She stands from the table and empties the contents into the sink. “You're definitely my daughter.”
Sam scoffs. “And here I thought I was adopted.”
Sam takes an apple from the fruit bowl that sits on the end of the table.
