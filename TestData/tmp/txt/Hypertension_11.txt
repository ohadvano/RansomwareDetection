He walks down the aisle holding the clipboard that holds everyone's name, and tilts his head to the side.
â€œThat is correct, yes.â€ I say with a calm, and collected voice.
â€œAlways raise your hand if you have a question.â€
He does a once over on me, then walks to the front of the class, and points to the board.
â€œI'm your teacher now. Whatever Mr Daniels taught you before, forget about it because he's not coming back.â€
He claps his hands together and looks at me. â€œNow Alice, why don't you start reading for us. Chapter 8, I presume?â€ He sits down in the chair, and motions with his hand for me start reading.
Where are you, Mr. Daniels?
Chapter 3

At six o'clock, I work my way towards the back of the diner to the office, where Robbie sits behind his desk on the phone.
â€œYes, love. Of course, I'll make sure to buy the right one this time, alright love you too. Bye.â€
He looks at me with his toothless grin. â€œAlice, how are you?â€
â€œI'm good, thank you, but I just wanted to ask you if there's an extra uniform here somewhere?â€
â€œWhat happened to the uniform you have?â€
He stands from the old wooden chair, and looks in the cardboard boxes that are placed at the back of the office.
â€œI spilt some coffee on the shirt, and the stain won't come off.â€
I can't lie for shit, but he seems to be buying it.
He sits back down just as he hands me a new uniform, â€œBe careful this time, alright? I mean, I know you like your coffee, but if it happens again, I'm going to have to ask you to pay for it.â€
I take the uniform from him, â€œThank you, Robbie, and this time I promise to be more careful.â€
I walk rapidly towards the bathroom, lock the door and look at myself in the mirror. I had a heart-shaped face with rosy coloured cheekbones. My never-ending white blonde hair is always kept in a braid down my back. Ivory skin with bright pale blue eyes; like the clear sky. My mother tells me that my eyes are like the colour of diamonds, eyes that are so pale they could appear as white. My teeth are perfectly straight and white after years of my mother lecturing me about how to look after them. My nose is a little on the prominent side, but you can blame my father for that. Thankfully, that's the only thing I have of him.
I've never known my father, nor will I ever want to know him.
After a few moments I sigh, close my eyes and rest my hands on either side of the sink.
Just get it over and done with!
I open my eyes and take off my shirt swiftly, and look over my shoulder to look at the bite.
â€œWhat the hell...?â€
I look in the mirror to see nothing but pure smooth skin, â€œWhere is it...?â€
Not a single bite mark was to be seen.
I didn't understand. It happened just hours ago and yet it's gone?
After changing into my uniform, I walk out of the bathroom and place myself behind the counter, but I couldn't concentrate on doing anything. Questions kept interrupting my thoughts, but I couldn't answer either of them. Maybe it healed overnight?
I peel my shirt over my right shoulder and check again. Nothing.
â€œChrist, Alice, you trying to give these people a strip tease or something?â€
I roll my eyes when I hear her voice. I look towards the front of the diner to see Sam walking towards me with her school bag draped over her shoulder. She takes out her laptop and today's homework, and sits directly in front of me on our new red diner stools.
â€œI'll have a strawberry milkshake and a few fries please.â€ She types away on her laptop as I prepare the milkshake.
I walk to the kitchen to see Terry preparing the food for the waiting customers.
â€œAnother order of fries on its own but it's Sam, so take your time, okayâ€' I do a thumbs up but he doesn't see it, or he's probably ignoring it.
As I walk back into the diner, I realize it's not as busy as I thought it would be.
â€œAlice, the milkshake's kinda overflowing.â€ Sam says nonchalantly.
â€œShit!â€
I rush to the milkshake machine, clean up the mess and pass it over the counter.
â€œThank you kindly.â€ Sam takes a sip of the milkshake, sighs in delight and puts away the laptop.
â€œSo, what do you think of our new English teacher? Hot right?â€ She winks at me. â€œI mean, I would.â€
â€œSam! He's like forty years old!â€ I hit her with the dishcloth that I keep on my shoulder.
â€œAge is just a number!â€
All the patrons in the diner stop talking, turn in their chairs and stare at the two of us as we laugh over Sam's infatuation with our new teacher. I apologize immediately to them for our adolescent behaviour.
â€œSam seriously, he's old enough to be your father.â€ I clean the counter to look busy when the diner door opens.
Almost immediately, I notice everything falling silent.
I glance over to see why the place has gone quiet, only to see four tall frames at the diner's entrance.Why were they here? They looked so out of place.
Bane walks with confidence towards the closest patron, leaving the other three standing guard at the door. He leans down to one of the regulars and speaks to him. I didn't know how I could hear him, but I heard every single word.
â€œYou might wanna stop staring at us before I tear you apart piece by piece big man.â€
â€œHey!â€ I rush from behind the counter, stand directly in front of him only to be met with a broad chest.
â€œI don't care who you are, but I won't have you talking to the regulars like that.â€
At this point, Ryder stands by Bane's side, never taking his eyes away from me.
â€œAre you saying we aren't welcome here because we're not regulars?â€ Bane looks at me with pure disgust written on his face.
â€œOf course, you're welcome here, but if you're going to disrespect the regulars then I'm going to have to ask you to leave.â€
I say this with as much confidence as I can muster, but with Ryder standing with his eyes on me the whole time, I'm really quite surprised I haven't shat myself.
â€œWe aren't here to start trouble. We just came to have some food in this highly recommended diner that you have here.â€ Ryder's voice fills the whole diner. While he speaks, I can't help but stand there looking into his bright green eyes.
â€œWell, as long as you don't start trouble, take a seat, and I'll grab you some menus.â€ I say.
Neither of us takes our eyes away from each other, but the connection is broken too quickly when I hear Sam's voice calling me.
â€œAlice! Where the hell are my goddamn fries!?â€
I turn around to see Sam giving me the grumpiest look ever known to mankind.
Without looking at Ryder, I excuse myself and walk behind the counter, my hands shake as I grab four menus and four pairs of cutlery. I glance up again to see Ryder sitting in one of the booths with his friends, but his eyes remain on me.
â€œI'm known for being a patient person, but please give me my fries!â€
â€œI told Terry to take his time, so whenever Terry's ready to make your fries, he'll make them.â€
I walk past the counter, and laugh when I hear Sam confronting Terry in the kitchen.
While that's happening, I stand at the edge of the table and hand Ryder all the menus.
â€œI'll be back in a few minutes to take your order. Kitchen closes at seven thirty.â€ I hurry back to the cashier, when I notice Sam sitting back in her seat, with a few fries on a plate.
â€œThose aren't yours, are they?â€ I point towards the fries on the plate just as I hear Terry yelling from the kitchen.
â€œNope, but they're mine now.â€ She grabs for another fry just as her elbow knocks the milkshake over, and that's when everything happens in slow motion.
Time slows down as I see the milkshake descend to the floor. I feel this uncontrollable urge to catch it before it falls. With the time slowing down, it gives me enough time to catch it, just inches before it spills everywhere. I look at the milkshake resting in my hand and check around me to see if anyone noticed, but I'm only met with four curious sets of eyes.
â€œNice reflexes you got there Alice.â€
Sam doesn't seem as freaked out like I am right now. Instead, she picks up another fry just as I slam down the milkshake on the counter, to which it topples over.
My breath hitches, â€œYou didn't see that?â€
â€œSee what? You rescuing my delicious milkshake that is now spilling everywhere on this counter?â€
â€œSam, honestly, I'm freaking out right now!â€ â€œAre you okay? Want me to call your mum?â€
â€œNo, I just. I need to tell you something about what happened here last night.â€ I whisper to her over the counter in the hope that nobody hears me.
â€œWhat's going on with you today? And why are you whispering? No one's looking at us.â€
â€œThey're watching.â€ I answer.
Sam remains looking at them until she turns around and tells me that they're leaving.
â€œWhat's the problem? What happened last night?â€
I take a steady breath, and replay the events of last night. â€œI was working here last night until closing hour. Terry and I were the only ones left at the diner. He asked me to take the trash out to the dumpster and I heard a growl from behind me. It was so quiet I thought I didn't hear anything, but I turned around and saw the biggest wolf I've ever seen, and I've never seen a wolf that big before in Small Town.â€
Sam rolls her eyes. â€œI mean we see wolves all the time, we live in Small Town for gods sakes! We're gonna see wolves running around and for one being here, it was probably drawn to the smell of rotting food or something.â€
Sam grabs her schoolbag from the floor, and starts packing her things.
â€œSam, I'm telling you, it was huge! It bit me right on the shoulder and ran away!â€
Sam stops packing her thing, and looks at me with pure worry on her face.
â€œIt bit you? Did you tell your mum to look at it?â€
I shake my head knowing she's about to have an outburst. â€œNo.â€
â€œWhy the hell not!? She's a nurse! God knows what that thing carries.â€
â€œThere wasn't any point in telling her because by the time I went to bed the cuts were all sealed closed, and the marks were completely gone when I changed for work.â€
I show her my shoulder to find it still the same. No bite marks.
â€œWhy didn't you say anything in school?â€
â€œI didn't think it really mattered when I woke up this morning and only saw a few cuts there.â€ A pause.
â€œI wish I knew what to tell you or at least give you advice but...â€
Sam remains calm and collected, but I know that on the inside she worries too.
â€œYour milkshake would have been on the floor if I hadn't moved to grab it in time. I'm telling you now, everything in this room moved in slow motion like the time was slowing down for me to catch it before it leaked on the floor. And then hearing Bane whispering to Paul to stop staring or he'd tear him apart. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he's sitting right by the door and I'm all the way back here! Something's wrong with me!â€
I turn around to face the coffee machine and pour myself a large cup of coffee.
Sam speaks to me in a quiet and comforting tone, she probably knows that I'm close to losing my mind.
â€œThis all happened after it bit you?â€
â€œYeah, and it scares me to even think about what could happen to me. What if I actually turn into one?â€ I turn around with my mug of coffee and sit next to her.
Sam scoffs, â€œYou're my best friend, and whatever happens just know that I'll be there for you. Even if you don't want my help, you shouldn't go through this alone. So, if you do turn into a big scary wolf, which is impossible by the way, I promise not to tell anyone. The last thing I want is you chasing me on a full moon.â€
Sam stays with me till the end of the shift but leaves shortly when her mother comes to take her home. Sally offers to take me home, but I politely decline because I've got to lock up the diner.
I take out the trash, brush and mop the floor, then change out of my uniform. I lock up the back and exit through the front.
I double check that the door is locked when I hear rustling coming from behind me. I shrug it off blaming the wind, but when I hear it again I can't help but think it's the wolf from last night. I stay rooted to the ground in absolute fright when I hear laughter coming from behind me.
I turn around a little too quickly, and fall forwards on the floor.
â€œI didn't know for sure, but I had to check to see if I was right and now that I know, I was right about you.â€
I look up into Ryder's cold, distrusting green eyes.
I stand with unsteady legs, and shiver when my back connects with the diner's cold, damp door, â€œWhat are you talking about?â€
Ryder, Bane and Silver create a half circle around me. Ryder was standing in front of me while the other two stands on either side.
Kellan remains a little further behind Ryder, showing no signs of joining this little confrontation.
Silver steps forward, grabs my braid and pulls my head back hard. She leans forward right into my jugular and inhales. â€œShe's new, but she's changing fast. I wouldn't be surprised if she changes tonight if she survives that is.â€
She shoves my head forward and stands back.
It's Bane's turn to step forward. He stands in front of me, shielding Ryder from view. Bane reaches out with his giant-sized hand and wraps his hand around my delicate throat. â€œLet's get one thing clear here. I don't like you nor will I ever like you. I don't trust easily when it comes to people like you. His scent is all over you, and it's taking every ounce of control I have not to kill you.â€
â€œKill me?â€ I stutter.
â€œI promise you, if you get in my way and humiliate me again as you did in there, I'll kill you myself.â€
I reach with both of my hands to stop Bane from strangling me. His figure goes all blurry, when suddenly his hand disappears from my throat. I fall to the ground like a rag doll on all fours, and start gasping for air.
I hear them arguing above me, but I can't make out a single word.
I look up with blurry eyes to see Kellan standing in front of me in a protective stance.
â€œHe was killing her and you weren't gonna do shit about it! She's got nothing to do with the murders here!â€
Ryder's head tilts to the side as he listens to Kellan, â€œYou don't know that. Anyway, leave us. I need to have a little conversation with Alice. Alone.â€
Both Silver and Bane snicker like hyenas as they run into the middle of the road.
â€œKellan, leave. I'm not going to hurt her.â€
Ryder kneels down in front of me and cups my cheek gently.
As Kellan walks away, he turns around and looks at Ryder with warm, sorrowful eyes. â€œShe's no threat to us.â€
â€œGo home, Kellan!â€
By the time I can stand on my own two feet, Kellan's already out of sight.
Chapter 4

The last thing I wanted do right now is to have a conversation with Ryder. I'd rather stick pins in my eyes and cut out my tongue than speak to him. But here we are, in the middle of the night.
â€œLook, I'm really tired and a little pissed off with you and your friends. So just say what you got to say and leave me alone.â€
Hopefully, he'll never have to speak to me again. â€œWhat happened to you last night?â€
I should have moved when I had the chance because right now, my boobs are getting to know his chest really well.
â€œAbsolutely nothing. And anyway, it's not like I owe you an explanation.â€
Ryder cages me in with both of his hands on either side of my head. â€œYou think I didn't see you inside that diner? We all did! So I need to know what happened to you last night.â€
â€œWhy is it so important for you to know?â€ I duck underneath his arm, and start walking.
â€œAlice! You need to listen to me.â€
Before I know it, Ryder grabs my wrist and turns me around to face him. â€œYou may not believe me, but I'm trying to help you.â€ â€œHelp me!?â€
â€œI'm trying to help you understand what you're about to go through.â€
â€œAnd what would that be?â€ I take my hand from his hold, and place my hands on my hips in expectation of his answer.
â€œYou might think I'm joking, but trust me I'm not.â€ Ryder turns his back on me, places his hands in his pockets and sighs in defeat. â€œIn a few days, you'll go through the change.â€
I frown. â€œThe change?â€
â€œVery soon, you'll experience the change. The change of becoming a wolf.â€
A what?
I look at him in confusion, then burst out laughing.
He turns around and looks at me, his nostrils flaring â€œStop laughing. This is not a joke. I don't joke about things like this. By the look of things, it's going to happen pretty soon.â€
Surely he doesn't mean that I'm actually going to turn into a wolf because that's just crazy.
I roll my eyes, â€œOkay, I'll play along. What happens during this change?â€
â€œPain. A lot of pain.â€

Our bodies need some fat and it is best to get our fat from a natural source, not a

refined source. An example of a natural fat is an avocado. Natural fats can also be found

in nuts and seeds. An example of a refined or unnatural fat is corn oil, which is 100% fat.



116

It takes 12-14 ears of corn to produce one tablespoon of oil. And, ounce for ounce, fats

have over twice as many calories as sugar.



CHOLESTEROL AND HEART DISEASE



Cholesterol is a substance that can only be found in meat, poultry, and animal

products such as eggs, (3 egggs have as much cholesterol as 2 lbs. of hamburger) milk,

cheese, etc. Foods from the plant kingdom, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, etc.

do not contain any cholesterol. There are two types of cholesterol: High density

Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is the good kind that our body produces. The other is Low

Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which is the undesirable kind. Meats, animal

products, refined shortening, and oil (even though they themselves are cholesterol free)

are the foods most responsible for creating high cholesterol levels in our bodies.

Exercise is important for those who have heart disease, and also for those who

want to prevent heart disease. A daily walking program, outside in the fresh air and

sunshine, is very beneficial. Spas, gymnasiums, and work-out rooms are not

advantageous. Fresh air and sunshine, which are very important, are lacking in such

places. Those who are engaged in sedentary work, especial y, need more physical

outdoor exercise.

Several prescription drugs used to lower cholesterol have proven to be more

dangerous than therapeutic. As a result of the six-year Coronary Drug Project conducted

by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and published in 1975, two of the then commonly

prescribed drugs were abruptly taken off the market when the study showed that more

people died in the group taking the drugs than in the group taking a placebo(1).

There are many herbs that are good for the heart. Some of these are Blue Cohosh

(for heart palpitation), Borage, and Hawthorne Berry (to strengthen the heart). Always use

distil ed water when making herb tea. Bring water to a boil, remove from heat and add 1-2

tsp. herb per 8 oz of water. Cover and let steep for 20 minutes. Strain and drink.

HERBS





The great remedial properties of herbs have been recognized and appreciated

since time immemorial. Herbs were mentioned in the Bible from the beginning of creation.

Herbs are nature's medicine and have been put here by an al -wise Creator. See Psalm

104:141 and Ezekiel 47:12. There is an herb for every disease that a human body can be

afflicted with (mankind just does not know them al ).

The father of medicine, Hipprocates, was an herbalist. Herbs were used extensively

until about 1500 A.D. At that time a man by the name of Hohemhein started the practice of

using chemicals for the treatment of disease. Hohemhein burned in the public square al

the herb books of Hippocrates. Having this valuable information out of the way, the

medicine men fol owed the error of Hohemhein, who was the first to give the damaging

drug Mercury.

In public, the medical establishment puts down herbs as quackery. What hypocrisy!

What no one ever tel s you is that some of today's biggest drug companies such as E. I.

Lil y, Squibb, and Parke Davis started out sel ing herbs. E. I. Lil y himself started out

picking flowers and herbs by the side of the road. His one formula with the herb cascara

sagrada earned him enough money to launch his company.

Today, things are changing again - but it's happening quietly and no one is talking

about it too much. Did you know that in a recent year, over 130 mil ion prescription drugs

were written which came from plants? Or that over 75% of the hormones used in medicine

today are derived completely from plants.

In private, the drug companies are some of the biggest users of herbal research

libraries. That's what a head librarian told a fel ow researcher. He said the drug companies

were looking for old forgotten formulas for which they can get "grandfather" rights.

According to my understanding, "grandfather rights" means that the formula was

used before a certain date in the early 1900's for a certain disease. Then, under certain

conditions, a drug company could sel the same formula today - without having to spend

$50 to $200 mil ion to get it approved by the government.

You see one big reason - $$$$$ - why the drug companies might be interested in

old-time herbal formulas.

Drugs erode the general state of one's health. "It is known that about 40 percent of

people undergoing medical care suffer side effects from the medications given them, and



118

these reactions can leave a person "blind or deaf, afflicted with kidney, liver or brain

damage, bone necrosis, ulceration of the bowel, intestinal hemorrhage, skin scars,

extreme sensitivity to sunlight or other disabilities that may last for months or years(1).

You may be surprised to learn that even today over forty percent of prescription

drugs sold in the U. S. contain ingredients derived from nature; and a ful twenty-five

percent of drugs contain at least one compound derived directly or through chemical

modeling, from flowering plants.



Rules For Using Herbs

When you are sick - use herbs. When you are wel , leave them alone. A person

doesn't take medicine when he is wel , neither should you take herbs when you are wel ,

as they can throw the body off balance. Herbs can be taken internal y in different ways:

capsules, tinctures and tea form. The very best way is in tea form, as most al capsules

are made from gelatin which comes from an animal by-product. Tinctures are very

concentrated and have alcohol in them for a preservative. When you make your tea,

always use distil ed water or reverse osmosis filtered water as it wil absorb more of the

medicinal properties out of the herb than any other type of water. When using the leaves

or flowers of the herb, bring the water to a boil; remove from the heat and add the herb.

Let it steep for 20 minutes or longer, then strain and drink it. When using the part (???) or

bark you need to boil them for 30 â€“ 40 minutes then can strain and use. As a general rule

you would put one to two teaspoons of herb per eight ounces of water. It is best not to

mix/two herbs together at one time, as you have an interaction of the herbs with one

another. If you mix six herbs together just imagine how many different combinations you

can come up with! It would be the same as taking six numbers and seeing how many

ways you can write them down. If I'm using two herbs, they should each be made

separately and taken at different times. There are many poisonous herbs, which we would

never want to use and there are some herbs that have side effects, and need to be used

with discretion. W^ can never be too careful in our use of herbs.

There are many herbal books on the market that one can purchase. Of course, you

wil find many contradictions (as you do in any field). A safe rule of thumb is to buy 4 or 5

herbal books; look up the herb you are thinking about using in each one. If they al agree,

then try it. A great herbal book in print today that I would recommend is Medicinal Plants

(1990) by Steven Foster and Dr. James A. Duke, Houghton-Mifflin Company, Boston. This

book is authored by two individuals - an herbalist and a scientist.

Listed here are just a smal portion of herbs and some of their uses that I have

personal y used and seen results with. According to the World Health Organization, as

much as eighty percent of the world's population stil relies on traditional forms of medicine

such as herbs. Only those who know the value of herbal remedies can appreciate the

wonderful effects of the herbs that many tread under foot daily.

Editor's Note: This story was written back in the 1860's by my favorite author on

health, Ellen G. White. She was well over a hundred years ahead of her time. Here is

another one of her statements written at the same time. "More deaths have been

caused by drug-taking than from all other causes combined. If there was in the land

one physician in the place of thousands, a vast amount of premature mortality

would be prevented. Multitudes of physicians and multitudes of drugs, have cursed

the inhabitants of the earth, and have carried thousands and tens of thousands to

untimely graves."





The daughter was sick, and the father was much troubled on her account, and

summoned a physician. As the father conducted him into the sick room, he manifested a

painful anxiety. The physician examined the patient, and said but little. They both left the

sick room. The father informed the physician that he had buried the mother, a son and

daughter, and this daughter was al that was left to him of his family. He anxiously inquired

of the physician if he thought his daughter's case hopeless.

The physician then inquired in regard to the nature and length of the sickness of

those who had died. The father mournful y related the painful facts connected with the

il ness of his loved ones. "My son was first attacked with a fever. I cal ed a physician. He

said that he could administer medicine which would soon break the fever. He gave him

powerful medicine, but was disappointed in its effects. The fever was reduced, but my son

grew dangerously sick. The same medicine was again given him, without producing any

change for the better. The physician then resorted to stil more powerful medicines, but my

son obtained no relief. The fever left him, but he did not ral y. He sank rapidly and died.

The death of my son so sudden and unexpected was a great grief to us al ,

especial y to his mother. Her watching and anxiety in his sickness, and her grief

occasioned by his sudden death, were too much for her nervous system, and my wife was

soon prostrated. I felt dissatisfied with the course pursued by this physician. My

confidence in his skil was shaken, and I could not employ him a second time, I cal ed

another to my suffering wife. This second physician gave her a liberal dose of opium,

which he said would relieve her pains, quiet her nerves, and give her rest, which she

much needed. The opium stupefied her. She slept, and nothing could arouse her from the

death-like stupor. Her pulse and heart at times throbbed violently, and then grew more

and more feeble in their action, until she ceased to breathe. Thus she died without giving

her family one look of recognition. This second death seemed more than we could endure.

We al sorrowed deeply but I was agonized and could not be comforted.

My daughter was next afflicted. Grief, anxiety and watching, had overtaxed her

powers of endurance, and her strength gave way, and she was brought upon a bed of



121

suffering. I had now lost confidence in both the physicians I had employed. Another

physician was recommended to me as being successful in treating the sick. And although

he lived at a distance, I was determined to obtain his services,

This third physician professed to understand my daughter's case. He said that she

was greatly debilitated, and that her nervous system was deranged, and that fever was

upon her, which could be control ed, but that it would take time to bring her up from her

present state of debility. He expressed perfect confidence in his ability to raise her. He

gave her powerful medicine to break up the fever. This was accomplished. But as the

fever left, the case assumed more alarming features and grew more complicated. As the

symptoms changed, the medicines were varied to meet the case. While under the

influence of new medicines she would for a time, appear revived, which would flatter out

hopes, that she would get wel , only to make our disappointment more bitter as she

became worse. The physician's last resort was calomel. For some time she seemed to be

between life and death. She was thrown into convulsions. As those most distressing

spasms ceased, we were aroused to the painful fact that her intel ect was weakened. She

began slowly to improve, although stil a great sufferer. Her limbs were crippled from the

effect of the powerful poisons which she had taken. She lingered a few years a helpless,

pitiful sufferer, and died in much agony.11

After this sad narrative the father looked imploringly to the physician, and entreated

him to save his only remaining child. The physician looked sad and anxious, but made no

prescription. He arose to leave, saying that he would cal the next day.

The next day the physician was in the sick room, standing by the bedside of the

afflicted daughter. Again he left the room without giving medicine. The father, when in the

presence of the physician alone seemed deeply moved, and he inquired impatiently, "Do

you intend to do nothing? Wil you leave my only daughter to die?" The physician said, "I

have listened to the sad history of the death of your much loved wife, and your two

children, and have learned from your own lips that al three have died while in the care of

physicians, while taking medicines prescribed and administered by their hands. Medicine

has not saved your loved ones, and as a physician I solemnly believe that none of them

need, or ought to have died. They could have recovered if they had not been so drugged

that nature was enfeebled by abuse, and final y crushed. He stated decidedly to the

agitated father. "I cannot give medicine to your daughter. I shal only seek to assist nature

in her efforts, by removing every obstruction, and then leave nature to recover the

exhausted energies of the system" He placed in the father's hand a few directions which

he enjoined upon him to fol ow closely. "Keep the patient free from excitement, and every

influence calculated to depress. Her attendants should be cheerful and hopeful. She

should have a simple diet, and should be al owed plenty of pure soft water to drink. Bathe

frequently in pure soft water fol owed by gentle rubbing. Let the light and air, be freely

admitted into her room. She must have quiet, and undisturbed rest."

The father slowly read the prescription, and wondered at the few simple directions it

contained, and seemed doubtful of any good resulting from such simple means. Said the

physician, "You have had sufficient confidence in my skil to place the life of your daughter

in my hands.â€ Withdraw not your confidence, I wil visit your daughter daily, and direct you

in the management of her case. Fol ow my directions with confidence, and I trust in a few

weeks to present her to you in a much better condition of health, if not ful y restored."

The father looked sad and doubtful, but submitted to the decision of the physician.

He feared that his daughter must die if she had no medicine. At a later date the daughter

was sitting by the side of her father cheerful and happy, with the glow of health upon her

countenance. The father was looking upon her with happy satisfaction, his countenance

speaking the gratitude of his heart, that his only child was spared to him. Her physician



122

entered, and after conversing with the father and child for a short time arose to leave. He

addressed the father, thus, "I present to you your daughter restored to health. I gave her

no medicine that I might leave her with an unbroken constitution. Medicine never could

have accomplished this. Medicine deranges nature's fine machinery, and breaks down the

constitution, and kil s, but never cures. Nature alone possesses the restorative powers.

She alone can build up her exhausted energies, and repair the injuries she has received

by inattention to her fixed laws."

He asked the father if he was satisfied with his manner of treatment. The happy

father expressed his heart felt gratitude, and perfect satisfaction, saying, "I have learned a

lesson I shal never forget. It was painful, yet it is of priceless value. I am now convinced

that my wife and children need not have died. Their lives were sacrificed while in the

hands of physicians by their poisonous drugs."



GEORGE WASHINGTON: MEDICAL MARTYR





On December 13th, 1799, George Washington summoned his doctor after coming

down with a sore throat. His doctor bled him four times, injected him with poisonous

mercury, gave him more mercury by mouth, then blistered his throat with a compound of

vinegar and dead bugs. After enduring this torturous treatment for a single day, the Father

of Our Country begged his doctor to leave him alone and let him die in peace - which he

did, at 10:00 PM on December 14.



STATISTICS CONFIRMS HARMFUL USE OF DRUGS



100,000 deaths a year (over 300 per day), are caused by prescription

medications. This figure is only on those reported by hospitals or physicians.

Journal of the American Medical Ass. April 15, 1998



One would think that doctors contribute to a decrease in mortality rates. Ironical y,

however, the reverse happens. Statistics gathered during doctors strikes in 1973, 1976

and 1978 proved their absence coincided with decreased death rates. These are as

fol ows:



1973 - Israel 29 day physician strike - 50% less deaths reported by Jerusalem Burial

Society.

1976 - Columbia 52 day physician strike -35% decrease in deaths in BogotÃ¡,

Columbia confirmed by Morticians Association of Columbia.

1978 - Los Angeles Doctors went out on strike for two months and death rate fel by

35%. When they went back to work, the death rate increased by 40%.

In a 1980 American study, 20% of al patients admitted into hospitals suffered one

or more latrogenic episodes. This means one person out of five suffered from drug

reactions, negative reactions to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and ward

accidents. Medication errors were responsible for 11% of the mistakes!

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE





THE HEART

The human heart is red brown in color and weighs approximately 12 ounces. It is

about six inches long, and its widest point is four inches

across. It is more pear shaped than valentine shaped.

The great throbbing center of al human life and activity

is the heart. No other organ carries so much responsibility for

the rest of the body. When your heart is strong and healthy

the whole body benefits. When it is sick, the whole body

suffers. That is why it is so important for you to take care of

your heart.

Can a person strain his heart by overwork? No, it is

almost impossible to strain the healthy human heart by overwork. The heart is far more

likely to be damaged by disease and by poor habits of living than by any physical activity.

But once the heart has been damaged by disease, it may be necessary to avoid too much

activity. A heart that has been damaged can be strained beyond its limits.

The heart is a very efficient four-chambered pump, actual y two pumps, one to

move blood to the lungs, the other to push it out into the body. Every day it pumps blood

through 60,000 miles of blood vessels, and pumps enough blood to fil a 4,000 gal on

railroad car.

As long as you are alive, your heart never stops working. It has enormous reserve

powers to meet any crisis that may arise. If it has been damaged by disease, it repairs

itself while it works! If its valves become thickened because of some disease, such as

rheumatic fever, the heart wil thicken up its own muscular wal s to try to compensate for

any lack of efficiency. Even while your heart is working, its own muscle cel s are busy

selecting the materials they need for their own growth and repair.



PULSE RATE



Relatively little attention is paid these days to the heart rate or pulse. The heart

typical y beats 70-80 times a minute when an individual is sitting down. This adds up to

over 100,000 beats per day. However, under physical or mental stress the body requires

more oxygen and the heart accordingly steps up the pace to perhaps 150-200 beats a

minute.

Athletes have low pulses, especial y long distance runners, whose rates can

normal y be 35 to 40 beats per minute. Women's rates are general y higher than men's.

Children and babies have stil higher rates, from 80-150 beats per minute.

A healthy individual, who has a resting pulse rate of 70 beats per minute in

comparison with a weaker individual who has a resting pulse rate of 90 beats per minute,

wil not be over-taxing his heart. A difference

of 20 beats per minute over a 24 hour period adds up to 28,800 extra beats the weaker

individual's heart has to beat per day. Obviously, with everything else being equal, the

heart pumping away at a faster rate wil not last as long as one pumping at a slower rate.



125



The average individual has 51/2 quarts of blood and the normal heart at a normal

rate wil pump or recycle thousands of gal ons of blood every day.

The amount of blood pumped by the heart with each contraction can vary from 2 to

5 ounces per stroke. The heart with a high stroke volume and low pulse is a far stronger

and healthier organ than the heart with a low stroke volume and high pulse.

Since the heart has to beat 24 hours a day it has to get its rest in between beats.

The interval between beats is only half a second normal y, which seems like very little time

for the heart to rest and repair itself. But it's enough, and here's why. At the rate of 70

beats per minute the heart rests approximately half the time and works the other half. This

means that in a 24 hour period it gets 12 hours of rest. But if the heart rate goes up, the

extra beats take away from the rest period. So when your pulse is higher than 70 beats

per minute, your heart is working more than it is resting. At a rate of 90 beats per minute

it's on the job approximately two-thirds of the time and resting only one-third.



BLOOD PRESSURE



Blood pressure (BP) is the force the circulating blood exerts on the arterial wal s.

Blood pressure is categorized as systolic or diastolic blood

pressure.

They are expressed as: 120 Systolic pressure, 80 Diastolic

pressure.

The systolic pressure is the pressure the blood has against

the wal of the blood vessel while the heart is pumping or pushing

the blood. It is the maximum pressure the blood has on the arterial

wal at any one time. The diastolic pressure is the pressure the blood has against the wal s

of the blood vessel while the heart is resting. It is the constant pressure on the artery, or

the lowest pressure on the artery.
