“Don’t worry about it,” Aparna replied. “My quests aren’t as dangerous as yours.”
Gatril smacked Kiran with her tail. He winced and rubbed his thigh. “Ouch, Gatril!”
“Stop being so pushy already,” Gatril said. “The women don’t have time to be your little sex maids. Trewanti has blood to suck and Aparna has...animals to attend to.”
Kiran said, “Well good luck then, guys.”
“Thanks,” said Aparna. 
Trewanti remained silent, only shrugging. 
“When are you leaving, Kiran?” said Aparna.
“I think I’ll need about four days for my arm to heal,” said Kiran.
“So short?” said Gatril.
“Spirit energy can be used to heal the body,” said Kiran. “I need to start working on that spell too before the queex goes off.”
“Don’t worry,” said Trewanti, slightly opening her legs. “There’s always more when you need it, young sorcerer.”

CHAPTER FIVE

Three days of preparation, and the young wizard and his dragon accomplice were ready for the final leg of their journey. The morning started off with a hearty breakfast of oatmeal, bread and pork. They went over their equipment; Kiran mostly taking up that task.
Kiran had gotten some more supplies from the merchants in town, storing them in the back of his quacycle and backpack. Trewanti was the first to leave, transforming into her frightening form and flying back to the forest. Kiran and Gatril got onto the quacycle and rode off, waving back at the shrinking image of Aparna.
The quacycle’s wheels spun over miles of earth and grass uphill until their destination faded into sight. 
It was once called Ashfield Road, named after the legend of bodies that were burnt after a massive war between two tribes, and the crisp remains of the corpses had rained upon the land that day like dark snowflakes. But that was decades ago, and now lush trees that called all manner of wildlife within the surrounding greenage stood here, hence its new name the Preteblu Hills.
 Mongooses scuttled across the ground and gay birds chirps and flew overhead. The leaves ruffled like paper being crushed next to the ear in the winds, and for the briefest moment, the thought of confronting ferocious beasts slipped out of Kiran’s mind.
Gatril felt his muscles relax, and the quacycle slowed. “You feeling okay?”
“I’m good,” Kiran said.
Gatril tightened her arms around Kiran, and rested her chin atop his locks. Regardless of the barriers of their species and social standing, the comfort of his presence was too good to pass up on. 
“We’re almost there,” Kiran said.
And that was when their ambushers struck, barging out of the bushes with clubs, machetes and crude-looking blasters in hand. 
They were of the shape of men, hairy with a hyena’s snout and ears, hunched over with a mane of bristly hair running from their backs atop their heads. Grating cackles filled Kiran’s and Gatril’s ears, and they quickly stopped the quacycle and hopped off as the seven beasts surrounded them.
“What are they?” Kiran said, switching between the individuals, the stones in his staff already lambent from his spirit energy.
“Bultungins,” sneered Gatril. She forcefully flicked her tail around unpredictably, sending a message to the beasts one foul move would befall something horrible upon them.
They all wore various animal skins that had crudely torn edges, and all manner of trinkets that seemed to have sculpted by more skilled hands as opposed to the dirty, clawed ones of the bultungins.
Kiran knew the human crafts in particular the bultungins didn’t get by righteous means.
One with his mane dyed white approached them, eagerly tapping a femur tipped with an axe-head in his palm. He rose above them by inches, and the width of his shoulders told the pair a blow dealt by his hand would be fatal.
“Little meatballs,” he said, “you look like you’re a long way from home.”
“Yeah,” giggled one of the others, gesturing with his machete, “you tell ‘em boss.”
“Piss off!” said Gatril, keeping her eyes on the ones with blasters. “I’ll melt you all alive if you touch us!”
The leader grinned, and gobbets of saliva reeking of rotten flesh fell from his mouth. “Hey boy, hand over that quacycle and your stuff, or we’ll show you how our gang does things around here.”
Kiran touched Gatril, stealing her attention. She saw the glow of his spirit energy in the jewels on his staff, and face laced with concentration. She realized his stance wasn’t that of a coward seeking someone to save him from his demise, but a man trying to gather his bearings to access the situation.
Kiran wasn’t afraid anymore.
“Last warning,” said Kiran, unflinching, “leave us alone.”
Two of the bultungins charged and abruptly stopped, baring their teeth. It was a tactic meant to inject fear and unease into their targets, but Kiran’s countenance reflected his inward annoyance rather than the terror they’d hope to see.
Realizing this, the leader couldn’t let this standoff continue with words. He dropped his axe by his side, tensing his arm. “Don’t say I didn’t try to play nice. Get ‘em!”
And Kiran tapped the ground with his staff. Earthen walls sprung up with multiple quakes, catapulting two bultungin into the air and barricading Kiran and Gatril from their gunfire.
Gatril instantly followed up by jumping onto one of the walls and into a bultungin with a gun. She twisted her body and slapped him away with her tail. She sprinted on all fours, darting left and right, tripping them with her tail and cutting them open with her claws.
“Blast!” The leader turned and ran. “Let’s get outta here!”
The remaining two men fled with their boss. 
But Kiran wasn’t having it, and he holsters his staff and took out his cannon. Kiran aimed it at the bultungin running through the trees and fired with honed precision. The sticky blob knocked the leader in the head and grounded him.
Gatril darted after the others and leaped into the back of one with the force of a raging bull. She heard a loud snap of something vital to the beast, and switched to the other one. Gatril hawked up an acidic ball that splattered onto his back. The bultungin wailed at the sound of his sizzling flesh; like fresh lava had been poured onto him.
Kiran went to the quacycle to check if he had accidentally damaged his vehicle in the ruckus, while Gatril dragged the leader back to the side of the road.
Gatril tossed him by his foot unceremoniously before Kiran. “Start yapping,” she said.
The cowering bultungin raised his trembling hands before him as if he expected one of the two to stomp-in his face. “I-I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to attack you!”
“Where did you get all those ornaments?” said Kiran.
“We found them in a town up ahead,” he said. “It was overrun by the j’bafofi. The entire place has been murdered. The only people there are the dead ones. W-We just happened on it and found all this jewelry. Then they chased us out!”
“They…?” said Gatril.
“The males!” the beasts said, his lips wet with disdain. “The bastards chased us out. They want all the territory for themselves to farm food to impress the female.”
“Thanks for the information,” said Gatril, kicking the man in ribs. “Now get going!”
But the bultungin couldn’t move from the hellish pain Gatril inflicted on him, and the two simply went the quacycle and left the squirming gang of beasts. 
Another path veered off the main one into a hazed outline of buildings, and they followed it. Though the wind blew, the tees barely moved as if they were petrified, and the birds didn’t take to them either. But the closer Kiran and Gatril got, they saw the reason for this.
A galaxy of webs had been thrown over the trees like a white sheet stretched to the thinnest fiber. They knitted the leaves and branches dead stiff, preventing the grace of the winds from permitting them a swaying dance. Hung within them like the leftover of a demented child’s macabre play things were dried corpses of animals who’d fallen prey.
And on their path into the town, it was no different. The webs were all over the buildings, and Kiran decided he better save his vehicle from going further into the webbed museum and turned off the engine. He and Kiran got off, looking for anything that waited to surprise them. 
“Do you smell anything, Gatril?” said Kiran.
Gatril’s nose inhaled the choking smell of rotten wood, alkaline and something dead. “Nothing out of the ordinary,” she said. “I never picked up the scent of a j’bafofi before.
Kiran saw the unattended windows and doors. It ran across his mind to search them, but he remembered something about spiders. They were creatures of stealth, lying in wait for something to carelessly wonder into their trap of threads and deliver a paralyzing blow, leaving the prey defenses as its organs were liquified and consumed alive.
A most gruesome ending Kiran didn’t want him and his friend to fall to.
“Gatril,” he said. “Either they’re hiding in the buildings, or they’re out hunting.”
“Then what do we do?” she said. “Should we lay the trap here? This isn’t the queen’s lair.”
Kiran considered his options, and said, “I guess I’ll take that chance.” 
He went to his quacycle, only to have a six-legged fiend fall off a roof onto it. 
It had a glaring pink-red coloration, and a pale face with beady black eyes above two nostrils and its jittering mouthparts that possessed actual human teeth.
Kiran screamed and ran away, stopping once next to the muscular bosdrake. “Eeek! Spider!”
Gatril took the cannon Kiran gave her off her back and positioned the arachnid within her sights. She had previously switched the sticky rounds with a cartridge that held eight lead bullets.
Just one of these creatures made the bosdrake and human nervous, and when more of them crawled out of the houses, unconditional terror embraced them.
“There are dozens of them!” said Kiran, looking at the spiders blocking off all exits. Their thoraxes were long, narrow and flexible, a design granting them the ability to aim their spinnerets over their heads. Their front legs were modified into three-digit grasping appendages. Their mouths made clicking and snapping sounds that Kiran’s ears couldn’t translate.
“Gatril, can you understand them?” he said.
“I’m not familiar with their language I’m afraid,” she said. She saw them inching their way closer. She roared, they snapped into a quick retreat, but advanced once again. All of this spoke to Gatril. They didn’t have the intelligence of beasts to know what a gun was or the power she and Kiran possessed. They moved purely on instinct. Confident in their numbers that their prey would go down.
“Kiran,” said Gatril. “We don’t have a choice now…” 
“Do it!” said Kiran, covering his mouth and nose with his shirt.
Gatril inhaled for a big air push and exhaled, spinning as she spread the green mist. The spiders railed in displeasure. Enraged sounds channeling from their mandibles.
Kiran blasted away two of the spiders. “Run to the back of the town!” 
Gatril and Kiran made toward a street. It was walled off by webs—until Gatril melted it with acid. But the further the pair went, the more spiders they saw coming at them. 
Kiran and Gatril had a little more speed as opposed to the spiders burdened by their hard exoskeleton; which they compensated for with the long reach of their spewing webs at the feet of the fleeing duo.
Gatril burned them another passage through the webs, and a third. Kiran used his earth-pillar and made a path over the webs on the ground and the spiders coming from the sides. Gatril took a few shots that popped messy yellow holes in their hides. The spiders screamed and collapsed. Kiran used his force-counter and knocked away three more of the spiders into the side of a house.
Their persistence led them to a path into a thin forest where they found more deceased animals entangled in the webs, and a smell of stale urine and moss assailed their senses like a stealthy, stinky predator.
But in the distance, Kiran and Gatril saw it.
“There’s a cave!” said Gatril, her keen eyesight catching it before the human.
The dark hollow was supplanted into the side of a high mound. Threads stained in yellow split from the mouth and matted around it. The plants were withered as if the threads were robbing them of life, and the pungent smell tripled.
Kiran spun around with his staff, ready. But to his surprise the spiders hesitated. “Look, they stopped.”
Gatril witnessed the once bloodthirsty arachnids stalling, placing their feet forward and back, hesitant as their food was so close, yet so was the abode of the female. 
“Are they afraid of the female?” said Gatril.
“At least they aren’t going to kill us anymore.” Kiran took Gatril’s arm and walked back into the cave, keeping his eyes on the males just in case they mustered enough courage to come closer. 
The sunlight died soon inside, and Kiran felt goosebumps all over him. “We forgot the lantern back on the quacycle,” he said. “Gatril, can you by any chance breathe fire yet?”
“Not naturally like my stomach acid,” she said. “If we had some potassium and glycerin to eat I could though.”
Kiran channeled his spirit energy into his staff. “I guess it’s a good thing I made this spell with Trewanti’s queex.”
Kiran activated his fourth spell from a white orb with blue streaks. Light swelled from it, forming its photons into the shape of an eye. The iris sparkled and a second body of radiance stung the dark out of existence, revealing a rocky ceiling from which twisting roots ran into the walls and floor, all covered in moss. Insects who relished the dark hurried from the scorching light exuding from Kiran’s staff.
“Shall we?” said Kiran.
Gatril shoved Kiran along. “Stop trying to sound all fancy like.”
Kiran and Gatril found two separate, winding paths. The angle making it seem the lumpy walls intended to close and chew them up. The first one they took revealed insects and small rodents who expertly traverse the surface of the web-laden walls and ceiling. It seemed to have been an adaptation, which made Gatril in particular wonder how long the j’bafofi had been here.
The width of the path grew as they went, seeming more befitting of the massive beast fabled to live inside here. Then they reached the end, but contrary to the fangs, claws and beady eyes they were expecting, a mass of corpses piled on top of each other stood at the end, waiting on them like some sick trick.
“Holy crap…” Kiran tried to contain the urge to vomit, triggered by the scent that burnt his lungs. 
“They’re hundreds of them,” said Gatril.
The corpses were a menagerie of humans, beasts and animals, like a deranged necromancer’s collection. The ones at the very bottom were nothing but bones infused with moss and other discoloration over time, while at the top the newcomers still had their skin, though it was shriveled, and with the impact of the moisture had sagged and fused with heat of the others as if they were all trying to become one—souls locked together in an embrace of death. 
Kiran pointed the light above the bodies, where they found a tunnel leading to probably the source of where all these remains came from.
Kiran shuddered as if he could feel multiple hairy legs on him. “It’s like this place is—”
“A dumpster,” Gatril finished. She saw rats scrabbling to the top where others nibbled at the scraps of flesh left. “Come. We should go.”
They went back to the beginning of the fork in the cave and took the other path. This one was larger, very. Big enough to permit an elephant passage. Gatril’s intuition gnawed at her body and she readied her cannon. Kiran drew his knife just for safe measure.
And it came so unsuspectingly that it had the same effect as something leaping out of the dark to bite them. A sweet tune, a hum that came from a throat of liquid crystal. It was soft and reassuring, like the lullabies Kiran’s mother would sing to him.
“What? Who is that?” Kiran wondered if the cave was playing tricks on him. The song was unbefitting of the accursed hole they’d wondered into. It had to be a trap; a siren’s song to lure wary sailors to their doom, as his grandfather would tell Kiran at night when he visited the old man.
And then came an orange glow from around the bed. Faint, flickering, casting jagged shadows on the walls.
“Are you sure we’re in the right place?” said Kiran.
Gatril gestured to the ground briefly. “The webs here are a bit fresh. And now that I know the scent of spiders, it’s like this one’s right under my nose.”
They closer they got the slowler their steps became. But it seemed by the room they found, they had been right to be so cautious in their approach.
A flame burnt in a bronze urn close to the wall, and the essence of freshly sundered wood and mint seeped from it. Thick branches were stuck to the walls of the chamber, holding enough books that seemed to be the humble beginnings of a library. In the corners of the room were trinkets, jewelry that sparkled from the grace of the flames. And in the center, there she was.
It was something humanoid, female in shape, but the body parts composed of jointed limbs and a segmented torso. She had four long arms, each ending in four digits, and her pelvis was squishy looking and pink, contrasting the brown of her chitinous body. The thighs were thick and attached to the outermost of pelvis, from which a long tail hung, tipped with spinnerets. Her six eyes were occupied by a book before, her mandibles clicking thoughtfully as she processed the information, and she briefly brushed back a lock of her black hair with a hand.
But the legs weren’t set in preparation for a lunging attack. The hands weren’t about to wring their necks, and her fangs weren’t dripping neurotoxin in the hindsight of puncturing their flesh. Even when she lifted her head from the book she was reading and spared them a glance, she looked away, only to do a double take as if surprised by who was there instead of the fact that they snuck up upon her.
“Who are you two?” she said, her voice high pitched but grainy.
“My name is Kiran Kehomba,” the boy said. “I’m sorcerer seeking the queex of a j’bafofi. I came here seeking your assistance.”
The six eyes turned to the bosdrake. “And who is this?” the spider said.
“I’m Gatril,” she said. “I’m his friend.”
The spider closed the book, and between her mandibles they could see her lips making a smile. “This is quite the surprise. I was just reading a tale about a human female, falling in love with a beast. To think I’d see something similar even here. The universe must like me.”
Kiran said, “I don’t mean to be rude, mam, but I want to ask you a few questions.”
“You come into my domain, and want to question me?” the spider narrowed her eyes.
Kiran and Gatril’s nerves went array, and their spines wanted out through their backs,
“Shit,” said Gatril. “Quick, Kiran offer to eat her crotch!”
Kiran was a stuttering wreck: “I-I-I-I—”
“Enough!” said Gatril. She approached the spider, flinching when she saw the size of her mandibles. Seven inches. The size of Kiran’s cock. “Now look here!” Gatril pointed, but her finger was too close to the spider’s face and she dropped it. “We just—”
The spider grabbed Gatril by the throat. Gatril tired prying her hand open but the spider’s strength was more than hears, a mighty dragon.
Kiran’s spine suddenly straightened in his back. “Gatril!” He approached the spider. His staff raised with orb for the force-counter pulsing. “Put her down! Please!”
“My,” the spider said, her mandibles salivating. “I’ve never had a dragon before.”
“Bitch!” Gatril squeaked.
“I said drop her!” Kiran boomed.
The spider finally recognized Kiran’s killing intent and payed him heed. She sensed a supernatural force emanating from his staff, and narrowed two of her eyes at him. “You’re a sorcerer…”
“That’s right,” Kiran said, trying his best to contain his rage. “Now put her down before I tear this place down!”
The spider dropped Gatril, not out of fear, but intrigue with the human. Gatril gasped for air and retreated behind Kiran. “You freaky bug! The next time you do that you’ll regret it!”
The spider rose, tendons and chitinous body parts rubbing together like sandpaper. At three meters, she towered over them.
“Human, how many spells do you know?” said the spider.
“Four,” said Kiran. He and Gatril looked at each other with uncertainty. 
“Why would a spider be interested in spells?” said Gatril.
“Isn’t it obvious by what your eyes see?” said the arachnid. “I’ve become enlightened. I no longer thrive on my instincts except to feed to maintain my health.”
“Is that why you haven’t laid any eggs?” said Gatril.
“Yes,” she replied. “I’ve recently stopped accepting offers from the males. They are lowly beasts. Not bright in the head. I’ve sharpened my mind, nourishing it with the knowledge of humans.”  She showed them her hand, conjuring within it a ghostly white energy that danced like a swirling mist.
“That’s…spirit energy,” Kiran said.
The spider closed her hand and the energy vanished. “I’ve grown fond of this power that some humans possess, to point where I managed to discover it in myself. Kiran, if you can teach me about magic, I can give you the queex you want.”
“What?” Gatril turned to Kiran, expecting to see him speechless just like her, but the boy smiling much to her dismay.
“Wow!” said Kiran. “That sounds like a fair trade.”
Gatril grabbed Kiran by the shoulders and quickly walked him back to the mouth of the room. “What are you doing?” Gatril whispered.
“What’s wrong?” said Kiran.
Gatril pinched his lips. She looked over her shoulder at the spider’s six eyes visually ravaging her. Gatril flinched and turn to Kiran. “You can’t teach her magic. You’ve seen what she did to those bodies. Imagine if she starts walking around with a bunch of spells.”
Kiran’s train of thought came an abrupt stop, reversing to take another route that brought him upon a different outcome. “Oh, no,” he said.
“I can hear you, you know,” said the spider.
Kiran and Gatril spun around with innocent smiles. “Umm, you might have misheard,” said Kiran. “We were just talking about how pretty your vagina looks?”
The spider flexed her arms. “You don’t have much of a choice,” she said. “Either teach me about magic and get my queex, or I trap you here until you change your mind. One scream, and all the males will come running in at my side.”
“Then we’ll just have to make this quick,” said Kiran, raising his staff.
The spider flicked her tail and unleashed her webs in an arc. Gatril and Kiran dove out of the way of the silky strands.
Kiran used his force-counter spell, but the j’bafofi leapt into the ceiling. She uttered a high pitched clicking sound that froze Kiran and Gatril.
“Shit!” Gatril said. She opened fire at the spider but the J’bafofi was too fast; scurrying over the surface of the room, spewing more webs that threatened to fill the area. Gatril quickly spat an acidic mist around her that melted the webs, and the j’bafofi seized the opportunity, lunging with a kick that threw Gatril into the wall.
The spider hissed and lunged once more, only to have a column of rock punch her in the stomach. She winced and crumpled, quickly leaping into the ceiling.
Kiran lifted a large rock out of the floor again and launched it with his force-counter. “Got you!” he said.
But the j’bafofi caught the rock and attached it to a thread of silk from her tail. “Thank you,” she sneered.
Kiran felt something heavy drop in his gut when the spider threw the rock at him. Luckily Gatril already got up and dove with Kiran out of the way. The she-spider used the rock and silk like a flail, constantly trying to smashed the human and bosdrake, forcing them all over the room, tripping and kicking over books in their way.
“Kiran!” said Gatril as she ducked beneath the flying rock. “Get me some higher ground!”
“Got it!” said Kiran, tapping the floor and ascended Gatril atop a column. At this height Gatril got a better shot, and managed to put a round in the spider’s shoulder.
The j’bafofi screamed and drop the rock, falling to the floor ground with brute force.
Gatril laughed. “Stay down bitch!”
But unbeknownst to the dragon, a single strand of silk as thick as her pinky had flowed from the spider’s tail and attached to Gatril’s foot. The dragon only found out when the spider yanked her tail and snagged Gatril’s footing from beneath her.
Gatril fell into the j’bafofi’s grasp. The spider held her arms and legs with all of hers. She brought Gatril closer to her impending, salivating fangs. Kiran leaped at the spider with his staff, only to have her tail coil around him.
However, Kiran’s hand with the staff was free, and he looked to the ceiling with epiphany. I hope this works! Kiran thought, and he charged his staff with spirit energy and tossed it into the ceiling.
“I never ate a dragon before,” the spider said with insidious grin behind her fangs.
Gatril bore her teeth in defiance. She tried hawking up some more acid but her stomach’s content had reached its limit. But that proved unnecessary, as Gatril has the pleasure of seeing a huge rock land in the j’bafofi’s head with a solid thonk sound.
The she-spider’s eyes rolled into her head. Her grip loosened and the bosdrake and human quickly stepped away from the beasts as she fell on her knees. 
Kiran took up his staff and said, “Quick, tie her up!”
Gatril used her rifle as a club across the spider’s face, measuring the force so that it didn’t cause further damage, but dealt enough force to knockout her—which it did.
“Bitch!” said Gatril.
Kiran and her quickly bounded the j’bafofi’s six arms and legs together, as well as her tail. They sat her up against the wall, where by the time she regained consciousness she was looking across at Kiran and Gatril who’d seated themselves on some of her books.
“Well look who’s up?” said Gatril, closing a book she had been reading. 
The j’bafofi tried to lunge at Gatril but instantly met with the force of her restraints. “Curses!” The she-spider struggled, but Kiran and Gatril had used a good amount of webbing to tie her that would’ve restrained even a raging bull.
“Save your energy, missy,” said Gatril. “Because we’re going to work you.”
Kiran stood, and said, “Please listen to what we have to say—”
“As if I’d take orders from my food,” said the spider. “Just wait until I get free! I’ll liquefy your organs and drink them like soup!”
“We can free you right now if you cooperate,” said Gatril. 
The j’bafofi for the first time took a keen interest in Gatril. “A drake taking the orders of a human. Did he cast a spell on you?”
“No, I didn’t,” said Kiran. “She can leave or kill me whenever she wants. She just knows the kind of person I am and trusts me.”
The j’bafofi looked at the bosdrake quizzically, then chuckled. “This is a very strange thing indeed. I hear your words human, but I still don’t trust you. What do you want with me?”
“I told you before,” said Kiran. “I just want your queex. Once I get that, I’ll leave you alone. So long as you promise not to eat anymore humans or beasts.”
“Ferrans,” she said. 
“What?” Kiran said.
“We are ferrans,” said the j’bafofi. “We who are not human, but part human and part beast, are not simple-minded creatures. A monster is a mindless force of destruction, and beasts are just smart enough to be a human’s pet. Ferran are those on the same level of intelligence and social development as humans.”
Kiran turned to Gatril, confused and dumbfounded. Gatril herself seemed puzzled too, but she had a knowing air about her.
“Have you heard of this before?” said Kiran. Gatril turned her eyes away, but Kiran had already seen the thoughtful, knowing look in them. “What is it, Gatril?”
“You’re young, Kiran, so you wouldn’t know,” said Gatril. “Some beasts have started to form their own communities, even cities. Those in those places are starting a movement to organize the beasts into their own identity. Ferran comes from the word feral and human; meaning one as powerful as humans, yet untamed by humans.”
“R-Really?” said Kiran. The boy snatched up his bestiary and skipped through the pages. “I know they form clans but nothing as big as that!”
“That’s why I said not to trust books written by just humans,” said Gatril. “Humans have a tendency to permit only what’s beneficial to them to exist. You, spider, what is your name?”
“Shirksire,” she said. 
Gatril said, “Are you from one of these ferran cities, Shirksire?”
“Yes,” Shirksire said. “A long time ago I was exiled because of my belief that humans will never see me as equal. When I found this cave the town soon learned I was hear and tried to kill me. I defended myself—”
Kiran slapped the book shut, startling both women. Kiran put it down and looked at Shirksire testily. “That doesn’t give you the right to kill the entire town.”
“Don’t lecture me on morals, human!” Shirksire barked. “How many ferrans have you killed and skinned, beheaded and boiled down to the bone just to keep as your trophies? I only killed those who entered my cave to kill me. Their weapons are over there in the corner. The males caught wind of me here and did the rest. Besides…I doubt the entire town died. Probably some humans escaped. If the two of you can get past those idiot males, then there’s a good chance they did.”
Gatril turned to Kiran to see what his response would be. She didn’t want to tell him she mostly agreed with Shirksire; that she didn’t see anything wrong with killing and eating humans who came after them. But her interactions with Kiran and previous humans couldn’t fully make her accept the mindless killing of humans without reason.
However, her answer from Kiran was an unexpected one. He got up, took out his knife and began cutting the webs at Shirksire’s feet.
“What are you doing?” said Gatril, getting up with the gun in her hands.
“Showing her forgiveness,” said Kiran as he finished removing the webs from around Shirksire’s feet. “She doesn’t trust humans. But I’ll show her trust—Shirksire.”
The j’bafofi sat patiently while Kiran cut away her restraints. But she still didn’t move, courtesy of the gun aimed at her. When Kiran was finished, he went to Gatril and gestured for her to lower the gun.
“Are you sure about this Kiran?” Gatril said.
“…I haven’t been wrong yet,” said Kiran. He turned to Shirksire. “If you don’t trust me, you should at least trust another ferran…”
Shirksire waited on Gatril, and finally the bosdrake pointed the gun away from the j’bafofi. Shirksire slowly stood, flexing the stiffness out of her limbs. She looked down at the pair and said, “You are foolish for thinking you can make friends out of all your enemies, boy.”
“Are you my enemy?” said Kiran.
Shirksire sighed. “Fine…You win, human.”
Kiran smiled. “In that case…” He quickly pulled down his trouser and underwear and began stroking his penis. “Let’s get started…”
Shirksire flinched and backed away. “S-So soon?”
“What?” said Gatril. “You’ve never seen a penis before?”
Shirksire saw the quickly increasing size of Kiran’s cock and grew uneasy. “The males…they do not have one so…thick…”
Kiran chuckled. “Don’t worry, it won’t do you anything much.” Now Kiran was fully erect and bobbing with the pulsing blood flow.
Still uneasy, Shirksire said, “How would we begin…?”
“On your knees and suck it,” said Gatril. 
“Y-You mean…in my mouth?” said Shirksire.
“Of course.” Gatril approached Shirksire and yanked on one of her arms. “The sooner you do it, the quicker you’ll get use to it. Now come on. This is great trust building.”
Shirksire reluctantly stooped, now eye-level with Kiran. She took his warm member and gently stroked it. “I swear, human. If you ever double-cross me I’ll eat you alive.”
“You’re about to do it anyways,” said Kiran.
Shirksire understood the joke too clearly and bit her lip in embarrassment. “Damn human…”
Shirksire’s mandibles pulled apart and she brought her mouth towards Kiran’s penis. She stuck her tongue out and brushed it against the tip. She licked it and made a funny face that Kiran smiled at. Then Gatril suddenly shoved her by the back of the head and all of Kiran entered her. 
Shirksire chocked and grabbed Kiran.
“Come no now!” said Gatril, repeatedly shoving her head onto the young man’s rod. “Flick your tongue around it and swallow.”
Shirksire did as she was told. Kiran winced and moaned as Shirksire’s tongue startled to get the better of him. Gatril let go of Shirksire’s head, and the she-spider started steadily sucking Kiran, closing her eyes as she got into her rhythm and stuck with it.
Gatril decided to play her part, and got behind the j’bafofi and reached over her thigh for Shirksire’d already slick vagina. As Gatril rubbed her swollen clitoris she began to moan with Kiran, her other hands gripping her thigh as Kiran tightened his hand on her hair.
Once Gatril felt her fingers becoming sufficiently most she brought around the bowl beneath Shirksire. She started dripping inside it. Gatril removed her hand and tasted it. “Hmmm…”
“Bring it here…” said Kiran, his face contorting with pleasure.
Gatril got up and put her hand to Kiran’s mouth. He sucked her fingers and met a tangy taste of something like a sour fruit and raw meat. Kiran leaned into Gatril with a kiss, and slid his finger inside her crotch—abruptly gripped Shirksire’s head, stiffened and tipped on his toes. “Ooooooh!”
Kiran exploded inside Shirksire’s mouth. The j’bafofi pulled away and gagged. She cupped her hand under her chin and opened her mouth to let his semen slide off her tongue and into her palm.
Kiran sighed loudly and staggered back into Gatril’s embrace. “Oh man…”
Shirksire flicked her hand and flung the semen on the floor. She turned to Kiran, wiping her mouth. “You could’ve told me you were going to do that.”
“Sorry,” said Kiran. “I got lost in the moment You were really good for your first time…”
“I’m a quick learner,” said Shirksire. She took up the wait bowl from beneath her and looked in it. “But I haven’t reached my orgasm yet.”
“Oh, don’t worry,” said Kiran, holding his still sturdy penis. “I still have a round left inside me.”
Surprised, Shirksire stood up. “Again? Already?”
Gatril said, “That’s how we do it. Now get on your hands and knees. I want to try a position I always thought about.”
“Please,” Shirksire said, “nothing drastic.” She leaned over, and Gatril carefully climbed onto her back. “W-What—”
“I see,” said Kiran. He positioned himself behind Shirksire, his hip in line with her bottom, his face with Gatril’s. Kiran caressed Gatril’s vagina with his tongue while slowly thrusting his penis inside Shirksire.
Shirksire’s body tense and she moaned, feeling every inch of Kiran’s member press against her walls. Gatril bit her lips and gyrated her bottom in Kiran’s face while he slowly thrusted in and out of Shirksire.
Kiran started slow as usual, making sure to savor the taste of Gatril and the feeling inside Shirksire. Both women’s moans filled the cave, and got increasingly louder as Kiran picked up the pace. Kiran’s tongue moved friskily now, making Gatril wiggle and tense spasmodically. His thrusting hips slapped his testicles against Shirksire and she became more tender, arching her back. 
Kiran squeezed Gatril’s bottom for support as his mouth dug into her, until she yelled and sprayed her fluids into his mouth. Kiran hung onto her and lapped up everything, while Shirksire succumbed to the relentless pounding inside her and reached her own climax. A very loud, wet and warm one.
Kiran finished up with another load of semen that stung the Shirksire’s cervix.
“Ouch!” was her response.
Finally drained, Kiran fell on his back. Shirksire collapsed and Gatril rolled off her. All three individuals were on the floor, and one by one they all fell asleep.

When they woke up Kiran quickly made the spell, with Shirksire seated before him and looking intently.
“So you can only use queex?” said Shirksire.
“No,” Kiran said as he mixed the contents in the bowl. “But in my case it makes for a unique spell, plus I also want the battle experience.”
“…I see,” Shirksire said. “Are you sure you are not a sexplorer?”
Kiran laughed. “Don’t get me wrong, I love sex, but not as much as I love magic.” Kiran finished making a white orb with grey ripples. He tossed between his hands, waiting for it to dry. “However, I still feel a little urge to have intercourse with bea…ferrans. They have such different flavors.”
“Are you his girlfriend, bosdrake?” Shirksire said.
“Friend with benefits,” Gatril replied. “You can join the group too, if you want.”
Shirksire pontificated on the offer, tapping her index finger from three of her hands. “I would love to have someone teach me magic, but I…”
Kiran was putting the orb into the fifth and final socket when he looked up at Shirksire’s troubled expression. “What is it?”
Shirksire said, “I feel much safe in this cave than outside.”
“Trust me,” said Gatril, “someone like you wouldn’t have much to fear. You just need to mark out your own territory. You can even stay with me if you wan to.”
“Really…?” Shirksire said, half rising from her seat. 
“Of course,” said Gatril. “I’m close to where Kiran lives. He can always visit us.”
Then Shirksire’s elation dwindled when she realized something. “…But my books…There are a lot of them.”
“If you’ve ready read them, then you don’t need them anymore,” said Kiran. “If you were trying to learn magic, they obviously weren’t helpful.”
Shirksire smiled. “Your offer does sound tempting. I must considerate, though.”
“No problem,” said Kiran, getting up. “Now let’s see if this works…”
Kiran channeled his spirit energy into the staff and pointed to the gun next to Gatril. A thick strand of silk spewed from the orb and attached to the weapon, and Karin yanked it towards him and caught it.
“A web…” Shirksire remarked.
“Just in case I can’t reach something from where I am,” said Kiran. “So, shall we all leave? This cave is getting a bit cramped now.”
Shirksire got up. “Right this way…”
Shirksire lead them to out of the cave into the ruins of the town, where the male spiders awaiting them, peering from atop the buildings and inside through the windows. However, any thoughts of making an attack on the human and bosdrake where stalled by the presence of their female.
“What will you do about them?” said Gatril as she walked by the arachnids.
“I’ll still keep them around as a deterrent from travelers,” Shirksire said, watching Kiran hurry towards his quacycle and check for any damages. 
The sun was setting in the distance, and long shadows were strewn from the trees across the ground. The air was cool, and Kiran felt relaxed now that his entire mission was complete. When they were out on the highway, Kiran and Gatril faced Shirksire, about to say their final goodbyes.
“When will you be back?” said Shirksire.
“Within a month’s time, after the tournament is finished,” said Kiran. “If I get my sorcerer’s license, I can keep beasts…or ferrans as my pets. In this case, you would be my partner. It means you could walk amongst human’s freely without any persecution. Then we can study new magic together.”
Shirksire smiled. “I like the sound of that.” She knelt over Kiran, held his cheeks and kissed him on his forehead. “I’ll be seeing you, Kiran…”
“You too, Shirksire,” said the young man.
“We should get going,” said Gatril. “bultungins usually get active at night. And we already pissed off a gang of them.”
Kiran and Gatril got on the quacycle and rode off, while Shirksire walked back to the town. 
“Well,” said Gatril, “you’ve acquired all your spells, young sorcerer. I guess you only need to prepare for your grand debut at the tournament.”
Kiran said, “Yeah, but that’s only the first part. After that I’ll need to raise money doing a lot of missions. I still remember my promise to carry you to Puzzland. And I want to discover different magical artifacts on the uncharted continents.”
Gatril’s arms slinked around Kiran affectionately. “Do you think we can say we are boyfriend and girlfriend now?”
“That’s if you mind sharing,” said Kiran. “The uncharted worlds are really dangerous, so I’ll need as much support as I can get. I think I really will each Shirksire how to use magic. Heck, maybe all the other girls can join me.”
“So long as you eat my crotch the most, I don’t mind,” said Gatril.
Kiran looked over his shoulder at Gatril, and said, “Don’t worry, you’ll always be my main girl.”
Gatril’s mouth was slightly ajar, and she closed it. She smiled at Kiran and kissed his cheek. 
Kiran turned his attention back to the road, grinning. Have I got a story for you, grandpa.

CHAPTER ONE

After several months of preparation, now came Kiran’s time to prove his worth. Dressed in a red tunic adorned in golden swirls on the hems, and grey trousers beneath, he carefully crept through the lush bushes in search of his target. Apart from a compact, metal cannon in a bronze frame, Kiran had a knapsack on his back with his various necessities inside, along with a staff he placed through a strap on his bag.
Most of the sunlight was hidden by the thickness of the jungle’s trees, and Kiran had to rely on the effectiveness of his eyes. The parts of the soil present had a sandy tone and texture, however Kiran was more focused on following the footprints of his prey. He occasionally looked up to see his surroundings, knowing he was not the only one out here on the hunt.
Focus, Kiran, he thought. This is your only chance.
Kiran, at sixteen years old, needed to obtain a special ingredient in order to start preparing the spells for the tournament, and that vital ingredient he needed, was right before him nibbling on a few fallen mangos.
Among all the beasts on the continent of Aardel, bosdrakes were one of the rarest. They were few in numbers, and said to only lay ten eggs every twenty years. Some said it was a curse from the gods as a means of curving the rise in numbers of the powerful creatures, but the bosdrakes never were the type to tell.
The typical bosdrake was ten meters tall from head to toe, with a thick tail half its height, capable of levelling small trees in one swing. But the one before Kiran was around five feet tall, fairly young. It had yellow skin and a stocky build, it’s thick arms and legs ending in four digits with large talons. It had a large head with a blunt snout, and its eyes were bright green and its mouth wide. The bosdrake had two rows of orange studs on its head that ran all the way down to its tail that coiled against its back, with green hair set in a drooping mohawk—unlike Kiran’s hair was braided into ten individual locks. This bosdrake in particular also wore a necklace of red and copper stones and square wood carvings.
Besides the smoothness of its jaw and the eyelashes, Kiran could tell it was a female by its exposed genitals; a plump labia with dark lips and round breasts. The sight of it caused blood to rush down Kiran’s groin, and he had to briefly pause and wait till his thoughts settled.
The bosdrake hummed a sweet tune as she sat on her bottom beneath the tree, entertaining her eyes with the swaying branches as she ate.
Now’s my chance! Kiran thought. He lifted his cannon and looked along the iron sight. Kiran made sure he had the bosdrake’s head in view, and pulled the trigger. The hammer struck, and the cannon bucked with a flash of smoke from the muzzle, releasing a ball the shape and size of a chicken egg.
But to Kiran’s horror, the bosdrake ducked, and the projectile struck a tree and exploded into a cloud of brown smoke. It was a concoction of chemicals with enough strength to knockout a fully-grown wildebeest.
“Oh no!” said Kiran as he punched the spent shell out of the side of the cannon. At the base of it was a cartridge that held four rounds, one of which he just wasted.
The bosdrake laughed mockingly as she got up and faced Kiran. The intensity of her glare caused him to flinch. “Amateur human!” she said. “You disguised your footsteps, but I smelt you coming a mile away. Hold your weapon!”
Kiran was about to point the weapon at her but he froze. That was when the bosdrake said, “Who are you? And what do you want with me?”
“M-My name is Kiran…” His voice was shaky, but nonetheless he bravely spoke. “I’m a sorcerer in training…and I’m looking for an ingredient for my next spell…”
“What kind of ingredient?” The bosdrake took four steps towards Kiran. The boy took four steps back. “Answer now you blasted human!”
Kiran swallowed a nervous lump. “…I need the queex of a bosdrake.”
The dragon gawked at Kiran. “What?” She was well aware of what “queex” was; the creamy vaginal fluid of any woman, possessing magical properties as a result of being influenced by their soul. “Oh, so you wanted to rape me, huh?”
“Wait! No!” said Kiran. “I was just going to knock you out and scrape out some of it!”
“Liar!” the bosdrake ran after Kiran, chasing him between the bushes and trees. Kiran attempted to point the cannon around him and fire, but his shot missed the bosdrake. She was running on all fours, and despite her slight chubbiness she was getting dangerously closer.
Kiran hurried clumsily down slope and served towards a path that lead out of the jungle. Just as Kiran found the grassy path, he felt the full weight of the bosdrake as she pounced upon him.
They rolled in a heap; Kiran trying to free himself from the bosdrake’s grasp while she tried to pin him down. Eventually her strength overpowered his, and she knelt over Kiran, smiling and bearing her sharp teeth.
“I’ve got you now, human,” she said.
“Please, let me go!” said Kiran.
“I’ll let you go…after I’ve bitten off that pretty nose of yours!” And the bosdrake opened her mouth wide enough that Kiran could see all forty of her teeth. 
He screamed and closed his eyes. “Doooooon’t!”
Kiran saw his whole life flash before his eyes, and as his body tensed in preparation for his end. But nothing came. 
Reluctantly, Kiran opened his eyes one by one, seeing the bosdrake looking at him impatiently. After he caught his breath, Kiran said, “You’re...not going to eat me?”
“No,” said the bosdrake, getting off the young man. “Human’s taste awful.” She walked over to the cannon on the ground and picked it up.
Kiran scurried to his feet. “…Why?”
The bosdrake abruptly smashed the cannon over her knee. Kiran yelp in disbelief. He ran over to the two piece and took them up. “My cannon!” He held the objects dejectedly in his hands. He looked at the beast. “You broke my cannon!”
“Would you have preferred If I broke your neck instead?” said the bosdrake staunchly.
Kiran imaged the horror of his vertebrae snapping like a twig, and suddenly looked at the pieces of his weapon as if they were nothing. “Awww blast…” He tossed the parts away. “Now I’ll never get the queex I want.”
The bosdrake, sensing no killing intent from the human, felt comfortable enough to ask, “What do you need my queex for?”
Kiran regarded her with a baffled stare. “I told, I need it for a spell?”
“You’re a wizard?” said the bosdrake.
“Uh…yes…yes I am…” The conversation felt too alien for the young boy. “Excuse me…miss bosdrake—”
“My name is Gatril,” said the reptile.
“Oh, okay,” said Kiran. Wow, am I really talking with a dragon? “Why are you asking about my profession all of a sudden…Gatril?”
The bosdrake suddenly sat on her bottom, partially opened her legs and gave Kiran a peak at her vagina. Gatril yawned and said, “I’m curious as to why you wanted to hunt me down, human. And you would do good to remember I spared your life out of courtesy, so it’s in your best interest to answer my questions.”
Kiran sighed. “Okay…fine…” His best chance of getting out of this alive was to just play along. But he was proud of himself. He was handling the situation better than he thought, for he had not soiled his pants yet. “The Witching Tournament is held three years in different countries. I’m trying to qualify for this year’s tournament, but I need special animal parts to perform my spells.”
“And that’s why you were going to capture me and rape me?” said Gatril.
“What? No!” Kiran waved his hands dismissively. “I wasn’t gonna rape you! That’s terrible! I’m still a virgin!”
“Then how did you plan on getting my queex?” said Gatril. “In order to get my queex you would’ve had to stimulate me so I can orgasm.”
Kiran nervously rubbed his hands together. “Well,” he looked at a stone on the ground, “I was planning to use my fingers.”
Gatril’s eyes lit up. “Really?” She noticed the key words in his statements, and painted a picture of the young man. “Do you live with your parents, boy? What’s your name?”
“My name is Kiran,” he said. “My father works at a carpeting company. My mother’s a farmer.”
Gatril sat forward, regarding Kiran with intense inhuman eyes that arouse more of his unease. “You sound like a well-off boy, Kiran?”
“Kinda,” he said. “How would you know about human jobs?”
Gatril chuckled. “Do you think you’re the first human I’ve met. For as long as I can remember humans have been coming in contact with beasts. Most hunt us down for our power. Only a very rare few treat us with compassion.”
Kiran hung his head, his eyes losing the willingness to look at Gatril. “I’m sorry,” he said. “This was my first-time hunting anything—anyone. I didn’t know what to do.”
Gatril slowly rose and approached Kiran. He didn’t run, not that he could out-speed her anyway. But he didn’t seem startled. Gatril looked him up and down quizzically. He seems firmly built, she thought. Well, he is a farm boy.
“So are you going to kill me now?” Kiran said.
Gatril shook her head. “No.” She ran her fingers across his cheek, feeling the warmth of his flesh. “I’ve decided I’m going to have some fun with you.”
Kiran arched his spine upon feeling a tingling sensation. “What kind of fun are you talking about?”
Gatril, wearing a fleshy smile, said, “I knew a human once. A man. He was, interesting. I want to see if you can take his place. Meet me here tomorrow at the same time. I’ll help you with your spells.”
“R-Really?” said Kiran, unable to hide his excitement. “I mean…you’re not afraid I’ll just runaway and never comeback?”
“Oh, you’ll return,” said Gatril. “A responsible sorcerer wouldn’t let an opportunity like this pass, would he?”
“No, I wouldn’t!” Kiran’s smile was big and toothy. “Oh wow! Thank you!”
“Stop kissing my ass and go home and get ready,” said Gatril, “we have a long day ahead of us tomorrow.”
Kiran hurriedly took up the parts of his cannon and clutched them under his arms. He gave Gatril one last glance before he hurried to the edge of the jungle.
As promised, Kiran returned the next day. The jungle itself was fifty acres, surrounded by the town on both sides with only a river at the north and south that connected it to distant jungles and forests within the country of Tatanui.
Kiran’s method of transport was a quacycle, a four-wheeled vehicle with a large seat and trolley at the back as the main centerpiece, held within a metal. It also had a large steam engine beneath it, with exhaust pipes jutting out the back.
It was sixty years ago since the world was plunged into the industrial revolution, and small engines like these were becoming widely marketed. Kiran just got his for his sixteenth birthday from his parents, albeit he had to put up some of the money from the odd jobs he was doing through the town; paperboy, yard sweeper, fruit picker and stable boy.
But it was having to put himself through such tasks that gave Kiran joy in his quacycle, and he scribbled his name all over the vehicle and decorated it with red paint and small banners of symbols of the arcane
Kiran stopped a few yards inside the jungle and switched a knob near the steering wheel, turning off the engine. He tied it to a tree with a lock and key and took his knapsack out of the cart. He had hastily repaired his cannon yesterday, only needing to weld the barrel back to the body. Now his focus was on accomplishing his first spell with Gatril’s help.
With giddiness Kiran jogged through the trees with his staff in hand and cannon and knapsack slung across his back. In the distance he spotted a small herd of deer grazing, when they suddenly popped their heads up and looked at him.
Expecting them to run away from the potential predator, one of the deer’s head snapped to the side, an arrow stuck in its eye. 
Kiran yelped and dove behind a tree. The deer fell and the others scattered out of sight. Kiran reached for his cannon in preparation for a potential conflict, when he saw the culprit who had fired the projectile in the skull of the herbivore.
They were diminutive, noisy, painted their pale skin on the chests and shoulders and wore clothing of simple loin clothes over their genitals. All these were the traits of a typical a batoiko. They were a group of people of only four feet in height, who also wore masks with hollow eyes and horrible expressions of tortured faces. They were made up of different tribes, seven of which lived within the country of Tatanui. 
They chattered around the dead deer with spears and knives in hand. One of them with a bow kicked the corpse of the animal. Met with no response, the male batoiko leaped onto the carcass and shouted in a garbled tongue. The other men and women shouted with the same synergy. 
Kiran doubted the excitement was due to this being their first kill, and rather their relish of the act. But he wasn’t going to stick around to see if they liked hunting people as well. He was well aware of the batoiko’s existence in the jungle, which was another reason why he brought along his weapon.
With a rehearsed pace the batoiko lifted the deer over the heads of four of them and hurried off out of sight. But one of them, a female by the proportions of the body and the small, bulging breasts, lingered behind.
Kiran folded behind the tree before she could look in his direction. The boy held his breath, and to how hard his heart was beating in his chest, wished he could silence it too before the batoiko heard him.
Seconds passed by, but Kiran didn’t dare look from around his hiding place. Then he heard the footsteps in the leaf litter plow away. When Kiran was certain he couldn’t hear the footsteps anymore, he cautiously peeped from behind the tree. 
And as Kiran walked from behind his cover, the batoiko fell from the tree upon him, dropping Kiran with a blow to his shoulder.
Kiran yelped and reflexively pulled the trigger. A round exploded against the base of a tree. Kiran rolled over and was greeted by the female’s crude looking mass and mane of hay around it. He screamed and brought the butt of his gun across the batoiko’s face, but the female pulled away.
She wrestled the weapon from Kiran with a startling strength and pulled a knife from the waist of her skirt. Excited, strange words rolled off her tongue as she lifted the blade.
“No!” Kiran crossed his arms over his head and clamped his eyes shut.
And Gatril leaped onto the batoiko like a lion, having been alerted to Kiran’s smell. The female failed to react in time as Gatril bit down on her shoulder, spun with her and tossed her aside.
The woman kicked up leaves as she rolled across the ground. She screamed choppy words and sprung onto her feet. She spotted what attacked her, and like a predator over its kill, Gatril stood on all fours over Kiran, her breasts dangling tantalizingly over his face.
Gatril made a snarl that shook the air around her, and having gotten the message, the batoiko woman squeaked and ran off.
“Little insects…” Gatril sneered.
Gatril looked down at the human and crawled off him. Kiran sprung up and reached for his cannon. “Th-Thank you!” he said, trying to catch his breath.
But Gatril’s face repelled his thanks with an irked frown. “You really are a clumsy weak human. This is the second time you almost got killed out here.”
Kiran dusted the leaves off him. “I’m sorry, Gatril! I’m not really a fighter like that.”
“Yes,” said Gatril, “a deer with apples on its feet is more like it.” Kiran frowned at her, but the dragon was unperturbed. “Just follow me.” And Gatril walked away.
Kiran trailed behind Gatril, mindful of her undulating tail and the possible other threats lying in wait for them. It wasn’t long before Gatril brought them upon her home. Kiran had been expecting from the stories his grandfather told him about dragons a tunnel leading to a massive cavern filled to the brim with treasures collected from around the world. 
This wasn’t the case.
The mass of branches bent and folded around four trees, covered by a layer of large leaves knitted together. The scene managed to spark both disappointment and intrigue in Kiran. “This is where you live?” he said.
“Yes,” said Gatril. “Wonderful, isn’t it?”
Kiran studied the finer details of the construction, noting that it resembled a dome somewhat, along with wooden posts that made up the frame. The inside had two straw beds, the second Gatril had prepared the previous night. Lighting was provided by holes in the walls, covered by large leaves. 
Gatril gestured to one of the beds. “Sit.”
“Umm…” Kiran carefully seated himself, looking across at the bosdrake on her own bed.
“So,” said Gatril, “Kiran, let me see what you’ve got.”
Kiran took out jars, scalpels, tiny prongs, his lunch and a book out of his bag and laid them on the floor. Beside the book, he put everything else aside, and opened the text. “This is a book of all spells that can be easily done with animal parts,” he said.
Gatril took the book and looked through the first five pages. She put it down and said, “But you know in order to do spells, you have to be able to use your spirit energy?”
Kiran replied with a sly grin. He opened his palm. His forehead furrowed with concentration, and he produced a faint white light in his hand. “I already learned it. My grandfather taught me.”
Gatril’s face puckered. She hadn’t been expecting this level of commitment from the boy. “That’s impressive,” she said. “Accessing one’s spiritual energy can’t be done by just anyone. You and your grandfather seem to have latent talent for it.”
“We do,” he said. “My father’s side comes from a long line of sorcerers and witches. My grandfather, when he was younger, he failed to slay a wyvern that was terrorizing a town. He was ashamed and forced himself into retirement. His name as a wizard wasn’t good anymore. That’s why his son, my father, took on carpeting as a profession. But I want to become a sorcerer just like we used to be.”  Kiran dispelled the light from him hand and relaxed. “So, like…how are we going to start this?” Kiran took out a smooth ovoid object and some water. “I’d brought these to…you know…” and Kiran made a thrusting motion with the object.
Gatril slapped the objects from Kiran’s hands. Kiran flinched, forming a pout as he stared at her. “Rubbish! Is that how you intend to get what you want?”
Kiran nervously rubbed his neck. “Well I don’t know how else.”
“You’ve never had sex before, you said?” Gatril said.
“Nope,” said Kiran. “Not with a human or a beast.”
“Hmm,” said Gatril. “I guess you’re not a sexplorer then.”
