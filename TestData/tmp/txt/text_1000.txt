All Kellan does is run his hand through his hair. “He's in a really bad way and he's losing a lot of blood. If we don't treat him soon it's gonna get worse.”
“I'll take him to my house, it's much closer than the hospital. My mom won't be there and I'll use her spare medical kit.”
I make my way towards the driver's side to see Max lying in the backseat with his head resting on Sam's lap.
As soon as I reach for the handle it's pulled back by Kellan's hand. 'I'll drive.”
“You've had a few drinks.”
“I have but now I'm sober. The alcohol wears off much quicker when you're a wolf.”
Well, that sucks.
The journey in the car was somewhat peaceful - no one spoke the whole time and in a way the silence was comfortable. I think all of us felt that silence was what we needed in that moment and as we arrived, the house cast in complete blackness was a welcoming feeling that I've longed for all day.
“You girls go inside and I'll bring him in.”
