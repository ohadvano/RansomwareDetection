I shake my head and roll my eyes when I see Mr. Edmund advancing in our direction. He unlocks the door and places himself in front of the whiteboard. He looks at each person individually as they come into the classroom, but stares coldly at the four who are last to enter the room.
“Don't take your seats yet everyone. We're going to have a little change in the classroom today because I feel that the people in the back are not concentrating as they should be.” He crosses his arms and looks towards the back.
“Right, can I have Kellan come sit next to Alice in the front here? Sam move to the next desk please,.” Kellan comes to sit next to me in the front. Our desk is in the middle with one desk on either side.
Kellan nudges me in greeting, I smile in response.
“Bane? Get your feet off the table now, I won't tell you again and come sit next to Sam please.”
Mr. Edmund stands in front of Sam's desk, waits for Bane to sit down and leans into his face. “I will not tolerate this kind of behaviour in my classroom, Bane. I can easily fail you at the end of the year seeing that every test you've done you've managed to fail. Congratulations, your parents must be so proud.”
Mr. Edmund leans down closer to him. “Don't give me a reason to kick you out of my class because mark my words Bane, I want you out. Failures are not welcomed in my classroom.”
Mr. Edmund may think that no one can hear him but there are four wolves in here that can clearly hear him. I can hear clearly but I'm sitting close by. The rest of the class would think that Mr. Edmund's just giving Bane a warning, but they don't know the real meaning of what's being said. What's gotten into him?
When I look over at Bane I see that his jaw is tensed firmly and his eyes look deadly. I look him over and see that his fist is clenched tightly under the desk; out of sight. I look more closely to see blood dripping from inside his palm - caused by his razor-sharp claws. I look up in panic hoping that Mr. Edmund hasn't noticed, but his attention has gone back to the classroom.
