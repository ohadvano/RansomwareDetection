The dragon gawked at Kiran. “What?” She was well aware of what “queex” was; the creamy vaginal fluid of any woman, possessing magical properties as a result of being influenced by their soul. “Oh, so you wanted to rape me, huh?”
“Wait! No!” said Kiran. “I was just going to knock you out and scrape out some of it!”
“Liar!” the bosdrake ran after Kiran, chasing him between the bushes and trees. Kiran attempted to point the cannon around him and fire, but his shot missed the bosdrake. She was running on all fours, and despite her slight chubbiness she was getting dangerously closer.
Kiran hurried clumsily down slope and served towards a path that lead out of the jungle. Just as Kiran found the grassy path, he felt the full weight of the bosdrake as she pounced upon him.
They rolled in a heap; Kiran trying to free himself from the bosdrake’s grasp while she tried to pin him down. Eventually her strength overpowered his, and she knelt over Kiran, smiling and bearing her sharp teeth.
“I’ve got you now, human,” she said.
“Please, let me go!” said Kiran.
“I’ll let you go…after I’ve bitten off that pretty nose of yours!” And the bosdrake opened her mouth wide enough that Kiran could see all forty of her teeth. 
He screamed and closed his eyes. “Doooooon’t!”
Kiran saw his whole life flash before his eyes, and as his body tensed in preparation for his end. But nothing came. 
Reluctantly, Kiran opened his eyes one by one, seeing the bosdrake looking at him impatiently. After he caught his breath, Kiran said, “You’re...not going to eat me?”
“No,” said the bosdrake, getting off the young man. “Human’s taste awful.” She walked over to the cannon on the ground and picked it up.
Kiran scurried to his feet. “…Why?”
The bosdrake abruptly smashed the cannon over her knee. Kiran yelp in disbelief. He ran over to the two piece and took them up. “My cannon!” He held the objects dejectedly in his hands. He looked at the beast. “You broke my cannon!”
“Would you have preferred If I broke your neck instead?” said the bosdrake staunchly.
Kiran imaged the horror of his vertebrae snapping like a twig, and suddenly looked at the pieces of his weapon as if they were nothing. “Awww blast…” He tossed the parts away. “Now I’ll never get the queex I want.”
The bosdrake, sensing no killing intent from the human, felt comfortable enough to ask, “What do you need my queex for?”
Kiran regarded her with a baffled stare. “I told, I need it for a spell?”
“You’re a wizard?” said the bosdrake.
“Uh…yes…yes I am…” The conversation felt too alien for the young boy. “Excuse me…miss bosdrake—”
“My name is Gatril,” said the reptile.
“Oh, okay,” said Kiran. Wow, am I really talking with a dragon? “Why are you asking about my profession all of a sudden…Gatril?”
The bosdrake suddenly sat on her bottom, partially opened her legs and gave Kiran a peak at her vagina. Gatril yawned and said, “I’m curious as to why you wanted to hunt me down, human. And you would do good to remember I spared your life out of courtesy, so it’s in your best interest to answer my questions.”
Kiran sighed. “Okay…fine…” His best chance of getting out of this alive was to just play along. But he was proud of himself. He was handling the situation better than he thought, for he had not soiled his pants yet. “The Witching Tournament is held three years in different countries. I’m trying to qualify for this year’s tournament, but I need special animal parts to perform my spells.”
“And that’s why you were going to capture me and rape me?” said Gatril.
“What? No!” Kiran waved his hands dismissively. “I wasn’t gonna rape you! That’s terrible! I’m still a virgin!”
“Then how did you plan on getting my queex?” said Gatril. “In order to get my queex you would’ve had to stimulate me so I can orgasm.”
Kiran nervously rubbed his hands together. “Well,” he looked at a stone on the ground, “I was planning to use my fingers.”
Gatril’s eyes lit up. “Really?” She noticed the key words in his statements, and painted a picture of the young man. “Do you live with your parents, boy? What’s your name?”
“My name is Kiran,” he said. “My father works at a carpeting company. My mother’s a farmer.”
Gatril sat forward, regarding Kiran with intense inhuman eyes that arouse more of his unease. “You sound like a well-off boy, Kiran?”
“Kinda,” he said. “How would you know about human jobs?”
Gatril chuckled. “Do you think you’re the first human I’ve met. For as long as I can remember humans have been coming in contact with beasts. Most hunt us down for our power. Only a very rare few treat us with compassion.”
Kiran hung his head, his eyes losing the willingness to look at Gatril. “I’m sorry,” he said. “This was my first-time hunting anything—anyone. I didn’t know what to do.”
Gatril slowly rose and approached Kiran. He didn’t run, not that he could out-speed her anyway. But he didn’t seem startled. Gatril looked him up and down quizzically. He seems firmly built, she thought. Well, he is a farm boy.
