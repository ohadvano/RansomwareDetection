Ryder takes the bowl of the fresh salad and dishes himself a bowl. “When they came into my pack they absolutely hated each other. Couldn't stand to be in the same room without one or the other starting a fight.”
“Why did they hate each other so much?”
He shrugs. “I can't say for sure but I think it had something to do with both of them being my Betas. You see, Silver thought that because we were sleeping together that she was entitled to being my second in command, but considering that Bane's saved my life more than once, he's gained that right for himself and he'll never give that up. I know that he comes off as rude and hot headed, but he's loyal and he's good at what he does.”
That I can believe.
“How did you make them stop fighting?”
“It was simple, I told Silver to get over it or she'll be kicked out from the pack.”
“Wow, I bet she took that well.” I say enthusiastically. After that, we finish eating our breakfast in comfortable silence. We don't talk about what might happen today or if something could go wrong, but I can only imagine the worst when it involves Max and Ryder.
After clearing the dirty dishes, I go up the stairs, into the bedroom and change into the sweats and t-shirt I wore yesterday. I don't think twice about how I look when I leave the house, and I find Ryder in a black sports car waiting for me. The moment I close the door and put my seatbelt on, we're on our way towards Max's house.
We arrive outside his house forty minutes later and throughout the whole journey, I kept asking myself if Ryder actually knew where Max lived. I know he's a wolf and all but can a wolf actually lead you to someone's house?
