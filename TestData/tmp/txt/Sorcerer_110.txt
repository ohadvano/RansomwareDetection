The young woman snatched her ID from the officer and followed Kiran back into town. They decided to take a walk along one of the factories to explore how far the advancements in technology in the country had gone. 
The facility was surrounded by a large fence of wooden posts, and through the large open door, the two could see trolleys and small carts carrying hunks of metal to and from the back.
Kiran looked up at the sign which read “Okoyo’s Engine Repair Service”. “Do you think they made a spell that can combine magic and machines?” said Kiran.
“Not to my knowledge,” said Aparna. “I don’t think that would even be allowed in the tournament either.”
“Would’ve been cool though,” Kiran said. “I know you have knights who are good at using gadgets.”
“Gadgets malfunction, spells don’t,” Aparna snapped. “Let’s go already. I still need to get the tingle of that policeman off me.”
Kiran shrugged and continued with Aparna back to the inn. While Kiran studied his book of spells once more, Aparna was just about finished with her knew spell, having gathered the ingredients to mix with the zebra semen and turn into an orb. She had a large bracelet with three sockets, one of which she fitted the orb into. Aparna channeled her spirit energy into the stone and locked the bracelet around her foot.
“Okay, all done,” said Aparna.
Kiran closed the book and sat up. “Okay. Let’s go see what Gatril’s up to.”
The two took his quacycle and rode out of the town. On the outskirts they made their way to the set of trees Gatril had indicated to them, only to find a giant, round mass of branches bent and woven into a nest.
“What in the world is that?” said Aparna.
“Don’t worry,” said Kiran as he parked his vehicle outside from the structure. “I think she just made a house.”
They got off and walked towards the nest, though Aparna kept a cautious distance behind Kiran. The boy turned on a new lantern he bought and carefully brought its light close to the entrance of the nest. “Gatril…?”
“What?” The voice came from behind them, and both humans spun around hysterically to see Gatril falling from the tree.
“G-Gatril!” Kiran said. “Don’t scare us like that!”
“That wasn’t nice, dragon,” said Aparna, her hand on the grip of her gun. “I could’ve shot you.”
“If you did, I would’ve bitten your head off.” And Gatril smiled, displaying her formidable teeth.
Kiran quickly went between them and said, “Hey, you two knock it off. We just came here to see how you are Gatril.”
“Check this out Kiran,” said Gatril. She turned away from everyone, inhaled briefly, and exhaled from her throat a stream of cloudy, green substance in the air. Kiran and Aparna got a whiff of it and immediately felt their heads going fuzzy and their knees buckling.
“Gyaaah!” Kiran covered his nose and hurried out of the mist. He fell on his knees. “G-Gatril, what is this stuff?”
Aparna fell on her bottom, wrapping her mouth and nose with her cloak. 
Gatril was all smiles despite the unhealthy predicament of her comrades. “You guys like it? It’s a special plant I ate. Bosdrakes have the ability to regurgitate specific chemicals in the food we eat.”
As the green fog disappeared, Kiran and Aparna rose to their feet, taking deep breaths so their lungs could recover. 
“You could’ve at least given us a warning,” said Aparna.
“That would’ve spoiled the surprise,” said Gatril. “Kiran, did you bring any food?”
“…Yeah,” he said. He handed her the basket. 
Gatril took it and flung the top open. “Hmmm, pork,” she said, the fragrance immediately watering her mouth. 
“We better leave fun time for tomorrow night,” said Kiran. “We’ll need all our strength against the popobawa. I’ll sleep out here with you tonight just to make sure we’re safe.”
“I told you already, I don’t need your company,” said Gatril.
“It’s not up for discussion.” Kiran crept into the nest and carefully placed the lantern in the center of the floor of matted leaves. He put his knapsack in the corner along with Gatril’s small items.
“Excuse me,” said Aparna. “What do you two mean by, funtime?”
Gatril swallowed the piece of meat in her mouth and said, “Sex.”
“…I see,” said Aparna. “You two seem to have quiet the relationship.”
“We’re just friends with benefits,” said Gatril.
Aparna made a lopsided grin. “He’s a really good friend to be staying out here around predators with a dragon.”
