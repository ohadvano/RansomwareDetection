I open my eyes and take off my shirt swiftly, and look over my shoulder to look at the bite.
“What the hell...?”
I look in the mirror to see nothing but pure smooth skin, “Where is it...?”
Not a single bite mark was to be seen.
I didn't understand. It happened just hours ago and yet it's gone?
After changing into my uniform, I walk out of the bathroom and place myself behind the counter, but I couldn't concentrate on doing anything. Questions kept interrupting my thoughts, but I couldn't answer either of them. Maybe it healed overnight?
I peel my shirt over my right shoulder and check again. Nothing.
“Christ, Alice, you trying to give these people a strip tease or something?”
I roll my eyes when I hear her voice. I look towards the front of the diner to see Sam walking towards me with her school bag draped over her shoulder. She takes out her laptop and today's homework, and sits directly in front of me on our new red diner stools.
