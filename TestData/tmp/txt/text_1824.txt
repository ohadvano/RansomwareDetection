Ryder leans down closer to me. “I do because I want him to stay as far away from you as possible.”
I shove his chest but I always seem to forget that his body is as hard as steel. “How can you say that!? You have no right to speak to me like that after what I saw you doing.”
He waves me off. “Silver's meaningless, and I have needs just like any other wolf does. Besides, it's not like I need to give you an explanation on who I'm being intimate with.”
“There'd be too many to count if I did ask you anyway.” I taunt.
It's silent for a few seconds then I take a deep breath. “I don't care that you've slept with Silver in the past because that's between you and her. I don't know why I came up here, but I know for one thing that I didn't like what I saw out there. For a second, I thought for sure Max was dead. Now there's something bigger going on in this town, and you're taking it out on some guy that has no idea about it. This shit with Max ends right now because when the next month is here we're gonna have another dead body. That's what we should be focusing on.”
My heart is beating by the time I finish talking, but I also feel relieved that I spoke freely about how I felt. I can't believe that a part of me feared about speaking my mind to someone like Ryder, but somehow I feel like I'm getting through to him slowly.
“I'm not promising anything Alice because if he gets in my way one more time, I'll do more than just throw in a couple of punches. He's up to something, and I'm gonna find out what it is. You need to open your eyes and see what kind of person he actually is before it's too late.”
It's my turn to shake my head. “You're wrong about him, but you're not gonna change the way you feel about him so it looks like I'm done here.”
I turn to walk away but stop when I hear my name coming from Ryder.
