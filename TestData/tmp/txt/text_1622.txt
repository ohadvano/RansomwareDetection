After a few minutes, I feel his movements starting to become more rigid, and after pushing inside me one last time, he moans and breathes heavily.
There was no feeling of regret after what I had done. Once our breathing slowed down, Ryder left for the bathroom, came back and placed me into his bed where we spent the whole night holding each other. That feeling of connecting with someone is indescribable and for that person being Ryder, made the whole experience better than I could have ever imagined.
If somebody asked me when I was most happy, I wouldn't hesitate to say that tonight was by far the happiest I've ever been, and it's all thanks to Ryder King.
Chapter 22

The next morning, Ryder drives us all to school but stops on the way to my house to pick up some essentials that I need for school, and spare clothes that I'll wear for the next few days. I also check to see if my mother arrived home safely from work, and felt relieved when I saw her sleeping peacefully in her bed.
On the way to school, nobody said a word and it made the atmosphere in the car almost unbearable, I wonder if it could've been for a number of reasons. The first option that crosses my mind is the death of Terry on Saturday, but it wouldn't make sense considering I was the only person close to him, but could it perhaps be that his body was found on their property and it makes them somehow feel responsible? The second option is obviously the harsh words exchanged between Silver and Ryder last night.
Could situations like that really cause this much of an awkward situation between them? And lastly, could the reason be why no one's talking because they somehow know that I spent the night with Ryder?
They couldn't possibly know, could they?
