“Do you think humans are the only ones who like adventure?” said Gatril. “You presume beasts like to live in trees, caves and huts. We like material things as well, you know.”
“Okay,” said Kiran. “I can understand that. So, I’ve agreed to all your demands.” Kiran looked over Gatril and raised his hand halfway. “Do we shake on it or…”
Gatril presented the tip of her tail to Kiran. “Kiss it.”
“What?” he said.
“Kiss it,” she replied. “It will be proof of our allegiance.”
Kiran sighed. “You know, I think you’re getting back at me for trying to capture you.”
“Yes, actually,” Gatril retorted.
Kiran shrugged, and kissed her tail.

CHAPTER TWO

Kiran took three days to prepare for his journey, gathering clothes, food, weapons and the items necessary for crafting his spells. His home was situated in a large town of cottages composed of wood and concrete, broken up my many paved streets with those being bare earth in the communities.
Kiran pushed his quacycle through his front yard and out the gate. Just as he turned to close it, he saw his mother and father walking out of the house. His father had on leathery overall made from the skin of a buffalo, stained with grease and other unknown substances. His mother wore a simple blue frock and beneath her messy apron. 
“When will you be coming back?” his mother said, her round face looking perturbed.
“In about two weeks,” Kiran said. “I’ll need to register for the tournament soon.”
“So long?” she retorted. “Your allowance won’t last all that time, you know.”
“Don’t worry,” Kiran said, “I can find some jobs around the villages if I need to.”
“Do you have your ID Kiran?” his father said.
“I do, dad.” Kiran took it out of his pocket and held it up for them to see. It was a pass-card was a translucent piece of material with one’s name, address and their fingerprint. 
“Good,” the man said. “Be sure to stay out of trouble.”
“Yessir,” Kiran said.
His mother waved at him. “Be careful dear! And good luck!”
Kiran waved back and hopped onto his vehicle, pedaling off down the road. Passing through his community he saw the brothel where visitors to the town frequented, as well as bars and various workshops. The hospital along with the police department and the village headman’s office was in the town square, but Kiran took his journey closer to the eastern outskirts of the village where the jungle was.
Reaching the lonely path again, Karin turned into the forest. Yet, he didn’t need to go far, as Gatril was there waiting on him, sitting wearing a loincloth over her privates and a bra of matted leaves. She had a small pouch tied around her waist as well, and munched on a handful on fruits.
Kiran parked his vehicle and approached her. “I see you’re all set.”
Gatril swallowed and said, “Hmph. You brought a lot of stuff with you. I hope you have food.”
“I do,” he said. “You sure do eat a lot.
“Bosdrakes don’t like going anywhere on an empty stomach,” said Gatril. “And we expend a lot of energy during fights.”
Kiran shrugged lightly. “Okay. So, our first mission is finding a lamia!”
Gatril swallowed her last bit of food and said, “Those are a bit bigger than I am.”
Kiran took a book from out of his backpack and flipping through the pages. “I know. I have a bestiary.” Kiran held the book up so she could see. Gatril saw the image of a coiled serpent with arms, legs and a human-like head and neck. Beneath it were some notes about the creature, it’s diet and habitat.
Gatril made a thoughtful hum. “These books aren’t always accurate. Sometimes the monsters’ behavior may change along with their environment.”
“Well that’s what you’re here to help with.” Kiran put away the book. “Anyways, we should get started.”
Kiran hopped onto his quacycle and gestured to a space behind him. Gatril carefully climbed on and held onto Kiran’s waist. “I’ve never rode one of these things before.”
“Don’t worry,” Kiran said. “I’m an expert.”
