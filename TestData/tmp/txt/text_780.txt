Ryder moves to stand in front of me with his arms crossed over his chest. “You are going to talk because we came here for a reason, and we're not gonna leave until you give us what we need.”
Max rolls his eyes. “And what is it that you need from me?”
“Answers.” I take another step towards him.
“What answers could you possibly want from me?” He glares intensely at both of us.
“Well first, how about you tell us asshole	”
I stop Ryder. “Ryder, please.” I give him a look to indicate that I'll do the talking. I can't risk him pissing off Max before we get any answers.
I clear my throat and begin my interrogation. “Do you remember that day, out by the football field when I saw you on crutches?”
“Of course I remember. It's kinda hard to forget being in a fight that happened on my first day of school.” He stares at Ryder.
Ryder's posture goes rigid as he stares directly back at Max. “What the fuck are you looking at?”
