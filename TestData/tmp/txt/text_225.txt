I stare at his back with imaginable lasers - wishing it was the real thing. “Whatever.”
I pour myself some apple juice and butter a piece of toast when I hear someone coming down the stairs. The footfalls are too heavy to be Silver's and Kellan's probably at home with his dad, so when Ryder comes into view it's really hard for me to take my eyes away from him.
Oh, Lord.
He comes into the kitchen while running his hand through his freshly showered hair, wearing a tight white wife- beater that showcases his perfectly sculpted body, black jeans with his feet bare. He smiles, sits directly in front of me and pours some cranberry juice for himself. Neither of us breaks the staring contest we seem to have, but it breaks just as Silver comes barging into the kitchen over to where Bane stands.
“I'll have some of that bacon, Bane.” Silver inhales the bacon one last time before taking the seat next to Ryder.
Bane scowls from behind her. “You thought this was for you?” Bane scoffs as he holds up the bacon sandwich that immediately causes my mouth to water. “I ain't no one's bitch Silver, especially not yours.” He takes a bite of the sandwich, and walks out of the kitchen followed by a now annoyed Silver.
Ryder shakes his head. “I swear those two will be the death of me.”
“Are they that bad?” I take another sip of the apple juice.
Ryder takes the bowl of the fresh salad and dishes himself a bowl. “When they came into my pack they absolutely hated each other. Couldn't stand to be in the same room without one or the other starting a fight.”
