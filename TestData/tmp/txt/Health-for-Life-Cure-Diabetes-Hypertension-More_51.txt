
There is a higher rate of cancer of the prostate among blacks â€” two times that of

Caucasians and four times that of Asians. Medical researchers and social scientists have

postulated that their often higher incidence of sexual activity may have led to this increase

in prostate problems. Male hormones increase with sexual excitation. The male hormone

testosterone breaks down to dihydrotestosterone. It is known that this substance, at least

in some laboratory animals, can cause the prostate to enlarge. The male hormones seem

to be a major cause of prostate enlargement as prostate enlargement rarely occurs

among eunuchs.

Enlargement of the prostate can be detected during a rectal examination (in which

the physician inserts a gloved finger into the rectum). If the doctor's examining finger

discovers a hard, button-size nodule in the otherwise soft, rubbery tissue, he considers it

cancer until he has proved otherwise. (Three times out of five, it is cancer).

Symptoms of an enlarged prostate usual y develop gradual y, as the enlarging

prostate compresses and distorts the urethra, (urinary tube). The flow of urine is

constricted, and there is difficulty starting urination and a weak stream. If the prostate

becomes too enlarged it wil actual y close off the urinary tube completely. In extreme

cases the prostate can become as large as a grapefruit. This enlargement can be either

cancerous or benign, but is usual y cancerous.

Cancer of the prostate is the second most common cancer in men. It sometimes

develops in middle age, but most often occurs in the elderly. Most cancers of the prostate

are very slow growing and usual y the person wil die of some other disease such as heart



162

attack, stroke, diabetes, etc., before they would die of prostate cancer. Recent studies

suggest that if every case of prostate cancer were treated in its earliest stages, more men

would die of surgical complications than the disease itself.



DIET ATTECTS THE PROSTATE

It is of interest that diet is not usual y mentioned as a cause of cancer of the

prostate. Yet it is cited as very important in a 20 year study done by Dr. Roland Phil ips at

Loma Linda, California. The study showed that fatal prostate cancer was more common

depending on the frequency with which meat, milk, eggs and cheese were used in the

diet. As each one of these food substances was added to the diet, the risk increased.

(Journal of Epidemiology 120(2):244) Cancer of the prostate is substantial y less among

Seventh-Day Adventists who use no coffee, alcohol and little or no animal products.

(Cancer Research, 43:2403, May 1983) Persons with any kind of prostate problems must

make sure they are drinking plenty of water so that the urine is almost clear. They should

also be on a diet of mostly raw foods.



FOOD THAT IRRITATE THE PROSTATE

Alcohol, animal products, caffeine, and spices should be eliminated from the diet of

those who have prostate problems. Animal products should be removed from the diet

because of the purine content which tends to increase the irritability of the bladder which

can indirectly affect the prostate gland. Caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, colas and

chocolate is an irritant to the urinary tract. It has been shown that just one cup of coffee

per day can cause 2 1/2 times greater incidence of cancer of the bladder. Spices also

have a tendency to irritate the prostate and bladder and should be removed from the diet.



NUTRITIONAL TREATMENT VS. CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT

The primary conventional treatments administered for enlarged prostate are

catheter drainage, estrogenic hormones, prostatic massage, and of course, closed

transurethral prostatic resection or, alternatively, removal of the prostate. Unfortunately,

doctors (and patients) have found surgery to be a radical remedy to this*" common

affliction, often resulting in complications. More and more patients are opting for a safer

cure.

Because of its nontraumatic, natural way the nutritional approach is preferable to

the more orthodox procedures.



For Prostate Enlargement Use Saw Palmetto Berries and Zinc



Enlarged prostate responds wel to the herb saw palmetto berries. Saw Palmetto is

a smal palm tree native to the West Indies and the Atlantic Coast of North America

extending from North Carolina to Florida. The trees are crowned with large, two to four-

foot high spiny-toothed leaves which form a circular, fan-shaped outline.

The plant's deep red-brown to black berries are wrinkled, oblong, and 0.5 to 1 - inch

in length with a diameter of 0.5 inch. They contain about 1.5 percent of a fruity smel ing oil

loaded with the sterol betasitosterol and its glu-coside, plus the saturated and unsaturated

fatty acids of captric, caprylic, caproic, lauric, palmitic, and ol eic. These fatty acids

comprise 63% of the oil, with the remaining portion consisting of their ethyl esters and the

mentioned sterols. Also present are carotenes, lipase, tannins and sugars.

Serenoa Repens (Saw Palmetto berries) has been found to be extremely effective

in treating prostate enlargement, according to a study by Dr. G. Champault published in

the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. Serenoa works by countering the effect of



163

decreased testosterone in your system, (which al ows other hormones, including DHT, to

increase the size of the prostate.) Dr. C. Sultan, in a study published in the Journal of

Steroid Biochemistry, found that Serenoa contains sterol like compounds that inhibit the

formation of DHT. This nutrient comes from a berry produced by a palm species common

to the Southeast United States. American Indians felt it was a cure for prostate problems.

European scientists have confirmed these effects in 12 major scientific studies done over

the past twenty years.

Prostate disorders are much more common in developed countries, such as the

United States, than in Third World countries. There are a few reasons why. The primary

one is that the majority of American meals are overcooked or over processed. The

processing of food destroys a good portion, if not al , of one of the most important

nutrients used by the prostate gland - zinc.



The Prostate Needs 10 Times More Zinc Than Any Other Organ



Most of the zinc in food is lost in processing, or never exists in a substantial amount

due to nutrient poor soil. Zinc is not normal y replaced in the soil when chemical fertilizers

are used. The world famous founder of the free radical theory of aging, Dr. Denham

Harman, M.D., Ph.D. professor emeritus of the University of Nebraska School of Medicine,

stated, "Some 90% of the population consumes diets deficient in zinc."

The prostate uses 10 times more of this nutrient than any other organ in the body.

As the production of testosterone declines, an enzyme stimulates the production of DHT

and other hormones which cause enlargement. Many scientists have confirmed that when

sufficient zinc is present, it helps prevent that enzyme from doing its damage.



Dr. M. S. Fahin and Dr. H. A. Essa published a clinical study in a government

medical journal showing that treatment with zinc reduces prostate enlargement. Dr.

Geoffrey Crisholin and Dr. Alan Leake reported in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry that

zinc prevents the hormonal actions that causes prostate enlargement. In total, fifteen

prominent research scientists published confirming reports that sufficient zinc is of vital

necessity for having a healthy prostate gland. Significant quantities of zinc are found in

brewerâ€™s yeast, lima beans, pecans, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and soybeans.

Smal er amounts of zinc are found in legumes and whole grains.



Hydrotherapy and Massage Will Help Reduce the Enlarged Prostate Gland



Hot and cold sitz baths alternating, using 3 minutes hot and one minute cold, are

beneficial for an enlarged prostate gland. You always start with the hot and end with the

cold. This combination can be done from 3 to 5 times, and should be done once or twice a

day. Massage of the prostate (through the rectum) can help reduce the swel ing and help

in the recovery of an enlarged prostate.

Prostate problems very rarely occur before the age of 30. At the age of 50 there wil

be a 25 percent chance of an enlarged prostate. At the age of 60 about half of al men wil

have developed some enlargement of the prostate. At the age of 80 almost al men wil

have some enlargement.



PROSTATE CANCER FACTS



Despite a major hoopla over the new Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test,

concurrent biopsies and early aggressive treatment for prostate cancer, the best treatment

for most men is no treatment at all. Here are the facts:



164



â€¢ Most cases of cancer of the prostate are so slow growing that they rarely become

life threatening.

â€¢ For men who are under 70, early detection and radical treatment may increase life

by less than one year, but complications are too severe to warrant prostatectomy

(removal of the prostate).

â€¢ Approximately one in 380 men with prostate cancer wil die of the disease.

â€¢ In a major study from Sweden, men of median age 72 were fol owed over ten

years. Al had prostate cancer. After ten years, the cancer death rate was 8.5% for

those men who received no treatment. The cancer death rate for American men

who are treated aggressively (PSA testing, drugs and prostatectomy) is 15%.

â€¢ The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute have long

advocated yearly rectal exams for men over 40. This screening is now being

escalated to recommendation for PSA blood test for men over 50. Both these tests

are absolutely meaningless, given the new results of testing. There is no reason for

early prostate cancer when the optimum treatment is no treatment at al .

â€¢ The PSA test is a poor test. More than one-third of al men with prostate cancer wil
