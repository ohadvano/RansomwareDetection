I grab the medical kit from under the sink and place it on the dining table. “You know, it's not your fault.”
“What's not my fault?” Sam crosses her arms over her chest.
“The situation with Bane. He's like that with everyone, and he won't change.”
She looks at me in disdain. “This isn't just about Bane. This is about how our friend almost got killed by a shapeshifter tonight, and to make things worse he doesn't even know that! Why are we associating ourselves with people like Ryder!? Before you got bitten, they didn't even know that we existed, and now they can't seem to stop following us. I'm going to be honest with you and say that I hate the fact that we now know about Mr. Daniels, and with what's going on in this town because I'm scared about what could be out there, whether it be something of the supernatural or not. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder in fear that something is coming after me.”
“Sam..”
Before I can respond to her, Kellan chooses that moment to bring in a bloodied Max into the house. I immediately guide him towards the dining table where he gently lays Max down on the table. I quickly wash my hands to avoid catching any kind of infection from the wounds Ryder inflicted on Max and rush back to the table.
“Do you need my help?” Kellan asks me just as I gently put pressure on the wounds with a sterile clean cloth to stop the bleeding.
“Thanks but I'm sure I can do it by myself being a nurse's daughter and all.”
I rush to one of the overhead cupboards and grab a bowl to fill up with water.
