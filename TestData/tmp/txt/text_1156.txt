Ryder clears his throat. “There's been a few murders in this town that have been kept on the down low. Major signs of animal attacks. We don't know who's responsible for the murders or why they're killing these people, but the number of bodies are piling up and the murderer knows how to cover its tracks. The four of us have tried finding a scent at every crime scene, but we never catch the scent.”
“Are you positive the attacks are caused by a wolf?” Sam asks.
“Of course we are you gormless prat!” Silver spits, “Kellan's father's a cop and he tells everything to his son. All murders are the same, bodies ripped to shreds. What kind of animal can do that? A wolf, and so far it's been five bodies. Mr Daniels was the fifth victim. We're recognizing a pattern so it's not just some random killing spree.”
“What's the pattern?” I ask quietly.
“One body every month.” Bane murmurs. “There's no way in hell we're gonna catch this fucker.”
A man of few words.
“Look if it helps either of you, I could describe to you what the wolf looked like.”
“It won't matter.” Ryder sighs. “You see, when you change for the first time, you're introduced to new abilities. Strength, Sound and Scent.” He turns to face the whole room. “Wolves can hide their scent after a long period of time, but only highly experienced wolves can do it. Whoever bit you can do exactly that. When I passed you in the hall, I could smell the venom in your body, but no scent of the wolf that bit you. The scent disappears if you fight the change, and you did. See, if you would've let your body change, you would have been able to identify that bond an Alpha does with its Beta. The chances of you finding that bond now is zero.”
“Ryder I was only trying to help.”
