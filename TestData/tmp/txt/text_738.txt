“Mum?”
“Yes, honey.” She faces me with a tired look in her eyes but she still smiles.
“Do you know a woman who works at the hospital that has the surname Fields?”
She thinks for a few minutes while murmuring the surname to herself over and over again, then she shakes her head. “No.”
“Are you sure?”
She thinks for a little while then nods. “I'm absolutely positive. We have no one working at the hospital with that surname. I'm the person that's in charge of arranging the shifts, and I've never come across that name.”
My heart has already stopped beating as my mother confidently tells me that Max's mother does not work at the place like he said. I knew something was wrong the minute I saw him in that hospital chair and called his name to see an expression that looked a lot like he didn't want to be caught.
And now that I know the truth I can't help but think why he was there in the first place?
“Is there a reason for this, Alice?”
