Ryder stands unmoving in the middle of my room - his clothes soaked from the wet weather outside. He wears black skinny jeans with a white shirt sticking to him that makes out his bare muscular chest underneath. His hair is slicked back with droplets of rain falling every so often on his face, and he also breathes heavily like he's been running to get here.
I'm frozen from the position in my bed wondering what has brought Ryder here in the middle of the night.
“Ryder, what are you doing?”
“Is it true?” Ryder asks in a gravelly voice which in return makes my heart skip a beat.
It takes me a couple of seconds for me to answer him. “Is what true?”
Ryder crosses his arms over his chest, causing the muscles of his biceps to bulge through the sleeves. “What Kellan said to me.”
I shake my head. “It was no big deal. Max kissed me and...”
“That's not what I meant.” “Oh.”
“I was told that you don't feel as though you're a wolf.”
