
individual comes down with a fever, their body is trying to tel

them something is wrong.



Fever happens to be a defense strategy employed by

the body that helps to destroy bacteria and viruses that have

gotten out of hand. Bacteria and viral microbes live normal y

and natural y inside of human beings. They co-exist with us,

around us and inside us, and when our body's immune

system is working properly, these microbes cause us little

concern. In fact, many scientists have demonstrated that

these microbes are often important to our inner functioning

and biochemical existence. Our body's own innate ability to

keep bacteria and viruses in check inside of us via our immune system is the best way to

stay wel . Our bodies contain over seventy thousand tril ion cel s that al make their own

chemicals. They make them in the right quantities and there are no il side effects. When a

person does get a fever it is the body's natural way of destroying bacteria and viruses.

These bacteria and viruses find it extremely difficult to sustain their existence in higher

temperature ranges, and so the body's immune system causes the fever to kil off the

microbes.



Thus, when our body has a fever, it is not good to lower the fever as this wil hinder

the body from doing its job of getting rid of the problems causing the fever.

What we need to do is help our body by raising our temperature. Many years ago

when someone had a fever, they would put them to bee cover them up with lots of

blankets, and eve put hot water bottles on their feet. They would also give the individual

large amounts of put soft water to drink. After a time the fever would break and the person

was on their way to recovery.



ISN'T TOO HIGH A FEVER DANGEROUS?



Conventional medicine spends most of its time treating symptoms or signs of

disease instead of treating the disease. For example, when one has a fever and goes to

the doctor h is given medication, such as aspirin, to lower the fever. By lowering the fever

by chemical y introducing a drug, the medical profession is not treating the disease but

instead only addressing the symptom. Medicine as a profession ha taught us that it is

beneficial to lower the fever whereas, in reality, this wil cause harm to the body. By

lowering the fever artificial y this prevents the immune system from doing the job is

supposed to do, thus the person gets sicker 2 the microbes increase.



As long as the temperature is below 105Â° F, it wil not cause harm or brain damage

to normal person. When I worked at a hospital in Central America we had patients come in

with malaria who had high temperatures and it didnâ€™t cause brain damage.

IS THERE A NATURAL WAY TO LOWER A FEVER?

If a person's temperature goes over 105Â° make sure they are drinking plenty of

water. If they are drinking the water and their temperature is stil over 105Â° F. then the best

way to lower the fever is by putting them into a ful bath tub of water that is around 98Â° -

100Â° F. Never put them into ice water or cold water. This wil cause most of the blood from

the legs and arms to go to the trunk of the body and wil hinder circulation and be

detrimental.



WHAT ELSE SHOULD BE DONE FOR A HIGH FEVER?

As long as the fever is below 105Â° F. let it take its course. Give plenty of water as

mentioned earlier. If they want to eat give them only fresh fruit. Make sure they are

comfortable and in quiet surroundings. Be sure they have plenty of fresh air and sunshine,

and that they bathe everyday. Most fevers are of a rather short duration, but occasional y

they can last for a longer period of time. The human body is the greatest doctor alive.

When one has a fever, help the fever to do its job natural y.

FOODS - ACID AND ALKALINE





Al food, as they are digested or burned, leave an ash in the body. This ash can be

neutral, acid or alkaline, depending on the mineral composition of the food. The acid ash

(acidosis) results when there is a depletion of the alkaline ash. In the healing of sickness,

the higher the ratio of alkaline forming foods in the diet, the faster wil be the recovery.

Alkalis neutralize the acids. Al the minerals that make up the red blood cel s and the blood

plasma are alkaline, except for chlorine which is acid. There are other important fluids in

the body which are alkaline. Some of these are saliva, bile, tears, lymph, joint lubricant,

muscle lubricant, colon secretion and pancreatic juice. None of the alkaline juices are

body wastes, though the bile contains waste. Some body fluids that are acidic are urine,

perspiration, fluid emitted during expiration, fatigue wastes and gastric juice. Al of these

fluids are body wastes except for the gastric juice, which is used for digestion. It is

important to realize that the body fluids which contribute to the life processes are al

alkaline except the gastric juice and that the waste fluids are al acid. The acid products

must be eliminated because the healthy state of the body is one of alkalinity. If the tissues

of the body become acid to the slightest degree, serious il ness occurs and death can

result.

The degree of acidity or alkalinity of a substance is expressed in pH values, the "p"

indicates the potency, while the "H" is for hydrogen ions which is the name the chemist

gives to the particular element constituting the acid. The scale ranges from 0 (acid) to 14

(alkaline), with 7 being neutral, neither acid nor alkaline.

Normal blood is slightly alkaline, just above neutral, having a pH of 7.35. If the pH

of a person's blood reaches higher than 7.8 or fal s below 7.22, immediate death occurs. A

condition known as acidosis occurs when the pH of the blood drops below 7.35. If the

blood rises above the normal 7.35, alkalosis exists and grows more severe, until death

occurs when the pH reaches 7.8. This provides a variable range of only about .6 of a

degree. Disease occurs any time the blood does not have a normal pH of 7.35.

The more acid the fluids and tissues of the body become the more subject they are

to the growth of bacteria and germs, and the less able they are to combat them. It is now

known that acid-forming foods increase the excretion of calcium and phosphorus from the

body (causing osteoporosis) and that alkaline-forming foods tend toward a greater

retention of these mineral salts in the body. Kidney stones are sometimes concentrations

of uric acid crystals which are more apt to form when the urine is too acidic. A more

alkaline urine tends to dissolve them. A burning sensation can develop when the urine

becomes very acidic. By drinking large amounts of distil ed water one can speed the

process of acid elimination through the pores and kidneys. The pH of urine can be

changed in just a few hours.

The skin is provided with approximately 1,500,000 sweat glands, excreting

perspiration, which is acidic. The lungs give off carbonic acid gas which is released as

carbon dioxide and water. The burning of food and oxygen in the body cel s produces this

gas which is taken by lymph and blood to the lungs to be exhaled.

More processes of life are aided by alkaline fluids than acid. Both are necessary.

Alkalis are continual y being consumed and the supply depleted. Since they are

continual y being consumed, there is the danger that the supply wil be exhausted. It is

very plain then, that if foods wil influence the alkalinity and acidity of the body we need to

eat abundantly of that which wil keep the alkalinity of the body high, and eat sparingly of

foods which wil increase its acidity. The ideal ratio according to Dr. Roger Berg, the

world's foremost authority on the relationship between the acid-alkaline ratio in the diet, is

about 80% alkaline producing foods and 20% acid producing foods. The correct pH

balance of our blood can be maintained by choosing careful y the foods one eats. Another

factor, which influences the correct balance, is the ability of the kidneys, skin pores and

lungs to eliminate acids. It is important that these organs function properly.

Harmful acids that we should avoid are: acetic acid found in vinegar; tannic acid

found in coffee, tea and cocoa; and benzoic acid found in food preservatives. Foods that

are acid in themselves such as citrus, when digested and assimilated by the body leave

an alkaline residue, while alkaline foods leave an acid residue. Therefore, we refer to the

foods as either acid forming, or alkaline forming.

Studies have also confirmed that rest, exercise, fresh air, laughter and love are

alkalizers of the body; selfishness, anger, worry and hatred are acidifiers of the body.
