Kiran remembered his words clearly, and decided this wasn’t worth walking back on his resolve. “Alright. I’ll do it.”
“Good,” said Scalian. “Follow me to my burrow.”
The lamia slithered off into the vegetation. The human and bosdrake followed behind, careful not to trip over her elongated body. Scalian eventually got on all fours and crawled into a hole in the ground big enough for a cow to fit through.
Kiran and Gatril crawled through the dark, cool tunnel, with Kiran’s small lantern as their guiding light. The path eventually ended in a vast circular space, which despite Scalian’s size, was big enough that she only occupied one third of it.
Upon entering into the serpent’s chambers, Gatril began to strip. “We better get started.”
Kiran took off his clothes under the watch of Scalian. She was able to contorts her body so that her lower half with her legs, vagina and anus rested before her. Kiran handed her a jar, instructing her to pour her fluids inside it when the time came.
Gatril took Kiran’s hands, bouncing on her feet and jiggling her breasts. “So you want me to go first or you?”
“Let’s do it together,” Kiran said, getting on his back.
Gatril stooped over his face, stroking his erect manhood. She turned to Scalian with a seductive grin. The other reptile began to tickle her vulva with her tail and fingered her anus.
Kiran grabbed Gatril’s bottom and buried his face between her butt-cheeks as his frisky tongue eagerly wiggled inside her, soaking up all the seeping moisture. Gatril took hard licks of the tip of his member, each causing the boy to twist his toes. Gatril swallowed his penis, bobbing her head slowly, forcing all of him into her throat.
Scalian stuck her tail into her sufficiently moist passage, poking against her cervix with thrusts that made her tense. “Hey…you two…switch now…”
Kiran lifted Gatril off his face, and Gatril spat his penis out of her mouth. She turned around and positioned her vagina over his lap. She sat, slowly guiding Kiran inside her, making both of them moan. Scalian made sounds of euphoria as well.
Gatril grinded rhythmically on top of Kiran, increasing her speed and the intensity. Both of them winced each time Kiran slid deeper into her. She moved fiercely now, both of them wearing intense expressions.
Scalian bit her lips as she thrusted her body parts inside her. Her ears filled with the moans of the two. Fluids seeped out of both ends; where her vagina produced queex, her anus produced smek, however she concentrated more on milking more of her queex for the young man. 
Kiran grip Gatril’s waist and thrust his hip like a piston. Her muscles clenched vice-like, but he kept going like a rocket, creating unbearable friction that had them wincing and bearing their teeth at each other, locked in a battle. Scalian’s body gyrated in coils as the pleasurably waves spread through her like an intoxicating high.
With such intensity among them, it was no surprise when they climaxed simultaneously in a chorus of screams and sighs. Scalian brought the jar to her leaking vagina as she trembled, filling it to the point where it overflowed onto the floor of the cavern.
Gatril sighed and leaned over Kiran’s face as both caught their breath, drenched in sweat. They kissed, gently. They chuckled, and kissed again. 
Gatril got off him, dripping his seed onto the ground. The bosdrake said to Scalian who was lying down, “Are you finished?”
Scalian lifted the jar of viscous matter.
Kiran got up and put on his clothes, eager to get to work. He took the jar from Scalian and said, “Thanks.”
“If you do need anymore, you can visit me again,” Scalian said. “But do bring back some food next time. Now hurry up and go. I usually get hungry after any mating activity, and I’m not very picky.”
Kiran and Gatril hurried outside and went back to his quacycle. Kiran took out the ingredients to add to the mixture; cobalt and volcanic rock he bought from a merchant in his village. He brought them through the same process as he did the last time, creating a small orb, however this one was a pale-yellow color. 
Kiran fitted it into another socket, whereby Gatril said, “What does this one do?”
“I’ll show you.” Kiran got some distance from Gatril and raised his staff. He activated the yellow stone and tapped the ground. There was an abrupt tremor and a huge wall of earth erupted from the earth.
“Is that a shield?” Gatril said.
“Kind of,” said Kiran. “I can use it for defense, or,” Kiran tapped his staff twice, creating two more walls of earth each smaller than the first, “I can use it as leverage.” Kiran climbed onto the rocks and reached the highest one.
“This Witching Tournament is beginning to sound more interesting,” said Gatril. “I wonder, do they allow beasts inside?”
“Only as pets,” said Kiran. He hopped down and approached Gatril, embracing her. “But you’re not a pet. You’re my friend.”
Gatril almost smiled. His words were tainted with the slightest of sincerity. But she had to realize that this was just one human. The others might not be the same. She said, “Don’t pay it much mind. It’s just a consideration. Now where are we off to next?”
“To find a selkie,” he said. “I need a water spell. And hopefully this time I get to taste between their legs.”

CHAPTER THREE

The following day, after resting in the safety of a tree, Kiran and Gatril ate some breakfast of dried meat and fruits and took a bath in the nearby watering hole. At that time Kiran also had to fire a few shots at a pride of lions to scare them off.
Next on their list was finding a selkie, an aquatic beast who fancied itself deep, silent rivers. There was no such place for miles, and the pair ended up going back on the main road. It was hear that Gatril had to cover herself from head to toe with a cloak, as they rode pass a few steam-powered and animal drawn carriages.
