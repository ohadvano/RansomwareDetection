“I'll go tomorrow, you can come with me if you want.” Ryder grins. “I'd love to.”
Chapter 18

Ryder left me alone shortly after he agreed that he would come with me to Max's place tomorrow. For all we know, Max could be innocent in all of this, but with last night still playing on my mind with what my mother told me, the only way I'll feel reassured is if I ask Max about it personally.
I get up from the floor and decide to get dressed and pick the closest towel to dry myself quickly. The clothes Ryder brought for me rest in a pile on top of the bathroom counter. I rummage through the clothes one by one only to notice a lot of indecent clothes I would never wear, I guess they're owned by Silver.
Underneath all the skimpy clothes, I find a plain white t- shirt, put it on hastily and I notice some grey sweatpants lying by the shower that's obviously Ryder's.
A part of me feels that it would be somewhat inappropriate to wear them, but find that I don't have any other choice but to wear the sweats instead.
I smile to myself at the comfort the sweats provide, then leave the bathroom and make my way to the kitchen but stop when I hear two familiar voices and one unrecognizable. I quietly and carefully lean over to look at who the voice belongs to only to see a man standing next to Kellan in a police uniform with salt and pepper hair and very tired eyes. He looks at Ryder soberly who stands in front of him, who has worn a t-shirt by now with his arms crossed over his chest in a relaxed posture.
“Ryder, you know I consider you like a son, but I have to ask you these questions because it's mandatory.”
