Kiran took care to avoid the officers on the street, and instead made his way to the local fish market, attracted by its strong smell. The vicinity was a set of stalls and square spaces covered by tarpaulins so the sun wouldn’t spoil their goods. Fishes of all colors, shapes, textures and sizes from those as small as Kiran’s index finger to ones as large as himself were on display. Some vendors added diversity to their goods with vegetables and other animal meat.
Kiran heard various conversations as he walked by. Some vendors called out to him for a sale, but Kiran either declined or didn’t respond. But soon Kiran’s ears picked up something in his realm of interest. A conversation where the word “selkie” was mentioned more than once.
It came from a fish merchant and a police officer. 
The merchant was an aged woman with a few grey streaks in her plaited hair, however her face still bore a suppleness, the last remnants of youth as the wrinkles under her eyes tried to steal them. Her breasts also stood up despite her not wearing a bra either. 
While she weighed some fish for a customer, she said, “I just told you, sir, I haven’t seen any of those selkies around here for months.”
The guard said, “I don’t believe that. Numerous persons reported seeing selkies in the river scaring them away from the fishes.”
After attending to the customer, the woman gestured to her stall. “Do you see how much fish I caught? I wouldn’t have gotten so much if the selkies were really scaring people. People confuse all kinds of animals and other monsters with selkies. This town is too big and noisy to house monsters. Like I said, I haven’t seen any.”
The guard frowned. “Very well then mam. Thank you for your time.” The guard walked away, but as he did, Kiran, who had been standing close by and pretending to read a map, took a few glances at the woman and found another peculiarity. 
She just so happened to have a huge bulge in her belly. Was she pregnant?
Kiran knew human females couldn’t breed beyond the age of fifty, and she also happened to have a wider variety of fish, and bigger ones at that.
Suspicions tickled Kiran’s nose, and he decided he would do some investigation of his own. 
Kiran waited until evening came, when everyone was starting to pack up after a good day’s sale. Kiran returned to the market and found the woman packing up her things on a cart and pedaled it out of the market. “Okay,” he whispered, hiding in a dark alley as the woman rode by, “time to go.”
Kiran moved by foot, opting for stealth rather than speed and ease of transportation. Not to mention he was quick on his feet too. As the sun set, and the gaslight lamps came on, Kiran skulked from alley to alley behind his target. 
He followed her to a secluded part of the city through a path of fern bushes and noisy crickets. Kiran took out his staff, now cautious of what was lurking around these parts. The woman led him to a cottage built atop a concrete base. It was situated in a damp area with large, smooth stones placed around the house with a walkway leading onto the path. Further from the house was a small stream, further fueling Kiran’s assumptions.
“Now let’s see what happens,” Kiran said, and crouched behind a tree.
The woman parked the cart inside a small shed and proceeded inside the house. Lights came on through the windows, and a lamp outside illuminated the yard. The woman came back out, dressed in a light blue skirt and her hair tied into a bun. She sat on the front porch in a rocking chair, drinking something while she caressed her stomach.
Kiran picked up a fishy smell in the air he hadn’t a few moments ago, but casted it off as just the leftovers coming from the woman’s house. She hummed to herself, adding to the noisy insects, frogs and gurgling stream.
Then Kiran heard splashes.
They came from out of view, east of the river were the growth concealed the rest of its body. The splashes got louder, and the silhouette of the form that made them appeared, thick-bodied with humanoid proportions.
Kiran tightened his grip on his staff. 
He saw the woman stop the rocking chair and stand up. More of the shadowy figures appeared, varying in height with a few short ones. He heard the woman say, “Good evening everyone. How are you?”
The visitors lumbered out of the water and towards the house, into the light that revealed them. They had slick, shiny skin a shade between blue and grey. Their hands and feet were webbed, with a dorsal fin that stemmed from the back of their heads and down their spines. They had large pale eyes and a green neck and belly. Their mouths were wide, their lips thick, and their muscular nostrils large and contracting. The sides of their jaws were lined with gills, and Kiran knew exactly what they were.
“Selkies,” he whispered. 
Kiran contain his excitement, accessing the situation. He glanced at their crotch, but saw only pink, fleshy stubs atop their testicles. There was no female in sight much to Kiran’s dismay. 
The woman approached them eagerly. Three of the selkies the size of children ran towards the woman and hugged her, while the three larger males watched in silence. 
I knew it, Kiran thought. She must’ve been with the selkies. And those ones, they must be her children.
Kiran had heard stories about humans and monsters mating to reproduce under certain circumstances, particular the beasts who possessed human intelligence. Here was something along those lines. But his mission came first, he needed selkie queex for his spell. He didn’t dare face them on his own, and decided he would go back for Gatril.
But as the boy turned around, he was met with two of the selkies staring him down. Kiran froze. “Yikes!”
“Trespasser…” growled one of them. 
Kiran tried to run but a selkie held onto him. Kiran spun around with his staff and activated his force-counter spell. The concussive blast knocked the selkie away, but the other one managed to deliver a backhand to Kiran that immediately stunned him and dropped him on the ground. 
The selkie dove after Kiran. Kiran lifted his staff one more, but the selkie slapped it away. Kiran shrieked and leapt towards it. The selkie grabbed him and threw him into a tree. The burst of pain cause Kiran’s muscles to seize up, and the selkie lifted him by his neck and carried him towards the house.
Kiran struggled, but his strength couldn’t match that of the fishman. This made him realize just how helpless humans were without their magic or weapons.
“What’s this?” the woman said as the selkie dragged the human to the front of the house, tossing him on his hand and knees. 
“A spy, madam…” the selkie said.
Kiran looked up and saw that he was surrounded by the selkies. The smaller ones came curiously close to the human, then retreated when Kiran gave them terrified stares. The other selkie Kiran had knocked down eventually recovered and joined them, holding Kiran’s staff.
Kiran saw the many faces of all shapes, differentiating each selkie, but the commanding stare of the woman was what caught his attention. “Who are you, boy?” she said.
“M-Me?” said Kiran.
“Yes, you!” the woman said. “What are you doing on my property?”
Kiran decided honesty was the best way to get on their soft side, and said, “My name is Kiran Kehomba. I’m a sorcerer in training. I came here searching for the queex of a selkie.”
“Queeeeeex?” a selkie said.
“What is queex?” said one of the children.
“A woman’s crotch juice, son,” said another. He glared at Kiran. “You want to find a selkie woman to rape, human?”
“No! No!” said Kiran. “I’m just trying to find one that’s willing to give me! I-I’m not a sexplorer! Honest! I have a bosdrake friend!”
The woman laughed, while the selkies made guttural chuckles. She said, “Oh really? Then where is this bosdrake friend of your?”
“Here!” Gatril leaped out of the bushes. “Let the human go!”
Kiran said, “Gatril! How did you find me?”
“I followed your scent,” she said. “When you didn’t make it back this evening, I figured something might have happened to you. I told you you’re too stupid to go about on your own.”
“This boy trespassed on my property,” said the woman. “He’ll have to pay for it.”
Gatril accessed her second stomach and spat a ball of acid. The selkies hurried away from the steaming blob that melted into the ground. “And I say we talk about it,” said Gatril. “Do you really want to start a fight with the children here?”
The selkies turned to the woman after being unable to come to their own conclusion. The human female noticed Gatril’s tense posture and her clenched fists. After looking at the innocent faces of the young ones, the woman said, “Very well. We’ll talk inside my house.”
The woman brought them into the living room, instructing them to sit. She was accompanied by two of the males, who stood at her sides as guards. Kiran sat close to Gatril.
“My name is Eyeka,” said the woman. “You said you were a sorcerer, boy?”
“Yeah,” Kiran replied. “My friend hear is Gatril. She decided to help get the ingredients for my spells.”
“A bosdrake…” said Eyeka. “To think you would venture this far with a human companion.”
“And to think you would be breeding for beasts,” said Gatril, glancing at Eyeka’s stomach. “I would like to hear the story behind it.”
“It’s a simple one,” said Eyeka. “You see, the selkie men on my property have a bit of a problem. Their females have been kidnapped by various bandits and sold to sexplorers around the kingdoms. So they came to me with a proposal; I would bare their children, and they would provide me with enough fish to increase the profit of my business.”
“Wait,” said Kiran. “Were they really scaring away the people who come to the river?”
“Can you blame them?” said Eyeka. “Their women have been taken as slaves, and they’re under constant attack from monster hunters and the Riverwench. Their population is shrinking.” Eyeka rubbed her stomach. “But I think this time, I’ll give birth to a female.”
“Wait a minute,” said Kiran. “Did you just say a Riverwench?”
“Yes,” said one of the selkies. “She lives in a nest nearby, terrorizing everything in the river.”
“I’ve never heard a creature like that before,” said Gatril. She turned to young man, who was deep in his thoughts. “What is it, Kiran?”
He said, “It’s closely related to a selkies. She’s a female selkie that underwent a special mutation due to eating certain foods. They’re big and aggressive. But I’m surprised the selkies didn’t try to mate with her.”
“We did try,” said one of selkies. “She ate the males that approached her.”
“Ouch,” said Gatril.
Then Kiran said, “Why I am interested is that I can get the same ingredients for my spell from her.”
“You can?” said Gatril.
“Yeah,” Kiran said. “It’s dangerous. I didn’t want to fight monsters of that category without my spells, that’s why I was saving the J’bafofi for last. But,” Kiran looked at the concerned faces of the others, “I think I might need to now.”
“You would dare to challenge the Riverwench?” one of the males said.
“Well, she’s not as dangerous as a J’bafofi,” said Kiran. “If I have Gatril with me, we just might be able to do it.”
“It would be a huge favor to us,” said Eyeka. “The selkies could begin to expand territory if that beast is gone.”
Kiran smiled. “Think of it as a way of me repaying you for trespassing.” He turned to Gatril. “What do you say, you trust me to get this done?”
Gatril sighed. “You haven’t displayed exemplary leadership so far. But I’m still stupid enough to follow you.”
Minutes later, Kiran and Gatril were led up the side of the stream by three of the selkies. The water-body became a river, getting deeper the further they went. The moonlight above was adequate over the water, but being a human, Kiran lent his trust to his lantern. The river wound through the jungle, and they came upon a settlement of straw huts on the river banking where they met around twenty other selkies. Men and children. 
“It looks like their population really is shrinking,” said Gatril.
Their escort waved away the curious onlookers, assuring they meant no harm, and brought the human and bosdrake to a section of the river where a sort of wooden fence had been built across the water. The top was sharpened to points that leaned in the other direction as a deterrent from anything rushing towards the settlement.
Gatril had seen similar things built by tribes around their homes when they wished to keep predators at bay, and the selkies probably did it to bar off crocodiles and raging hippos.
A selkie who they’d come to know as Tokko pointed over the fence and said, “Over that barrier is where the Riverwench lives. The beast is dangerous. She’s taken on three of our finest fighters at a time and bested them. Be careful.”
Kiran readied his gun. “Thanks for the help. Come on Gatril.”
Kiran made his way around the barrier that had spread even further inland, trekking back to the riverbanks with Gatril leading the way with the lantern now in her hand. They had spotted the reflective eyes of crocodiles in the river, but they smelt Gatril’s presence and kept at away. 
“I wonder how her lair would look?” Kiran’s voice was both curious and concerned.
“Probably something like that,” said Gatril, pointing to massive construct that ran from the edge of the river and into jungle. The two of them could only describe it as a colossal, horizontal termite mound of vines and sticks woven together.
Kiran clutched his weapon tighter. Too many times he had been panicking when encountering these beasts. He needed to muster his resolve once and for all. He turned to Gatril and said, “Do you smell anything?”
“I smell her,” Gatril said, “and something…rotten.” Gatril crept closer to the nest when her eye caught something. She washed the light of the lantern over it, revealing gnawed bones of various animals littering the place.
Kiran studied the remains and found among remains the parts of crocodiles, deer, gazelles, hippos, lions, selkies, and humans. “…This place…it’s…” He shuddered.
A deep hiss suddenly crackled in the air. Kiran and Gatril scampered away from the nest. “She knows we’re here!” said Gatril.
“Quick!” said Kiran. “Set the nest on fire!”
Gatril tossed the lantern upon the nest with so much force the glass shattered, splashing the flammable liquid everywhere. The crackling and snapping of the oxidation of the nest and its subsequent combustion spread along with the flames.
Kiran had an idea, and said to Gatril, “Do you know how to use a gun?”
“Just point and pull the trigger, right?” she said.
He tossed the gun to her and said, “The cartridge has four shots. They’re sticky rounds, so aim at her feet.”
And just as Kiran got his staff ready, the nest burst outward. Thrashing arms flung debris from the face of the beast. It stood at eight feet tall, squat built with green-brown skin. Its large head was vaguely humanoid but the green eyes were wide-set, along with a massive mouth. It had long, wiry webbed arms and a large dorsal fin. Its hair was long and stringy, soaked in some kind of fluid. But what caught Kiran’s eyes besides the toothy maw were the smooth, dangling breasts and her scaly vagina, slick and wet.
The Riverwench opened her mouth and said, “You dare to burn down my home, insects?”
“Says the one eating people left and right!” Gatril replied.
The Riverwench snarled. “I’ll devour you and turn you into dung!”
Kiran set the orbs on his staff alight. “Gatril, shoot when you have an opening!” Kiran charged ahead. He tapped his staff and raised a column of earth. 
The Riverwench smashed it with her arm and dove after Kiran. The human leaped out of the way and rolled onto his feet, immediately unleashing consecutive concussive blasts. But they only staggered the beast and enraged her. 
Gatril fired at her feet. The sticky ball exploded around the Riverwench’s ankles and affixed it to the ground.
The beast shrieked and lifted her foot along with the dirt, freeing herself. “Wretches and your witchery!”
“The ground is too loose!” said Kiran. “Head further into the forest!”
But the Riverwench was too fast, rushing towards Gatril now that she realized their plan. The bosdrake barely leapt out of the way of the beast’s arm. The Riverwench swung her claws, but Gatril was able evade all of them, then spat a stream of acid in retaliation. The Riverwench lifted her arm, screaming when the liquid sizzled her flesh. She struck with her foot and sent Gatril flying across the ground.
“Gatril!” Kiran ran towards the monstrous fish, tapping the ground and raising a set of mounds before him. He leaped onto them and launched himself at the Riverwench. But he was wide open, and the Riverwench swung her arm back for a deathly. 
Just as Kiran had predicted.
Kiran shot out a blast that propelled him higher and over the creature’s head as she swung at nothing. He landed and twisted his ankle, letting out a loud yelp. The pain was intense but he blocked it from his mind and continued with his plan. Kiran tapped the ground and raise it beneath the creature’s feet. He fired another concussive blast that toppled the Riverwench.
Kiran suddenly felt a grip around his waist. It was Gatril, on her feet. She ran with Kiran into the woods. And the Riverwench got up and went after them.
“Can you walk?” Gatril said.
“Not fast enough!” said Kiran. 
Gatril put the gun into her mouth and quickly climbed a tree. She laid Kiran near a large enough limb and gave the gun to him. “Now you stay here! I’ll get her attention!” and Gatril looked down at the Riverwench.
She spotted the two up in the tree and said, “Do you think I cannot climb a tree, fools?”
Gatril grinned at her, and said, “Don’t worry! I’m coming for you!” 
Gatril leapt out of the tree and the Riverwench opened her mouth. But Gatril spat acid in it. The Riverwench choked and coughed out the fluid before it could do any damage. Gatril ran around and threw her feet, cutting away at the Riverwench’s flesh to reach the tendons, using the trees as leverage and shield as her taller adversary tried to grab her.
Fortunately for the Riverwench, her stamina outlasted Gatril’s, allowing her to finally catch the bosdrake with a big swing of her arm, launching Gatril into a tree.
Gatril’s whole body succumbed to the blow and she fell. She saw the Riverwench coming in for the finishing blow, but couldn’t find the strength to move, crippled by the searing pain from a broken rib. Gatril prepared her last line of defense and brought up acid in her throat, but she hesitated when there was a muffled explosion and the other female suddenly found herself stuck.
Alarmed, the Riverwench looked down and saw black, rubbery matter around her foot. Kiran fired a second shot that glued her other foot to the ground. The human carefully climbed down the tree as the Riverwench tried to twist her feet free, but the wounds dealt by Gatril stole the strength from her muscles.
Seizing the chance, Gatril spat acid on the Riverwench’s right shoulder. She screamed and leered at the bosdrake. “I’ll kill you!”
Kiran went over to Gatril and shouldered some of her weight on him, gently lifting her. “Are you alright?” he said.
“I’ll be fine once we get to screw her,” said Gatril. Then she turned to the giant. “Hey, you!”
The Riverwench ignored them and continued to try and free her foot. Her arm strength wasn’t up to par thanks to Gatril strategically targeting her shoulder. Finally giving up, the Riverwench knelt and her hands and knees, breathing heavily.
“Curses…” she sneered. “To be beaten by the likes of prey like you. Go ahead, finish me.”
“No,” said Kiran. “That’s not what I’m here for.” Kiran wasn’t a man with a lust for blood, but he had to remember the monster wasn’t innocent. “I’m a sorcerer. I need your queex in order to complete a spell.”
“Sorcerer,” said the Riverwench. “Of course. You used magic. What…is my queex?”
“The juice from your womb,” said Kiran. “If you allow me to mate with you, I’ll set you free. So long as you move somewhere else where you won’t hurt selkies or humans.”
The Riverwench made something between a scowl and a frown. “You, mate with me? Absurd! It would be a disgrace to let my prey mount me. I rather die than be humiliated!”
“Really?” said Gatril. “Are you sure your life is worth less than swallowing a human cock?”
The Riverwench looked at the bosdrake, then the human. Both of who wore spiteful grins. She weighed her option, and the large female hung her head and growled. “Very well. If you promise to set me free, I’ll allow you to mate with me.”
“Definitely,” said Kiran. He gave his weapon to Gatril and took a jar out of his backpack. “Since you’re already on your hands and knees, just hold still.”
Kiran made his way around the back of the Riverwench, while Gatril kept a watchful eye on her. Kiran took off his pants and faced her behind, met with her vagina presenting itself to him. Knelt over like this, the Riverwench’s bottom reached just below Kiran’s chest, and he stooped to plan his face in her crotch. 
She had a slight fishy smell mixed with garlic and honey, which translated over to the taste when Kiran stuck his tongue inside her. The Riverwench shuddered as Kiran’s tongue slithered inside her, flailing against her clitoris like a slippery fish. She tried to bite back her moans to deny the human the satisfaction of pleasuring her, even going so far as to cover her mouth. She gripped the dirt in her hands as her body contorted, making guttural sounds as the human licked, sucked and drank from her. But Kiran was too much, and is no time the Riverwench dropped her hand and uttered a deep, long groan. 
Her body practically quaked as her queex poured into the jar and all over Kiran’s face.
“Whoa!” said Gatril. “She couldn’t handle it.” 
The Riverwench hung her head between her arms, closing her eyes in embarrassment. “Damned human…”
Gatril walked around to where Kiran was, and said, “The air smells strong from the queex. Let me try some.”
The Riverwench abruptly lifted her head. “What?”
Without warning Gatril licked the female’s labia and shot her tongue inside with electrifying grace. She grabbed the Riverwench’s bottom and held her steady as she contorted out of control, still sensitive from Kiran’s first round. 
“In that case,” said Kiran as he corked the jar and put it away in his backpack, “I’ll deal with you face-to-face.”
Kiran went to the Riverwench’s head and held her cheeks. She spotted the reddish tip of his veiny manhood and shuddered. “W-What are you doing?”
“Just letting off some steam,” said Kiran. “You don’t want to?”
Gatril nibbled on her clitoris and the Riverwench abruptly reeled like a horse, falling back on her hands. “P-Please!” she said. “I won’t eat humans or selkies anymore! This is embarrassing! Just let—”
Kiran silenced her by ramming his phallus into her mouth. The Riverwench choked and grabbed his waist to prevent him from thrusting, but her last orgasm left her a tad weary, powerless to stop Kiran from pounding her face. His balls slapped against her chin, and he closed his eyes and threw back his head as his mind melted away.
“Wow, you have a good mouth,” Kiran said, but his sex mate could only reply with garbled sounds and saliva running from her mouth. 
The Riverwench’s body shuddered once again as another orgasm consumed her. She clenched Kiran’s waist tighter to the point where he felt he was going to break.
“Ouch!” he said. “Hey, careful!”
Gatril took her face out of the Riverwench’s behind, licking the excess fluids from her lips. “Hey, Kiran. I’m hot over here.”
Kiran stopped, the Riverwench sighed inwardly. “Okay. Come over here and I’ll help you out.”
Kiran pulled out of the Riverwench’s mouth. He let go of her and she laid her head on her arms. “I-I’m so tired.”
“Don’t worry,” said Kiran. “I’ve already got what I wanted.”
Gatril grabbed Kiran’s penis. “Yeah,” she said, “now you’re gonna give me what I want.”
Kiran and Gatril quickly finished up in the missionary position. His thrusts and her contractions produced and intense heat in their groins that had them climaxing almost instantaneously. 
They recovered and gathered their belongings, after which they cut the rubbery material from around the Riverwench’s feet. She stood unsteadily, almost losing her balance. She made no hostile action but her face wore an expression of pure hate.
“Okay,” said Kiran, “you will have to leave the jungle now. Or you can stay and leave the selkies and humans alone.”
She grunted. “Fine,” she said. “I will stay, and keep away from them.”
“Good,” said Gatril. “Or we’ll come back here and give you some more good loving.”
“Thank you miss Riverwench,” said Kiran. “Your queex will really help me. Well, we’ll be leaving now.”
“Wait,” she said. “before you go…at least know my name. I’m not a whore for a human to mount and leave.”
Kiran said, “Okay… What is your name?”
“Kundis,” she said. “That is the name I choose to go by.”
Kiran nodded. “Kundis. That’s a nice name.”
Kundis didn’t smile at the compliment, but simply said. “I need to rebuild my nest. Good night, Kiran.” And she turned and went into the trees.
Kiran held Gatril’s hand. “Come on. Let’s go back.”

After Kiran returned to the cottage and reported the news to Eyeka and the selkies, he was given their gratitude, which was enough for him, even though Gatril urged him to ask her for her queex.
The pair snuck back to the inn under the cover of night. Kiran had himself a bath in the shower, as Gatril had already cleaned herself in the river. When Kiran returned to his room he relaxed in the bed next to Gatril, both naked. There was no arousal amongst them, but they enjoyed the warmth of each other.
It was in the middle of the night when Kiran was awakened to Gatril munching on some meat in the corner of the room. He rubbed the stagnation out of his eyes and said, “Late night snack?”
“Well, I can’t exactly go downstairs,” she said, taking another bite of her jaguar meat.
Kiran chuckled and rolled out of the covers. He put on his underpants, ran his hands through his dreadlocks and went over to the wardrobe where he had his things. “I might as well work on the spell while I’m up.”
Kiran took out the jar of queex along with a paper containing fish scales and powdered aquamarine stone. He sat on the floor before Gatril, sneaking glances at her as he worked. 
“Is something wrong?” said Gatril.
“I was just thinking,” Kiran said as he poured the powder and fish scales into the jar, “why did you really come with me; a human?”
Gatril said, “You still don’t trust me?”
“No, I do trust you,” Kiran said. “I just find it strange that a beast would want to go on an adventure with a human. Don’t you have any beast friends?”
Gatril shook her head. “There aren’t many where I’m from.”
Kiran said, “I heard there aren’t many bosdrakes left in Aardel. Do you ever got lonely not being around others like you?”
“…Sometimes,” Gatril said. She stared out the window at the luminous moon. “I don’t even know where my family is. Our kind usually scatters once we grow older, tending to live by ourselves. We like our own territory, but…sometimes company can be nice.”
Kiran had finished rolling the substance into a green-blue sphere and put it in his staff below the white orb. He tapped the staff once and put it down, giving Gatril his attention. “Well, I’m here with you. And I’m really glad you’re with me, helping me out.”
Gatril turned to Kiran and smiled. “Yes. So am I.”

CHAPTER FOUR

Kiran and Gatril woke early the next morning to continue their journey. 
Kiran brushed his teeth and went to the kitchen to get them breakfast, returning with two plates dumplings, chopped pumpkins and stewed beef. 
After their meal Kiran gathered his things and went outside to his quacycle, then rode around the back of the inn where Gatril leaped over the fence to meet him. She wore her cloak to conceal her appearance. The bosdrake hopped onto the human’s quacycle, and together they rode out of Wopol and onto the main road.
“The popobawa,” said Gatril. “These are forest creatures, right?”
“Yeah,” said Kiran. “They’re a bit dangerous too. They come out at night to feed on blood. But they disguise themselves as humans in the day time.”
“They also have good agility, I heard,” Gatril said, “I’m not very good with flying foes either, and I still haven’t fully recovered from our fight with Kundis.”
“We can camp and rest when night falls,” said Kiran. “I heard reports of a popobawa in a forest near Dehafi Town. That’s three miles from here.”
“Okay, boss man,” said Gatril. 
Their journey took them around a small hillside that overlooked a vast plain and mountains in the distance, where the morning became brighter and warmer. Just beyond the mountains in the east lay the country of Gobanyi, where Kiran knew young magical practitioners like himself were prepare for the Witching Tournament. It got him wondering how well his spells would fare against the techniques of the others.
Of course I’ll do fine, he thought. I’m going through so much trouble to get rare spells after all.
As they descend onto flat grassland, the town of Dehafi rose into view. Its most dominant features were pillars of black smoke spewing from the factories. The distance between the town and the human-bosdrake pair was occupied by scattered trees that loomed over the swaying grass, grass being tended to by grazing gazelles and zebras.
Kiran and Gatril weren’t looking out for anything out of the ordinary, concerned only with reaching the town, yet something amongst the animals managed to snag their attention.
“Whoa, what’s that over there?” said Gatril.
“Huh?” Kiran parked his quacycle along the road. He looked in the direction Gatril gestured to, and spotted someone in a dusty robe kneeling next to one of the zebras. “Who is that?”
“There’s only one way to find out if you really want to know,” said Gatril.
Kiran turned off the engine and he and Gatril got off the vehicle. They made their way through the grass, kicking up bugs with each step. Some of the animals scattered but the one the person was next to didn’t budge an inch. And when they got close enough, they saw what was really happening.
The stranger was a woman. She wore a red tunic and a shiny, green fabric wrapped around her waist and draped over her shoulder. Kiran recognized it as a sari, and coupled with the woman’s brown skin and black, straight her, he deduced her origins as a Gabanyese from the neighboring country.
But it was what she was doing rather than her nationality that captivated Gatril and him.
The zebra’s penis was fully erect, which the woman stroked and sucked on fiercely with slurping sounds and lots of froth.
“Wow, she’s really working it,” said Gatril.
Kiran looked at her indifferently. He was not disgusted in the sense of the word, but he didn’t fancy sexual activity with animals. What differentiated beasts from animals was the fact that they had human intelligence and at least human-like features; breasts and genitals shaped like that of a human female. 
“Excuse me, lady?” Kiran said.
The woman held a finger for their silence, and continued to stimulate the animal until her cheeks abruptly puffed, spilling semen from the corners of her mouth. She made a choking sound as she held a little of the fluid in her throat. She reached for a jar on the ground, pulled the throbbing, dark phallus out of her mouth and spat the semen into a jar. 
As the strange woman got up and wiped her mouth, Kiran noticed a knapsack at her feet and the crude handle of a pistol in her waist. She looked at the pair with black eyes, smirking a little as if please with herself.  “Yes, may I help you two?” she said.
Kiran and Gatril looked at each other, and the bosdrake gesture to the woman urgently. Kiran said, “Excuse me. I didn’t mean to intrude. I was riding by when I saw you here. I guess this is a bad time?”
“No,” she said. “I’m just about finished.” She took up the knapsack and put the jar inside. Shouldering it, she said, “So, why is a human travelling with a bosdrake?”
“I’m his friend with benefits,” said Gatril, slapping Kiran’s bottom.
The woman smiled. “I see. My name is Aparna.”
“My name is Kiran,” the young man said. “And this is Gatril. I’m a sorcerer.”
“I could tell,” said Aparna, gesturing to Kiran’s staff. “I guess you could call me a sorceress then.”
It was as if someone quickly wound up Kiran, straighten his back and widening his eyes. “Really? You practice magic too?”
Aparna nodded. “I was getting this zebra semen for my spell.” Aparna looked Kiran with heightened curiosity. “Wait, would you be entering the Witching Tournament by any chance?”
“Yeah,” said Kiran. “I’m here trying to get some popobawa queex.”
Aparna said, “Really? That sounds a little dangerous though. I know a few people who got attacked by them. They got their blood drank, some even got raped. I heard they used to attack the townsfolk until they got guns and killed them off. Now only one lurks in the forest nearby, but no one dares to venture inside.”
“That’s no problem,” said Gatril. “We fought something much scarier than that just yesterday. Do you happen to live around here?”
“No,” said Aparna. “I’m actually visiting from Gabanyi. I came here for a few ingredients that could only be found on this side of the continent. So far I’ve gotten two of the four. I need the queex of a brustark and the semen of a dandepuffer.”
“Those aren’t easy animals to capture either,” said Gatril. “Especially the brustark.”
“Don’t worry,” said Aparna. She gestured to the zebra behind her, now going about its business grazing. “I can drug them like I did this one.”
“Dandepuffers are close to my village,” said Kiran. “Opposite of where I found you, Gatril.”
Something had been bothering Gatril, and she said, “But Kiran, she just mentioned that the popobawa usually rape people. Are they all males, or do they also have females?”
“They are a bit of both,” said Kiran. “They tend to look like females, but they have a five-inch-long clitoris they use to have intercourse with and release semen. I just need to knock her out and capture her.”
“Okay,” said Gatril. “You know Kiran, you’re starting to sound like a real sexplorer.”
“No,” said Kiran. “I always ask nicely for their queex first. The last beast was killing and eating innocent people, like the popobawa are. I’ve never killed anyone either.”
Gatril didn’t protest any further, but said, “Well we better get some rest. I think it’s best we do it tomorrow night after we’ve recovered.”
“You’re both welcome to stay with me if you want,” said Aparna. “I have enough space in my room that I booked.”
“Really? Thanks!” said Kiran. 
“No problem,” said Aparna. “It’s a pleasure to help a fellow practitioner of magic.”
Gatril groaned and rubbed her head. “Ah, I’m not too fancying going into human territory every minute. I know this question might sound off topic, but isn’t there a place where humans and beasts get together?”
Kiran folded his arms and looked at the ground as he tried to figure out something that could help. “Hmph.” Kiran unfolded his arms and looked at the two women. “There’s a place called a Furshack where humans and beasts meet, but that’s way on the north coast where the ships dock. Even if we could afford to refuel my quacycle, it will take around five days to reach there.”
Gatril frowned. “Nah, forget it. We don’t have enough resources or tools to defend ourselves. Let’s just finish up with your task and then we’ll get a move on. I’ll just stick around here by myself.”
“Are you serious?” said Kiran. 
“Boy,” said Gatril, “I’ve been living on my own for years. This won’t be anything.” Gatril abruptly pulled close and whispered in his ear. “Now go and have some fun with your new friend here. But make sure she washes the semen out of her mouth first.”
Kiran frowned at her. “Really, Gatril?”
“Stop being a wimp and let’s get going,” Gatril said, walking back to the quacycle with the others.
Kiran towed the vehicle next to him in a walking pace with the two females. Once they were close to the town, Gatril gestured a few trees that she would mark as the checkpoint for Kiran to meet her outside.
Aparna took Kiran by the hand and lead him through the streets, careful to avoid the prostitutes, police, back-alley merchants and other unscrupulous characters lurking about. Kiran’s interest in his new, taller companion wasn’t subtle either, as he kept sneaking stares at her face and chest. But it wasn’t by the influence of his hormones either, for he wondered what kind of magic she possessed in her arsenal.
They came to a white building that was the inn. Inside Aparna showed the receptionist her key and they allowed her and Kiran upstairs to the rooms.
“Right here, Kiran,” Aparna said as she brought them to a door at the end of the hallway, next to a window that glowed white from the sunlight.
Aparna opened the door and they went inside. The walls were made from clay, polished and painted in a beige color. The caretakers had put more effort in making the walls and ceiling more ornate, and the room carried a sweet scent of vanilla.
Aparna turned to Kiran and said as she took off her knapsack and cloak, “Make yourself comfortable.”
“…Sure.” Kiran put down his knapsack on the table next to Aparna’s and took off his shoes. 
He saw that one of the beds was untouched and chose that one to lay down in—and abruptly looked up when he saw Aparna stripping down to nothing but her underwear. Aparna’s slender frame manage to have enough curves to entice Kiran, and her bottom, though small, was well rounded.
Kiran realized his eyes weren’t coming off her and he closed them, finally looking away. Aparna hung her clothes on a rack and took out a beaded necklace from a drawer. “So Kiran,” she said, sitting on the other bed and looking across at him, “what kind of spells have you gathered so far?”
Kiran, relieved they had a productive conversation at hand, reached for his staff at the bedside and showed her the orbs. “These are all hardened queex from monsters. This is Gatril’s, this is from a lamia and the other is from a Riverwench.”
“You really fought a Riverwench?” Aparna said.
“Sure did,” said Kiran. “The first orb is a force-counter spell. The second one is an earth-pillar spell, and the third pulls water from the atmosphere; for when I’m travelling and run out of something to drink.”
“That’s resourceful,” said Aparna. “You know, those spells can be created in other ways with similar materials, right?”
“I know,” said Kiran. “But my grandfather told me that in the old days, before magic merchants got tons of the materials and started selling it, wizards had to find their ingredients the old fashion way. And my grandfather says I’ll need the combat experience.”
“Doing it old school, huh?” Aparna said.
“Yep,” Kiran replied. “So what kind of spell do you have?”
Aparna gestured with the necklace. “Mostly charms, like this one. It wards off hexes from other people. Each of these white beads can absorb a hex, but they turn to dust afterwards. In that case I would need to make a new one. I had to buy the ingredients for this once. It costed a lot, so that’s why I’m trying the old school way, like you.”
“Okay,” he said. “And the zebra semen, what will you do with that?”
Aparna said, “If I add some sand and onions, I can harden it into a crystal that will enable me to sense vibrations on solid surfaces.”
Kiran realized something about the two spells Aparna mentioned, something he read about and also told to him by his grandfather. “Aparna, your spells, they’re passive ones, aren’t they?”
“That’s right,” she said, amused Kiran was able to deduce it. “These spells actively feed off the user’s spirit energy and are active even when the user doesn’t think about it, so long as their spirit energy has not been diminished. While active ones, like your force-counter and earth-pillar, rely on you to command it in your mind and channel your spirit energy manually. But the Witching Tournament is also about flashy spells, so my next two will give me enhanced strength and the ability to make things float.”
“It looks like you’re going for a close-combat type of combination,” said Kiran. 
“It is,” said Aparna, getting up. “I’m going to brush my teeth. I have a spell book on the table you can check out if you want.”
“Oh, nice!” Kiran leapt up and towards the table. He snatched up the book and fell back in the bed. 
Kiran studied the texts in the book until Aparna got back. They delved into a conversation about which kind of magic combination was the most efficient, and recalled the most famous magic practitioners of past. No sex was brought up, not that Kiran was feeling particularly lusty, but more than once Gatril crossed his mind.
Three hours later they left the inn and decided to scout out the location of the forest, moving on foot to conserve the fuel of Kiran’s quacycle. Though Kiran walked around with Aparna, there were a few other foreigners in the town as well, easterners like Aparna and northerners whose light skin made them stand out like a giraffe amongst zebras.
Within little over half an hour they were able to find the street that ran from the heart of the town and into the forest. It also bore a small police port, were a few officers were stationed as lookout for potential smugglers and monsters, even incorporating a tower for an enhanced point of view.
Kiran and Aparna slowed their approach as an officer came to meet them. Kiran noticed his eyes paid more attention to Aparna, but he wasn’t surprised.
“Good afternoon children,” said the officer. “Where are you both headed?”
“Sir,” said Kiran, and the man switched his lustful gaze from Aparna to an annoyed one when he saw Kiran. “My name is Kiran Kehomba. I’m a sorcerer in training. I’ve come from my town to try and find popobawa parts for my spell. My friend her is accompanying me.”
“My name is Aparna,” she said. “I’m also a sorceress. We’re both trying to find resources to enter the Witching Tournament. I have a permit to enter this country and participate if you’d like to see.”
“Sure,” said the officer, “let me have them.”
Kiran and Aparna took out their IDs, and the officer gave Kiran’s a quick glance and handed it back to him. However, he carefully ran his fingers over Aparna’s hand as he took hers. She frowned and wiped her hands in her clothes, but the officer merely cackled and looked at her identification. “Aparna Borasing. Gabanyese, eh?”
“Yes,” she said. 
“Are we allowed to venture into the forest, sir?” said Kiran.
“…We don’t recommend it,” the man said thoughtfully. “If you do enter the forest however, you’ll have to sign a contract with the authorities giving your consent to be the ones solely responsible for your own wellbeing.”
“Sure,” said Kiran. “We’ll sign once we’re coming back. Come on Aparna.”
The young woman snatched her ID from the officer and followed Kiran back into town. They decided to take a walk along one of the factories to explore how far the advancements in technology in the country had gone. 
The facility was surrounded by a large fence of wooden posts, and through the large open door, the two could see trolleys and small carts carrying hunks of metal to and from the back.
Kiran looked up at the sign which read “Okoyo’s Engine Repair Service”. “Do you think they made a spell that can combine magic and machines?” said Kiran.
“Not to my knowledge,” said Aparna. “I don’t think that would even be allowed in the tournament either.”
“Would’ve been cool though,” Kiran said. “I know you have knights who are good at using gadgets.”
“Gadgets malfunction, spells don’t,” Aparna snapped. “Let’s go already. I still need to get the tingle of that policeman off me.”
Kiran shrugged and continued with Aparna back to the inn. While Kiran studied his book of spells once more, Aparna was just about finished with her knew spell, having gathered the ingredients to mix with the zebra semen and turn into an orb. She had a large bracelet with three sockets, one of which she fitted the orb into. Aparna channeled her spirit energy into the stone and locked the bracelet around her foot.
“Okay, all done,” said Aparna.
Kiran closed the book and sat up. “Okay. Let’s go see what Gatril’s up to.”
The two took his quacycle and rode out of the town. On the outskirts they made their way to the set of trees Gatril had indicated to them, only to find a giant, round mass of branches bent and woven into a nest.
“What in the world is that?” said Aparna.
“Don’t worry,” said Kiran as he parked his vehicle outside from the structure. “I think she just made a house.”
They got off and walked towards the nest, though Aparna kept a cautious distance behind Kiran. The boy turned on a new lantern he bought and carefully brought its light close to the entrance of the nest. “Gatril…?”
“What?” The voice came from behind them, and both humans spun around hysterically to see Gatril falling from the tree.
“G-Gatril!” Kiran said. “Don’t scare us like that!”
“That wasn’t nice, dragon,” said Aparna, her hand on the grip of her gun. “I could’ve shot you.”
“If you did, I would’ve bitten your head off.” And Gatril smiled, displaying her formidable teeth.
Kiran quickly went between them and said, “Hey, you two knock it off. We just came here to see how you are Gatril.”
“Check this out Kiran,” said Gatril. She turned away from everyone, inhaled briefly, and exhaled from her throat a stream of cloudy, green substance in the air. Kiran and Aparna got a whiff of it and immediately felt their heads going fuzzy and their knees buckling.
“Gyaaah!” Kiran covered his nose and hurried out of the mist. He fell on his knees. “G-Gatril, what is this stuff?”
Aparna fell on her bottom, wrapping her mouth and nose with her cloak. 
Gatril was all smiles despite the unhealthy predicament of her comrades. “You guys like it? It’s a special plant I ate. Bosdrakes have the ability to regurgitate specific chemicals in the food we eat.”
As the green fog disappeared, Kiran and Aparna rose to their feet, taking deep breaths so their lungs could recover. 
“You could’ve at least given us a warning,” said Aparna.
“That would’ve spoiled the surprise,” said Gatril. “Kiran, did you bring any food?”
“…Yeah,” he said. He handed her the basket. 
Gatril took it and flung the top open. “Hmmm, pork,” she said, the fragrance immediately watering her mouth. 
“We better leave fun time for tomorrow night,” said Kiran. “We’ll need all our strength against the popobawa. I’ll sleep out here with you tonight just to make sure we’re safe.”
“I told you already, I don’t need your company,” said Gatril.
“It’s not up for discussion.” Kiran crept into the nest and carefully placed the lantern in the center of the floor of matted leaves. He put his knapsack in the corner along with Gatril’s small items.
“Excuse me,” said Aparna. “What do you two mean by, funtime?”
Gatril swallowed the piece of meat in her mouth and said, “Sex.”
“…I see,” said Aparna. “You two seem to have quiet the relationship.”
“We’re just friends with benefits,” said Gatril.
Aparna made a lopsided grin. “He’s a really good friend to be staying out here around predators with a dragon.”
Aparna’s words slipped into Gatril’s ears like a salted worm, wriggling about and stirring up unwanted thoughts—thoughts she didn’t want to entertain. “He’s a good human. That’s why I’m following him. Now are you going to come inside or not?”
“I’ll head back to the inn,” said Aparna, a slick smile on her lips.
“Good,” said Gatril. “Now go away and leave me and my friend alone.”
Aparna chuckled and made her way back to the town.
The following evening, Kiran went back in town to pick up fuel for his quacycle, and on his way out he fetched Aparna. He returned with her to Gatril’s hut, getting her to add the final piece to his party. The trio rode around town, testing the limits of the single large seat with the women behind Kiran; Gatril in the center. As a result, their weight made their pace slow, but they had intended to pay keen attention to their surroundings.
Along with the lantern Kiran had placed at the front of his vehicle, Aparna steadily held a torch in her hand despite the slight bumps on the road. Gatril’s keen sense of smell, sight and hearing would also alert them to anyone their lights couldn’t reveal. Despite a few critters and the croaks and chirps of the nocturnal residents, they found nothing out of the ordinary.
“We’re here,” said Kiran as they reached the cluster of trees. Darkness stared back at them, silent and waiting.
“We should stop here and set up bait,” said Aparna.
Kiran said, “Good idea,” and proceeded to park the vehicle in the grass along the path.
Kiran went to the back of the quacycle and took out the items needed to attract the popobawa. 
The popobawas were beings with an appetite for blood, so Kiran took out a jar of cow’s blood and poured it into a bucket, enhancing the fragrance with special chemicals. Gatril helped to place it on a large piece of wood similar to a rat trap, only instead of throwing over an iron bar to crush whatever would take the bait, it had a hollow holder container a powdered plant that would be launched at the unsuspecting victim. The powder of the plant would then paralyze the target when inhaled.
They carried the trap a few yards into the forest, knowing the popobawa wouldn’t want to venture out of its cover, and quickly sprinted out of the trees before their prey caught on to them. 
Kiran, Gatril and Aparna crouched in a nearby brush, silently waiting on the popobawa to take the bait.
“How long will we have to be here?” said Gatril.
“I don’t know,” said Kiran.
They heard and abrupt sound. A creaking one of sorts. It struck them silent, and they strained their ears.
Aparna said, “That…sounded like the trap, Kiran.”
“Already?” Kiran sounded incredulous. 
Gatril, unlike the humans, immediately realized what was going on. “It’s the trap alright, but way too soon. Something must’ve seen us coming—or has been waiting on us.”
“W-What?” Kiran sounded panicky. “B-But who?”
Something landed before them. They sprung up and scattered themselves to get room to commence battle. 
“What the hell was that?” Kiran said. He quickly switched on the lantern, revealing the bucket of blood. 
“It threw the bucket back!” Aparna said.
Gatril went to Kiran and took the lantern from him. “What are you doing?” he said.
Gatril ignored Kiran and tossed it in the grass near the trees. With the dry weather they were having, the ground quickly caught fire. Gatril retreated with the others, waiting impatiently as adrenaline surged through her veins.
“Come on you bastard,” Gatril sneered.
Then their adversary walked into the light, his formed revealed. The officer from the forest lookout post.
“You!” Kiran said.
“I knew I felt something off about him,” said Aparna.
The officer didn’t have any firearms, but then again what fun would they be? He was all smiles as he waltz towards them. “I told you children it was not a good idea to come into the forest. Now I’ll have to show you why.”
Gatril stood before Kiran, bearing her teeth. “Kiran, get back and use that spell of yours. Aparna, can you fight?”
Aparna took off her cloak and took out her revolver and knife. “I wouldn’t have been here if I couldn’t.”
Kiran kept his focus and channeled his spirit energy into his staff. “Popobawa!” he said. “I came here only for your queex. If you can masturbate and give it to me, I can give you anything else in return but us!”
“Oh, boy, but I do want you all,” he said. The man’s body suddenly gave off a dark mist and broke apart, recombining into a lanky figure with gruesomely sharp claws on its hands and feet, and dark hair swaying off her head with the texture of bristles.
The shape was undeniably feminine; a small waist with wide hips, and ample breasts. Her face had a single red eye glaring at them like hot coal, above a half-open mouth filled with sharp teeth. Her ears were pointy, her skin of a reddish hue, and striking, membranous black wings sprouted out of her back like the cursed sails of an old, lost ship.
Kiran clenched his ass cheeks. “Yeeek!”
“I’ll drink your blood and screw you all!” the popobawa said, and her clitoris abruptly swelled until it resembled a throbbing phallus.
“Attack!” said Gatril, lunging at the popobawa.
She leapt over the bosdrake and struck her in the back with her foot. Gatril winced and fell, but got up and leaped at her once more. The popobawa attacked but Gatril slammed her tail into the popobawa’s thigh.
The bat-creature yelled and took to the sky with a flap of her wings, cackling dreadfully as she zipped through the air. The popobawa dove at them with the intended vice-grip of her talons, forcing the trio into a frantic duck-for-cover scenario.
Gatril and Aparna tried to counter with acid and gunfire, but the popobawa was too fast for their attacks.
The flying attacker came after Kiran, and the boy ducked and fell. He still clung to his staff, pulling water from the air into a huge ball that had already grown as big as himself.
“Everyone!” said Gatril. “I’ll use my stun-fog! Cover your noses!”
Gatril predicted the popobawa had become quite comfortable in her swooping technique, and if she could just execute it when the popobawa was in her descent, it would affix her into a dive right into Gatril’s attack.
But the popobawa struck first, vomiting a dark smog. She flew in a circle around them to completely shroud them in the black smoke.
Aparna fanned the substance from her face and pulled her blouse over her nose. She turned to Kiran, but his form immediately became obscured. “Kiran!”
“Gatril? Aparna?” Kiran called to his friends, but could only hear them. He could vaguely make out the massive sphere of water before him. 
Almost ready, he thought.
Not even Gatril’s feral eyes could penetrate the darkness, yet alone that of the humans. But the popobawa’s single eye was specifically designed for such a task, able to clearly discern their body temperature and shape.
And Kiran was the perfect option for the popobawa. The popobawa snatched him by his shoulders and hoisted him into the air.
“Uhh! Help! Let go of me!” Kiran kicked but his thrashing was piddly compared to the strength of the popobawa.
“Don’t worry!” the popobawa said. “You’ll be screaming a whole lot when I bust open that ass of yours.”
Below, Kiran could see the smoke clearing, and the flames continuing to spread. No! Kiran thought. I got everyone into this mess! I should be able to save myself!
Kiran felt his spirit energy depleting, but the water he gathered was enough. He launched the liquid sphere over his head and it shuddered, bulged and popped. 
Water fell in huge droplets with the force of stones. They splattered upon the popobawa, continuously pushing her down and hitting against her wings—just as Kiran had planned earlier.
The popobawa swore and snarled. “Blast! You damn boy!”
Kiran clutched the staff and wailed upon her repeatedly. “Let go of me!” he said.
When the smoke cleared, Gatril saw the two in the air struggling. “Shit…” She tried to come up with a plan and turned to Aparna for assistance. 
However, the young woman seemed to have been a step ahead of her.
Resting her shooting arm on her other for support, Aparna used the last light of the vanquishing flames to aid her sight as she aimed at the popobawa. Once she had him in her sights, she smiled. “One point for me,” she said
Aparna fired. 
The muzzle flashed. 
The bullet found its mark, and the popobawa screamed, releasing Kiran. They both plummeted, and the women below screamed in despair.
But Kiran wouldn’t have it. His death wouldn’t be here. 
The young sorcerer reached out and grabbed the popobawa by the arm and pulled her close. Channeling the last of his spirit energy into his staff, Kiran used the force-counter spell to propel them across the sky. The blast was enough to change their trajectory and decrease their momentum. 
They hit the ground from seven meters up, and Kiran’s vision suddenly went dark.

Kiran woke the next morning to find himself the dimly lit confines of Gatril’s nest. His eyes were instantly met with Aparna sitting next to him, and Gatril along with an olive-skinned woman, her hands bound behind her and a vexed pout on her face.
“Hey…” Kiran said to everyone, his voice feeble. He tried sitting up but electric pain sat him back down. “Ouch…”
“Don’t move around too much,” said Aparna, gently pushing him back down. “You broke a few ribs and your right arm.”
Kiran responded to the news with distress. He looked at his arm and saw it in a sling, and the bandages on his shoulders and leg. “Aww man.” Kiran groaned. Then he suddenly remembered and his eyes came alight. “Wait a minute, where’s the popobawa?”
“Right here,” said Gatril, gently shoving the strange woman. “We threatened to cut off her clit if she didn’t hand over his queex, so she shapeshifted into this woman.”
Kiran stared at the woman once more, concern replaced with intrigue. She had a slim build and perky breasts, and her crotch was covered in thick pubic hair. “Oh, alright.”
“Bastards,” said the popobawa, its voice high pitched to match its female form. “Just hurry already so I can leave.”
“You’re not in the position to be making demands,” said Gatril. “You’re gonna satisfy my friend to the fullest.”
“Are you sure about that, Gatril?” said Aparna. “Kiran can barely move yet alone thrust his hips.”
“Oh, that’s simple,” said Gatril as she stood and removed her bra and loincloth. “I’ll just get the queex from her for him. You can stimulate Kiran while he watches.”
Kiran shot Aparna a startled glance. It seemed outrageous to think this newcomer would be willing to join their special recreational activity. Aparna met Kiran with a contemplative, almost cynical stare, making him retract his neck in embarrassment.
Kiran turned to Gatril and said, “I think Aparna would be more willing to get the queex from her while you do me.”
“That’s fine,” said Aparna. 
“I-It is?” stammered Kiran.
Aparna stood and took off her clothes. “I’ve always wanted to try a Tatanuese man.”
Aparna’s pubic hair was shaved in a “V” pattern. The fresh smell of bitterweed and sweat wafted off into Kiran’s nose, arousing his sense like an intoxicating drug. 
Aparna gently laid next to Kiran and pulled down his underwear, stroking his swelling penis. She kissed him, and brought her chest up to his face where he could see her dark nipples ready and waiting. As Kiran nibbled and sucked on them, his flaccid phallus had swollen into a sturdy pole.
Gatril got a bowl and got behind the popobawa, sitting her down in her lap and spreading open her legs. Kiran multitasked amongst milking Aparna’s nipple, fingering the inside of her warm damp crotch and watching as Gatril placed the jar between the popobawa’s legs, kissing her cheek and neck.
The popobawa felt Gatril’s clawed fingers slide inside her and winced. “Aah! S-Slow down!”
“Quiet,” said Gatril, and locked her lips with hers, swiveling her tongue in her mouth. The bosdrake tweaked the popobawa’s nipple and vigorously fingered her. The popobawa moaned against her will, unwittingly riding the hand inside her with the contractions.
Aparna applied another wet kiss on Kiran’s lips before she knelt over him and slowly crawled back. Her dark, mysterious eyes glinted like black pearls, locking Kiran in an entrancement. She took his penis and nibbled on it. Kiran bit his lips and twisted his nose. Aparna licked his shaft from the base to the tip. Then she engulfed it.
Kiran had thought the inside of a woman’s vagina was spectacular, but Aparna was proving him silly for ever having considered such a thing. 
As Aparna vibrated her tongue on the tip of Kiran’s penis, her lips applied suction that almost pulled the blood out of him, bobbing her head with the force of a engine’s piston. Kiran clenched his teeth and clutched the leaves on the floor, resisting the urge to scream. Across from him Gatril unleashed upon the popobawa a cataclysmic sensation as well that had her making muffled screams. Spit and froth fell from between her and Gatril’s lips, as did Aparna’s mouth as she vacuumed the energy from Kiran.
Kiran unleashed a mighty roar, as he did his semen slapped into the back of Aparna’s mouth. The popobawa screamed. Her body quaked, and like a busted pipe her queex sprayed on the floor and inside the bowl.
Gatril took her tongue out of the popobawa’s mouth and allowed the woman to catch her breath. Gatril pushed her aside and took up the bowl. While she brought it over to a jar, Aparna approached the popobawa on the ground and took her by the head. Aparna’s lips were tight, and she pried open the popobawa’s mouth. She was too weak to resist as Aparna slowly opened her lips, and the semen plopped onto her tongue.
“Now be a good girl and swallow,” Aparna said.
The popobawa reluctantly ingested the semen, grimacing. “That was disgusting.”
Aparna patted her head and kissed her. “That’s karma for you.” She laid the woman onto her back and stooped over her face. “Now, time for round two.”
“That’s right,” said Gatril, also with her bottom over Kiran’s face. “Time for you two to make us feel good.”
“At least my tongue isn’t injured,” said Kiran, giggling along with the other women. The popobawa, though frustrated with its defeat, was at least pleased to know a cock wouldn’t be penetrating her, and as Aparna and Gatril sat, both her and Kiran leisurely began eating out the snatch of the women.
Kiran and the popobawa were experts in their own right, able to maintain a rigid flexibility to their tongues while the women bounced on their faces. Aparna and Gatril increased their pace as they made sensuous moans. Aparna was first to reach her climax, then Gatril.
The popobawa licked the scented liquid off her face, savoring the taste. “You Gabanyese women are spicy.”
Aparna saw a tiny smile on the popobawa’s face. “Thanks for the compliment,” she said.
Getting up, Gatril said, “Sounds like someone’s enjoying themselves. In that case…” Gatril gestured for Aparna to get off the popobawa, and the bosdrake cut her restraints with a claw. She helped her to her feet and motioned to Kiran. “Why don’t you finish things off for us.”
The popobawa saw Kiran looking at her expectantly, stroking his still rigid cock with one hand. He smiled at her. She made a frown, but Kiran could tell it was forced. “Why don’t you come over here and…have a seat.”
The popobawa smirked. “None of you tell anyone about this.”
“My lips are sealed,” said Gatril. She turned and kissed Aparna—stuck her fingers inside her. “Let’s cuddle.”
The popobawa crawled over Kiran. She kissed him on his lips, his chin, his neck. With one hand she steadied his penis and slowly sat on it. She moaned softly at the pressure against her insides at the size that filled her. “…Boy…you have a gift it seems.”
