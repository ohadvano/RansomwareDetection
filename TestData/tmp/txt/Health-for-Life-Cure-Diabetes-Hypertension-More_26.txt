mercury poisoning because of the difficulties of it. It has different faces. One (patient) has

headaches, one has tiredness, one has this, one has that. It's a very difficult diagnosis to

make especial y when it's micro-mercurialism in very smal amounts." Dr. Zamm Is an

al ergist and dermatologist and has reported hundreds of cases of patients who have

recovered from a variety of diseases after having their fil ings removed.



Dentists have double the number of brain tumors....



A study at Temple University, Philadelphia, showed that dentists....who work with

mercury fil ings al day long....have overwhelming evidence of mercury poisoning in the

form of high concentrations in the pituitary glands. The study also showed they had

double the number of brain tumors.

â€¢ Jack Levinson, president of the British Dental Society for Clinical Nutrition,

compiled studies showing that female dentists and personnel are 3 1/2 times more

likely to suffer sterility, stil -births, and miscarriages.

â€¢ Mercury linked to Multiple Sclerosis... The Journal of Epidemiology and

Community Health (Vol. 32, no. 155, 1978) and the Swedish Journal of Biological

Medicine (January 1989) have both shown an association between high mercury

levels and multiple sclerosis (MS). In the latter study, the mercury levels in MS

patients were on the average 7.5 times higher than in the control group- - those

without the disease.

â€¢ Mercury fillings weaken the immune system.... Mercury from amalgam fil ings

appears to lower T-lymphocyte cel s, which are among the most important

components of our Immune system. What's more, studies show that with removal

of mercury fil ings, T-cel levels increase dramatical y...and the patient's immune

system returns to normal. Dr. Hal Muggins, at the University of Colorado, has

measured T-cel rises of 100 percent to 300 percent after fil ings were removed.

REMOVAL OF MERCURY FILLINGS SHOWS DRAMATIC HEALTH

IMPROVEMENT



This study gives support that mercury from dental amalgams may be causing health

problems and could be one of the world's greatest health hazards. Most of the 133 health

symptoms mentioned In the study have been associated with mercury poisoning.

Approximately 69% of these symptoms were Improved or eliminated after amalgam

removal.

Mercury is known to affect most enzyme reactions as wel as the immune system

so it is easy to explain physiological y why most of these health problems can occur.

Studies have shown that mercury vapors cross the blood brain barrier. Perhaps this can

account for the high number of mental and emotional problems that seem to improve after

amalgam removal.

An earlier study compared the health status of a group of col ege students without

silver-mercury fil ings to a group with. The group with amalgams had a history of 45%

more health symptoms than the group without. Almost every aspect of health was affected

with a predominance of mental and emotional symptoms which are typical y associated

with mercury toxicity.

The present study has shown that people's mental and physical health does

improve after amalgam removal, with 80% of the subjects feeling better after the mercury

was removed from the mouth.



REMOVAL OF MERCURY AMALGAM



Take 5-10 charcoal tablets half an hour before any dental treatment involving

amalgam removal. The fil ings should be removed in the right sequence: that Is, taking out

the most negatively charged ones first, in sequential order from highest negatively

charged to least.

The readings are done with an Amalgameter. A copper metal ground is placed

between the cheek and teeth, and the tester touches; the probe to each one of the fil ings

or restorations. The Amalgameter wil register a reading with either positive or negative in

microamps. These readings are recorded on a numbered Tooth Chart for/by the dentist.

Upon completion, the readings from each quarter or quadrant of the mouth are added and

the totals reflected on the Chart. Positive and negative readings are kept separately.



WHAT DO YOU REPLACE THE AMALGAM WITH?



3,000 of the country's 180,000 dentists have already switched to using gold, a

mixture of plastic and quartz, or porcelain. Dr. Solomon Cohen, an Atlanta dentist, has not

fil ed any of his patients' teeth with mercury fil ings since 1982. (If you use gold make sure

it is real y gold as I've found out that nickel and beryllium, both toxic, are often mixed with

gold).

ANEMIA - LOW IRON





Iron deficiency or anemia is a serious health problem. What is anemia? What are

some of the symptoms and causes; and how can one improve an iron deficiency? Anemia

is a condition in which there is a reduction in the number of circulating red blood cel s. It

exists when hemoglobin content is less than that required to provide the oxygen demands

of the body. Because iron is essential to hemoglobin formation, it is essential to life.

Hemoglobin is the iron containing pigment of the red blood cel s cal ed heme, and a

simple protein, globin.

About 60% to 70% of the iron found in the body is in the bloodstream; and 30% to

35% is found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Iron is absorbed from the food in the

smal intestine, then it passes in the blood to the bone marrow, and here it is used in

making hemoglobin, which is incorporated into red corpuscles. A corpuscle, after

circulating in the blood for approximately 120 days, dies, and its iron is used over again.

Every second, over 3 mil ion of our red blood cel s die.

The hemoglobin in the blood averages 12 to 16 gm/100 ml. of blood in adult

females, 14 to 18 in males, and somewhat less in children. Studies have shown that

vegetarians normal y have a lower hemoglobin. I believe that the ideal for women should

be 10.5 to 12.5, and no higher than 14 for men.

Some of the major symptoms of anemia are fatigue, paleness of the skin,

headaches, dizziness, ringing in the ears, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, skin

sensations, and poor appetite.

Low iron levels have been shown to impair the immune system (Journal of

Pediatrics 75:86: 899-902). Fungal infections of both the mouth and vagina are quite

common in patients with iron deficiencies (Journal of Infectious Disease 75: 131 (1): 44-

50). A two year study out of Washington, D.C. showed that patients who developed

prostate cancer consumed significantly lower amounts of iron (Nutr. Cancer 87; 9:123-

128).

We also know that inadequate iron levels during pregnancy can have disastrous

effects on the child. This problem can easily be avoided by making sure that an expectant

mother going into a pregnancy is not anemic, and by seeing to it that she includes plenty

of iron-rich foods in her diet.

Heart palpitations (where the heart beat races momentarily) are often iron

deficiency related. When tissues throughout the body don't get enough oxygen, the heart

is forced to pump harder and faster to compensate.

Most Americans have anemia from decreased blood cel formation due to a lack of iron in

their diet. Because of al the refined foods they eat, they have a nutritional deficiency of
