Meanwhile, also near the Temple in Jerusalem, several Rabbis are arguing among themselves about the two witnesses. Rabbi Shulman from Jericho argues that these two are indeed the Moses and Elijah of old. He says to the others "The events of the past three years have opened my eyes to the reality that we Jews missed our Messiah. We were blind to the prophecies  from our writings, but finally I can see them clearly.  This Temple is spiritually bankrupt and is selling out to a worldwide satanic religion headed by the evil Antichrist dictator. The Jews in Israel who were believers before the Midpoint departed for the mountains, as the Scriptures required.  Now only a remnant of Jewish believers remain in Israel, mainly those of us who did not see the Truth until after they had departed. This Temple is a place of false religion, first apostate Judaism, and now the False Prophet has set up the statue of the Antichrist right here. Look at it! It is a lie! It represents the worldwide satanic religion. The New Testament reveals that many Jews will become believers in Jesus Christ as the spiritual blindness of Israel will be lifted as a result of both the Rapture and the ensuing events which unfold.  It also says that at the exact midpoint of the Tribulation a statue of the Antichrist will be placed in the Temple in Jerusalem as part of this worldwide false religious system headed by the Antichrist, who will be worshiped as a god. Then the two witnesses will evangelize and teach despite the temple's use to promote both apostate Judaism and the satanic false religion of the Tribulation. Open your eyes and see the truth! We are now in that time period which Jesus Christ referred to as a “Great Tribulation.”  He will return soon, but not before things get much worse."
Others Rabbis argue with him and accuse him of being a traitor to Judaism. Several tear their clothing as they renounce him. But others stay to discuss the issues with him, as they have also been wondering if they were on the wrong track.
Many Jews are slowly realizing that a new holocaust against the Jews has been occurring, and it is growing every day.  Jewish businesses in Western Europe are being fire-bombed, reminiscent of the mid-20th Century era.  In Russia, Jews are being rounded up and thrown into prison for no reason except for being Jews.  Throughout the Western Alliance Jews have become the new underclass of citizens, scorned and treated as traitors to President Antivon, regardless of being believers in Christ or not.  In every corner of the world Jews are reviled, threatened, incarcerated, tortured, and killed.  All simply for being Jews.  This would ultimately become the worst holocaust in human history.
CHAPTER 20
Trumpet #2

It has been four months since the widespread destruction of vegetation by the first Trumpet Judgment. The world is in a state of starvation and global depression. Misery has increased exponentially and the world is in chaos. Life is at subsistence levels.
Jill Steiner goes on with the daily news. She knows there are many more disasters and much more suffering to come. Things will get far worse, if that can even be imagined.
Before she begins her daily news show, Producer Jack Ford tells her "Jill, your news is now the number one news show in the world for reporting on the disasters. Can you believe that?" Jill replies "I knew a lot of people were watching, but number one in the entire world? I had no idea." Jill thinks it odd that she has become the one person the world turns to for disaster coverage, and her coverage was being sent to news rooms internationally. And people who saw breaking disaster news from around the world would send their video to LANX news just to have Jill air it first.
Just as her daily broadcast begins, a report comes into the news room sent from a commercial airplane pilot over the Pacific. The pilot reported seeing a blazing mountain of fire crash into the Pacific Ocean, and the resulting splash was about 300 miles wide. The report said the ocean immediately turned a sickly red as a concentric tsunami unlike any ever seen went out in all directions. The pilot added that the tsunami wave was "enormous" and "it will be a killer." Video from another airplane arrives within minutes showing a red fireball the size of a mountain coming out of the sky and landing in the Pacific Ocean an estimated 750 miles west of Hawaii. Jill sees it when the rest of her audience sees it. It is a sight which the world has never seen.
Producer Jack Ford hurries to find any live video feed, which he knew would be coming in shortly. As several videos arrive at the news room, he decides to put up a live video feed from Hawaii. Jack sends it straight to the on-air news feed as Jill is in mid-sentence reading reports coming in from other airline pilots.
Local Hawaiian HWTV News reporter Oko Nogomi was reporting on severe beach erosion on the western shore of Oahu when the fireball came into view of his camera.  At that point Oko shifted to live reporting about the fireball he had seen approximately 750 miles west of Oahu. Oko first replays the video of the mountain of fire, then relays to the world what he is seeing  as it is happening: "The fireball suddenly appeared in the western sky, and was not seen until it was relatively close to the earth.  You would think it could have been seen coming from space, but that was not the case.  I would have seen that.  When it appeared it was the shape of an inverted mountain, like a huge cone of bright red fire about the height of Mauna Loa, our largest Hawaiian mountain.  Due to the curvature of the earth I could not see the splash but it had to be gigantic.  But we did feel the earth move as it hit, and it caused smoke to rise out of several local volcanoes, including some dormant ones here on Oahu.  The resulting noise broke the sound barrier even this far away, and that sound took probably an hour to reach us. The energy is unbelievable.  I just looked up the speed of sound vs the speed of a tsunami, and sound travels 750 MPH while a tsunami can reach up to 500 MPH.  That means...let me calculate....that the tsunami should reach us in about 15 minutes."  After several minutes of reporting, Oko's cameraman points his camera to the west as he motions to Oko to look out to sea.  Oko turns to see what the world is seeing through the camera, a tsunami over 300 feet tall.  Oko returns to reporting: "As you can see, the tsunami is almost here.  It will surely swamp the entire island chain.  So this is the end of our little paradise.  If my wife and kids are watching, I love you.  This is Oko Nogomi, HWTV news, reporting...."  Oko turns to face the tsunami just as it reaches shore.  The video feed goes dark as the giant wave crashes over Oahu.
Jill continues to stare at the blank video feed for several seconds. Producer Jack Ford puts up another video which had just come in from a ship out on the Pacific closer to Japan. The Captain of a supertanker is seen yelling into his video that a 300 foot wave is headed straight for his ship. Within a few seconds the huge wave is seen coming over his vessel as the video feed is lost.
Jack Ford then airs the last video report from the Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii as the tsunami races across Maui, wiping out that monitoring location. Jill says to her producer "Enough video, Jack -- let's just read the reports." Jill covers the facts as best she can. But the videos told the story. Within 30 minutes reports come in saying the Hawaiian Islands had been swamped by a giant red tsunami. It is a certainty that all on the islands are lost. Aerial footage soon arrives confirming that there are no remaining buildings on any of the Hawaiian Islands. An aircraft carrier and numerous other Navy ships from Pearl Harbor are seen resting on their side or upside down where Honolulu used to be.
Within the next several hours reports of over 2500 large ships being lost at sea in the Pacific are received.  Many more were destroyed while docked in ports.  Hundreds of Pacific islands have been destroyed, including most of Micronesia and Polynesia.  Japan, Taiwan, New Guinea, the Philippines, and northeastern Australia were hit hard along their coastal cities, even though the tsunami height had decreased somewhat by the time it reached those locations.  The casualties are estimated to be over 75 million people.
Several days later Jill is reporting the follow-up from the burning red mountain: "News of the oceans and seas turning red is not nearly the worst issue here. The more significant issue is that nearly all sea life in the Pacific has been killed. That means one-third of all sea life world-wide has died. One third of all fish, whales, shrimp, lobster, krill and so on have died. The rotting of these creatures is already causing a stench which is creeping across the land masses. Island nations such as Japan, Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan and others are hit hardest by the loss of sea creatures. And the loss of so much sea life means less food from the sea. An already starving world is about to have even less food.
Jill reaches for her Bible study notes which she keeps on her desk in the studio. She begins to read to her audience:
"This event was predicted well over 2000 years ago in Revelation Chapter 8:
Revelation 8:8 “The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, 9 a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.”
Jill then tells her viewers: "I have been reading a book called "The Future Times" which was written a long time ago. Oddly, I played the author's online video the day the Rapture, or Vanishment as it has been called, happened. I would suggest it is good reading about what has been happening, and what is yet to come. Let me read some from that book:
"The second Trumpet Judgment is against the oceans and seas (salt water) of the earth. God takes away a large portion of another major food source, which is seafood. A third of all sea life is destroyed. The oceans are polluted with the rotting sea creatures mixed with blood thrown down, once again reminding that this is judgment for killing God's believers. But even the image of a mountain of fire and blood coming down from heaven into the ocean will not change the minds of the hardened unbelieving world.
This second Trumpet Judgment targets the oceans and salt water seas which together cover about 70% of the earth's surface and account for about 96% of the earth's water. There must be no attempt to try to explain these judgments as an accident such as a random meteor or asteroid.  An angel will literally throw a huge burning mass the size of a large mountain into the earth's oceans.  Remember this is divinely caused, literal and real -- not allegory, not symbolic, but real.  Psalm 105:29 says: “He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die.”  A third of the oceans and seas are turned to blood, and all creatures in those affected regions die.  Overall a third of all sea creatures die.  A third of all shipping is destroyed.  This destruction of so much sea life and many ocean-going vessels, on top of the destruction of a third of all vegetation on earth including 100% of grain plants, quickly squeezes the food supply to the brink, and starvation accelerates.  The rotting flesh of sea creatures and blood will create a worldwide stench and will further accelerate diseases.  The earth does not have time to react to one disaster before the next one hits.  The cumulative build-up of disaster upon disaster maximizes the intensity of the suffering.
It is worth comparing what is happening on earth at this time during the Tribulation to what happened when Moses warned the Pharaoh of Egypt to set the people of Israel free from slavery.  Moses warned and warned, then a terrible judgment would occur, but Pharaoh refused to change his mind.  Then the process repeated.  There were 10 plagues against Egypt, and Pharaoh showed a degree of hardness of heart which will now be equaled by unbelievers during the Tribulation.  Also note the correlation of the actual Trumpet Judgments to the judgments against the Pharaoh of Egypt.  The Egyptian judgments included blood, hail and fire, darkness, killing livestock, rotting flesh of wildlife, pain, unusual things falling from the atmosphere, and so on. The judgments are also similar since they caused intense suffering on a grand scale for the Egyptians, but not for the Jews, and in the same way God will take care of His own during the Tribulation. Even though the entire world will suffer hardship, the unbelievers are specifically targeted and the believers are generally delivered even though the times will be extremely difficult for all."
By this time her producer Jack Ford has his head in his hands. Jill just read on-air from a banned book. He knows he will be visited by the "Citizen's Police" soon.
The next morning, right on cue, three Citizen's Police thugs appear at the news room to arrest him and Jill. They are taken into custody and put into the maximum security prison. As she enters her cell she sees that her producer Jack Ford is already there in a nearby cell. Jill sits and wonders what the future holds for her and Jack. Maybe she should be more careful. But maybe this is my mission since I have a voice heard around the world. If I do not use my opportunity, might more people be lost for all eternity? The questions swirl in Jill's head as a small bowl of left-over broccoli stalk soup is brought to her cell as her only meal for the day. "Great" she thinks to herself. "Maybe they intend to starve me in here.”
CHAPTER 21
Trumpet #3

Three months after the red mountain of fire fell into the Pacific Ocean, another huge fireball, this time a white one, falls from the sky. Video from London shows that as it entered the atmosphere it split apart into thousands of pieces which then headed in all directions.
By this time Jill was back at her anchor desk, having been released from prison after her original three accusers had died from a sudden illness which swept through the Citizen's Police Headquarters, and most of the surviving prison guards had fled to forage for food and water. With no one left there to condemn her, she was released. Also, her popularity as a well-known news anchor probably helped. Her Producer Jack Ford had also been released.
So Jack and Jill simply walked out. The metaphor was apparent to the pair. They said to each other, "did you fetch that water? We might need it." After a laugh they thought how rare humor and laughter had become. Just another victim of this period of Tribulation.
Jill begins her return to anchor duties just as news about the white fireball is breaking. Producer Jack Ford looks at Jill and nods in agreement. During his imprisonment he decided that what Jill had been telling her audience was real. The Bible was right after all.  This is truly the Great Tribulation. The Messiah had already come and would soon return. He now believed it. Jill starts out:
"Glad to be back. Let's get straight to the disastrous news you all want to hear about."
Her news show audience now has even more viewers than before her imprisonment. Reports that the Citizen's Police had put her in prison only enhanced her reputation for reporting the facts as she saw them. That seemed odd to Jill since most of her audience did not accept her premise for why this is all happening. But as she has said previously, she looks at the phenomenon as "moths to the flame." They simply cannot help but look at the truth, even if they cannot accept it. So she simply trudges on.
Jill proceeds to cover the news of the white fireball. She described how it had split apart into thousands of pieces, all still quite large. Then the pieces went straight for many of the fresh water streams and rivers across the world, as if they had homing beacons. The result was the poisoning of one-third of the world's remaining fresh water supply.
Producer Jack Ford replays the video in slow motion showing the blazing white fireball as it split apart and sent pieces in all directions. The fact that the pieces landed so perfectly in streams and rivers was amazing to the viewers, so the video was shown over and over again. Video from specific regions showed the pieces landed in the rivers and streams, causing them to foam and roil as they rolled along. Those dependent on these waters died within seconds of drinking from them. This destruction of a large portion of the remaining drinking water supply would be devastating. An already starving and thirsty world was about to experience a new level of misery.
After she described the event, and the details it involved, she begins to read from her book:
Revelation 8:10 “The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water— 11 the name of the star is Wormwood.  A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.”
"The third Trumpet Judgment is against the fresh drinking water of the earth in lakes, rivers and reservoirs.  An angel throws a massive burning ball of bitter tasting poison into the fresh waters of the earth, breaking up and landing in numerous regions, then spreading out from there.  It will be made of a bitter poison compared to the taste of wormwood, although wormwood is not itself a poison.  The poison is unknown to earth and there is no antidote.  The poison will spread out causing 1/3 of all fresh water to be poisoned, resulting in many deaths from both poison and lack of drinking water.  The ball of fire is not an actual star, but looked like one to John.  Again, these are literal, but since they are not naturally occurring events they must be compared to what John knows.  These are divinely caused, literal and real -- not allegory, not symbolic, but  real.  Those who try to drink the tainted water die.  At this point there is very little food and now little drinking water available on the earth.  People are reduced to bare survival levels and extreme misery.  With very little fresh water to drink, the earth's unbelievers are not just starving, they are dehydrating to death. Believers suffer, but God does not neglect His own, so most will survive unless they take the mark of the Beast."
In the ensuing weeks and months the world was reduced to a struggle for food and water. The basest instincts of mankind were unleashed as people would kill for a cup of water, or a half slice of bread.  The world was starving and thirsting to death.  The death toll over the next several months was staggering. Estimates were sketchy, but thought to be well over 500 million. The world was reduced to basic survival. There was no thought of the future. No looking forward to retirement. No wedding plans. No hope for a family. No hope of any type, except for those who trusted God with their lives. Somehow they had food enough to survive. They suffered, but they lived on."
Even though Jill's news is reported all over the globe, she thinks to herself that no one gets the real message. She wonders if there is a better way to relay what is behind the disasters. She thinks of herself as a failure since people are listening, but not accepting the reality of what is going on. She heads home to her apartment after her news show and sits in her chair thinking about how people ignore truth and accept "the lie" so easily.
CHAPTER 22
Trumpet #4

After another couple months of daily reporting of the grim statistics of the daily disasters, and the impact of the previous two judgments, Jill starts another day wondering when the next Trumpet judgment will come. It will be Trumpet #4 which will cause light from the sun, moon and stars to be diminished by one-third. She did not need to wait long. Today was the day.
As Jill was reporting the daily news, Producer Jack Ford told her there was an eerie and sudden darkness outside. Jill could not see it since her studio has no windows, but she stopped in mid-sentence and asked Weatherman Ross Hoffman to come on air and explain what was happening. The camera showed a stunned Ross as he simply said "I don't know what caused it -- give me a couple minutes."
Jill returned to her duties until after a few minutes Weatherman Ross Hoffman appeared again, looking bewildered.  Jill turned to him and simply said "Ross?"  Ross replied "Let's just look at the video from when this happened."  The video from 15 minutes earlier showed the sun shining normally over the LA basin, having risen to about a 45 degree angel by this time of the morning.  Then the video showed the sun dimmed by about 33% -- it just stopped shining at full intensity.  No clouds, no partial eclipse, no other interference discernible, it just dimmed significantly.  It was immediately darker as during a heavily overcast day with dark clouds.  As Ross was reporting the event, Jill chimed in "we just received reports from Asia that the moon and stars also dimmed, and by approximately 33%.  The darkness was discernible and caused people anxiety about the future of the universe.  If the natural lights of the universe dimmed today, what might happen tomorrow?  This was a huge confidence deflater, as if people had much confidence remaining in anything at this point.  But if the universe was waning, and possibly the sun would be lost, there was no hope at all.  Visibly shaken, weatherman Ross Hoffman stumbled for an explanation but had to admit he had no idea what was happening.  But he did say this had never happened in all of human history. Never, ever."
Jill: "Ross, what will this do to the weather?"
Ross: "The coldest climates will become uninhabitable as those areas will soon be far, far colder. For instance, northern Canada, Russia, and most of Greenland will never get above freezing, even in the summer. Winters will be brutal. Food production will decrease dramatically all over the world due to less sunlight, especially farther from the equator. I doubt anyone could grow wheat or corn anywhere north of Texas starting next year."
Jill: "But that eliminates almost all the wheat and corn producing regions in the US."
Ross: "Exactly. It will be devastating, especially on top of the recent destruction of crops this past year."
Jill was already prepared with her Bible study notes. As Ross finished, Jill began to read:
"This was predicted over 2000 years ago.  I will read from Revelation Chapter 8:"
Revelation 8:12 “The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.”
Then as become her custom, she reads from her book:
"The fourth Trumpet Judgment is a supernatural judgment against light on the earth, and the image of it leaves John struggling to explain what it looks like. A third of the sun becomes dark so that it shines less time on the earth. This is something which must be seen to understand, but it will be literal. A third of the moon (beyond just moon phases) becomes dark, and a third of the stars stop shining. People on the earth at this point are just trying to survive, and now will have shortened opportunity to do so due to the increased darkness. This Trumpet Judgment targets both light and warmth for the earth. Sunlight is significantly diminished by reducing the daylight hours by one-third, resulting in freezing many to death and eliminating many types of the few remaining crops which survived the first Trumpet Judgment. With the other judgments having taken away so many basic necessities there will be an increased reliance on natural light. But the reduction in moonlight by one-third and fewer stars makes nighttime activity more difficult, so the time available to accomplish basic survival actions is further restricted. This means there will be even more hardship when trying to deal with all the accumulating disasters. Again, divinely caused, literal and real -- not allegory, not symbolic, but real. This is not some gradual climate change or man-caused issue; it is divinely caused, sudden, and catastrophic in its effects."
As Jill ends her reading, she looks into the camera and says "Friends, what will it take to convince you that the Bible predicted all that has happened in the past several years? And if it has been correct about these things, then isn't the Bible the real source of Truth for the world?" This time producer Jack Ford smiles as Jill boldly tells her audience what she believes. Both of them have now lost their fear of the Citizen's Police, which is in disarray at this point, and most members had died in gruesome ways.
Jill ends her daily news show and departs for her apartment.  She begins to read about Noah and how he built the Ark to save the human race and also animal life.  She notes the parallels to the current period.  The world was hardened against the Truth in Noah's day, and the current population of the world mirrors that hardness of soul.  She thinks how Noah evangelized the world for 120 years while building the Ark, and his only converts were his own family members.  Seven people, in addition to himself, were believers.  The rest of the world rejected the Truth, and died in the Great Flood.  She wonders if her witness to the current world was having any more impact than Noah.  But then she thinks of Jack Ford, and is encouraged by his recent change of view.  Then there is a knock at her door.
Jill instinctively thinks the worst. It must be the Citizen's Police. Who else could it be? The knock repeats. Jill asks through the door: "Who is it?" The answer surprises her. "It's Adam, your brother." Jill had not seen or heard from Adam in three years. The last words between them were not very nice.
Adam: "Jill, I am here to say I am sorry...if you will let me."
Jill opens the door and motions him in. She senses a change in him. He is not like when she last saw him. Jill asks "You OK?"
Adam: "Yes.  Much better than when I last saw you.  And I am sorry for all of that	it was my fault and I just wanted to let you know that, and...well	I have been watching your news show every day lately. You have changed my mind about what I believe, which was not very much about anything before. But now I see that we missed our Messiah. I am now a believer."
"That's wonderful!" Jill said, so happy to hear her own brother had changed his mind, and also because of her message to her viewers. She thinks that is at least two people she has helped see the Truth, her news Producer Jack Ford and now her brother. The two talked for a while and then Adam said he would come see her again tomorrow at the studio. Maybe he could help out or be useful somehow.
As Adam left, Jill had a sense that she was not the failure she had thought she had been, and that her news show served a purpose. A real purpose.
CHAPTER 23
JEWS IN HIDING BECOME RESTLESS

In the mountains east of Israel the leaders of the Jews who fled during the Midpoint are gathered for their weekly council meeting. They had been hiding in the mountains for over two years now, and it was wearing on the people in the camp. The people were becoming restless. Many began to wonder about why they were there. Some began to stir up the camp with talk of going back to rescue their fellow Jews who were suffering intensely. Others simply did not like being cooped up in one place.
Josh Simmons begins the council meeting of the twelve Camp Leaders by saying: "Discontent is growing among our people here in the camps. They have heard all the reasons why we are here, but they do not fully understand their purpose. Some are stirring up the people to break from the group and form their own council, and possibly even leave the camp and go back to Israel. We must encourage the people, and also be steadfast in our resolve to keep good order in the camp. We do not want a repeat of the incident from a year ago when many set out for Jerusalem and were killed." The council discusses how they might keep the people from losing focus, and avoid discontentment that might lead to groups breaking off and going out on their own. But there is not agreement among all council members. Some even expressed sympathy for those who were discussing departing the camp, or possibly going back to Jerusalem to help their fellow Jews.
Josh continues: "The Tribulation is entering its final phase, which is characterized by a period of "the Woes," which are judgments by torturing demons who will inflict great pain and later death on the world's populace. But we here in the camps are protected from the Woes as long as we remain faithful, mainly by staying where we are, and by refusing the Mark of the Beast."
Josh continues "The first four Trumpet Judgments targeted nature, and therefore mankind indirectly, especially unbelieving mankind. Billions have been killed while the rest are starving, thirsty, freezing, diseased and mostly in the dark on a stinking, rotting, ugly planet. Misery would seem to be at a peak, but it will get much worse. And what happens during the remaining three judgments will be something the masses of unbelievers are not expecting. In fact, the next Trumpet Judgments are called “Woes” for a very good reason. Misery will now be taken to new heights. They are described in Revelation After Josh had finished one member of the council objected. Noam Givan had not been happy with the leadership of the other council members, and he spoke for those in the camp who saw things differently. Noam spoke to the council: "How long shall we sit here and let our fellow Jews back in Israel be imprisoned, tortured, and killed at the hands of these evil Goi heathen? We must mount a resistance and go back to help them. We sit here in comfort and have enough food and water while our dear friends back in our homeland are suffering. A number of people in my part of the camp believe we are cowards to sit here and not help our suffering fellow Jews. We must return to Jerusalem and fight with them."
Josh tries to reason with Noam. "We must remain unified and encourage everyone to stay in place as the Bible commands us. To leave the camp is certain death. We have Divine protection here. The enemy knows where we are but they cannot reach us because God has covered us. But if any leave this place, that coverage will not go with them."
Matthew 24 says:
“At that time if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘There he is!’ do not believe it. 24  For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have told you ahead of time. 26  “So if anyone tells you, ‘There he is, out in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. 27  For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.”
Josh Simmons: "The time to depart will be very clear to all. Until then, we are commanded by the Scriptures to remain and wait patiently on the Lord."
Noam Givan simply shakes his head and walks out of the council meeting. Josh and several others stay behind and discuss the issue further. Another member of the Council speaks up to support what Josh has said:
"Satan will continue to try to lure us out into the open to be killed.  If we remain in the mountains we will be safe under a supernatural hiding.  But if any come out they will be killed. We must survive to populate the Millennium, and we only need to wait another 18 months, which will be 3 ½ years from the time of our flight to these mountains.  We believers will be very tempted to come out of hiding to help our fellow Jewish believers still in Israel since they will be under attack and in great distress.  But any such intended heroism would be  misplaced, since we would never get the chance to help, but would instead be killed as soon as any come out from hiding.  Sometimes hiding is the heroic act, if that is what God requires.
God has a plan, and it must be followed precisely during these difficult times. Some must flee and wait, others must persevere and fight. Misplaced heroism will not be rewarded. We must remain until the Second Advent has occurred, and it will not be possible to miss that event."
The members depart for their sections of the encampments. But they know this is not the end of the issue. Patience is in short supply in the camps.
The following day a large crowd of Jews are gathered around Noam Givan as he speaks. He talks of the suffering of their fellow Jews back in Israel, and how staying in the camp is cowardly. The crowd becomes worked up and is ready to accept his message. They want to be patriots.  They want to return and fight.  As Noam finishes his speech he yells "I am going back to fight the enemy -- who is with me?" Cheers go up from the crowd as many shout their support for mounting a guerrilla action against the enemy in order to help their countrymen. They are ready to return and fight.
Josh Simmons had been listening from a short distance away. He knew that Noam would stir up trouble. Josh jumps up onto the stage and shouts "Silence! Silence! Listen to me!" The crowd shouts boos and jeers at Josh, but he continues" "Good people of Israel, we are here because it is the Lord's will that we must serve as a remnant of believers to populate the Millennial Kingdom. The Bible says that if any leave this place of hiding and divine protection they will certainly be killed. Their lives will be forfeited for no purpose. We must remain here as the Bible commands. We are not cowards to obey the Word of Truth. We must obey or perish. Anyone who leaves will be killed by the forces of evil and for no purpose at all. If you think us to be cowards, then you think the Word of the Lord is nothing. The command to us is very clear. Remain and wait patiently. We are being tested for our patience, and it is hard for all of us. To leave is a useless death. This is your final warning. No one can leave here until the Lord Himself returns, and it will not be long. He will provide for our fellow Jewish believers who are in Israel. He does not want or need your help. Choose wisely."
Many of the Jews calm down and accept that Josh has made a point. But others refuse to accept his guidance. Noam Givan recruits any who will join him to go back and help the Jews in Israel who are suffering and dying in large numbers. They set a date for departure.
Meanwhile, they train for their mission. They believe their mission will receive the Lord's blessing since they are seeking to help their fellow Jews in distress. They see themselves as patriots.
Within a month the departure date arrives. Noam and his group seem well trained and committed to fulfill their goal of helping their distressed fellow Jews.  They depart after sunset, with the goal of reaching Jerusalem by dawn. All goes well as they make their way down the mountains and across the Jordan River. As they approach Jerusalem, things go very badly.
The forces of the Antichrist are waiting for them. Surveillance systems picked up their departure from the enclave as soon as they had departed. They were tracked all the way down the mountains and across the Jordan River.
The Antichrist forces are entrenched along a road just east of Jerusalem. As the Jewish contingent made their way down the road, the leader of the Antichrist forces gives the order to open fire. A massive arsenal is unleashed on the band of Jews. Within two minutes all are dead.
Word of the disastrous defeat reaches the Jews back in Petra. Josh simply relays the news without comment. It is a hard lesson to the remaining Jews that they must remain in hiding, or face certain death for no reason.
CHAPTER 24
JUDGMENTS TURN DEMONIC -- TRUMPET #5 / WOE #1

The following day Jill brings Professor Heathrow back to her studio to interview. This time it is about the disasters turning from natural disasters to demonic ones. Jill wants to get an expert opinion on this issue, and the Professor has been spot-on in his previous explanations on her show.
Jill: "Professor Heathrow, we are almost five years into this period of Tribulation, and we have seen numerous horrific disasters of all types. What can you tell us about the changes which are about to occur regarding the type of disasters the Bible indicates will be seen over the next couple years?"
Professor Heathrow: "During the initial several years after the Rapture there was a significant increase in man-made and natural disasters. Then after the Midpoint the first four Trumpet Judgments involved disruption of natural processes such as food production, drinking water supplies, weather, volcanoes, sunlight and many other such issues. Now the Trumpets will change course and become demon attacks allowed by God on the unbelievers of the earth. As if the first four Trumpet Judgments had not been severe enough, God will now allow criminal demons which have been imprisoned for thousands of years to be released to create havoc on the earth, as they torture unbelieving mankind. Starting with the 5th Trumpet, the next three Trumpet Judgments are called “Woes” due to the extremity of direct suffering associated with them. And the emphasis is on the word "direct." Barely surviving the famines and disease caused by the first four Trumpet Judgments is one thing, especially since that suffering was indirectly caused. But now severe pain from demon torture is about to be added, and it will be direct attacks on individuals. Then with the 6th Trumpet it will turn to direct attacks by demons on individuals resulting in death. It will be brutal."
Jill: "Professor, there have been sightings, mostly in the Middle East, of what people have called "the Swarm." Is this related to these next Trumpets?"
Professor Heathrow:  "Definitely.  "The Swarm" as some have called it is demon activity.  It came up from the giant plume of black smoke just after the Midpoint, and the Bible says they came out of the Abyss where they had been imprisoned.  So far there have been demonstrations of power by those demons, as seen by them swarming to intimidate certain populations and groups, such as when the Jews were fleeing Israel for safety in the mountains.  But now the earth is about to see what "the Swarm" was sent to accomplish.  God allowed these criminal demons to be released after having been in middle-earth prisons for thousands of years.  The initial part of the Swarm was released when Satan was cast down to the earth at the Midpoint, but they have not been allowed to attack humans yet.  And another group of hard-core criminal demons have not yet been released.  They will be released later. As Revelation 9:1 says:
“The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss. 2 When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss. 3 And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth. 4  They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 5 They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes.”
"The “star” is Satan (Isaiah 14:12; Ezekiel 28:16) who was banished to earth at the Midpoint along with many of his demons, who were the initial Swarm.  Satan knows the end is very near for him.  He has read the Bible.  All he has left in his bag of tricks are chaos and destruction.
He must try to find a way to try to wiggle out of his certain fate. So now he will release another large group of criminal demons, many millions, who will first torture and then kill people. But only unbelievers, and those believers who took the Mark of the Beast."
Jill: "You call these "criminal demons." Why?"
"Before Satan was confined to earth at the Midpoint, he was given the keys to unlock the Abyss, a middle-earth jail where millions of criminal demons have been imprisoned for thousands of years, put there long before man was created. These criminal demons were involved in Satan's rebellion against God, and were punished by a long jail sentence. The final three Trumpet Judgments or “Woes” will involve these demon criminals who are about to be released onto the earth where they will create chaos and torture and eventually kill unbelieving mankind. Even Satan will not be able to control them, as he was not able to control them in the ancient past. It should be noted that demons have personalities and areas of extreme action just like humans. The demons released during the Tribulation are pure criminals, and they will enjoy the torture they inflict on humans."
"To be clear, before the Tribulation God had very strict rules for Satan and demons to operate under, so they had to generally behave and leave people alone, although they sometimes possessed the bodies of unbelievers who enabled it. But during the Tribulation the rules change to allow more extreme demon activities. Two of the significant changes are that demons can physically attack people, and the other is that some of these particular demons (but not all) will be visible to humans."
Jill: "How will this happen? What will it look like to humans?"
Professor Heathrow: "Satan has unlocked the Abyss and release his demon criminal armies who have been imprisoned for thousands of years in chains of smoke and darkness. This fifth Trumpet Judgment releases additional multitudes of torturing demons which Revelation describes as looking like locusts and having stingers like a scorpion. Being criminals they know how to torture people, and they will do it very well and with great enthusiasm. They have the ability to strike quickly and unexpectedly from the sky just as locusts can maneuver from place to place. People will not know when to expect them, so will live in constant fear.
This stinging demon torture will last for five months, one of the few references to timing of these Trumpet judgments. Again, this is rather late in the second half of the Tribulation, during the time of the Great Tribulation. In fact, the “Woes” judgments almost define the term “Great Tribulation.”
Jill: "And what does the Bible say the reason for this is?"
Professor Heathrow:  "It is because of the holocaust against the Jewish believers during the Tribulation.  The unbelievers have killed many of the 144,000 witnesses and countless other Jewish believers.  Now they will pay for this holocaust.”
CHAPTER 25
THE SWARM ATTACKS

In towns and cities across Europe people are going about their daily business, generally trying to find enough food and water for their family to survive. For most families this has become a daily task which requires many hours of effort. It involves going from store to store, standing in line to get whatever there is for sale that day, then moving on to another store to repeat.
People seldom get what they want. The best they can hope for is to arrive home after a long day of searching, feed their family enough to survive another day, and then repeat the next day. Life has become repetitive, boring, tedious, and miserable. There is no more leisure time, not like before the Vanishment. There is no hope for a better future. Even the sun is going out, many believe, so forget climate warming because it is freezing cold in most of Europe during the summer now. Suicide rates are very high, and it has become the second leading cause of death after starvation. Most people are going through their lives like the walking dead. They are starving, thirsty, bitter and without hope.
On a street in Lisbon, Portugal, a man has just bought half a loaf of bread in a store, now he is headed to another store in hope of finding butter or maybe even some meat, which is very rare. In the distance he sees what looks like a huge flock of birds flying close to the ground.
They are so thick. Then he hears what sounds like a collective scream, but far away. The sound gets closer, and closer. Then he sees them. It is "the Swarm," and they are swooping everywhere randomly attacking nearly everyone as they go along. There are thousands and thousands of them. A rolling wave of screams is going out as the Swarm makes its way toward him. Within seconds he is attacked and stung several times.  His scream joins the thousands of others. The pain is excruciating. No torture ever devised could match it.
Someone in the crowd in Lisbon uploads a video to the LANX website just as the Swarm begins its attack. Jill Steiner is the first to air the coverage. She immediately knows what it is, and what it means.
Jill: "News has just come in of the Swarm attacking citizens in Europe. Roll that video now." The video shows a frightening scene of the "Swarm" appearing suddenly in the skies and pouncing on the helpless population below as it proceeds. It darkens the sky as it approaches. Then it strikes. A rolling wave of collective screams is heard as the first sign it is approaching. When they get closer to the camera, their physical appearance is frightening.
Jill tells her audience: "These are not creatures of this world. These are demons who have come to torture the human race."
Then Jill begins to read from Revelation and also from her book:
Revelation 9:6 “During those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them. 7  The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces. 8  Their hair was like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth. 9 They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. 10 They had tails with stingers, like scorpions, and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months.”
Jill: "Let me also read from my book:"
"The first thing to note is that these demons are visible to humans. This demon criminal group is compared to an army prepared for battle. They travel in swarms and make a horrifying noise which adds to the paralyzing fear they induce among their victims. The look of this demon army is like cavalry riding into battle with helmets, emblems and armor. The individual demons are fierce looking with faces resembling man."
Revelation 9:11 “They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer).”
The demon army is led by the number two demon of all time, Abaddon.  At the Fall of Satan, 1/3 of all angels followed Satan and his top lieutenant Abaddon.  It should be noted this is Satan attacking his own people, since they are attacking mostly unbelievers, and those believers who depart from their faith.  The mantra is “make them suffer!” Evil has no loyalty. This part of the angelic conflict shows Satan as ruler of the earth is incapable of being “like the Most High God” which power he lusted for and caused his original Fall. Satan uses people and spits them out, like any other unfair and ungrateful dictator. And he dared to think of himself as equal to God."
Reports continued to come into the studio showing that the Swarm started in several locations around the world at the same time. In Europe it started in Portugal which is the western-most major city in continental Europe, and spread eastward. Additional Swarms began on all the other continents at the same time. Over the next several weeks the Swarms made their way into all parts of the seven continents, having spread in all directions. Then they randomly went back to where they had previously terrorized their victims and attacked again, so that no one knew where or when they would strike.  There was no place to hide from them.  They could not even be locked out of buildings, so there was no safe place. But believers were unaffected by the stinging demons.
During the next five months Jill covered the effects of the "stinging demons" as they inflicted excruciating pain on their victims all over the earth. They continued to strike randomly when least expected, which made their torture even more intense and it drove fear into the hearts of people everywhere. Since no one knew when or where they would strike next, intense and debilitating fear became part of daily life, along with starvation, thirst, and pain.
After several months of "the swarm" roving the earth, unbelievers everywhere are at the breaking point. They can no longer stand the intense pain of their attacks, the anxiety of not knowing when they would appear next, and the fear of what all of this meant. But they remained hardened in their resolve that God was not the answer for them. Suicides skyrocketed in number.
Jill reports the news of the end of the demon torture: "After five months of torture the attacks have ended. Just as suddenly as "the swarm" had appeared, they just as suddenly departed.
The air is now clear of them. People everywhere are rejoicing that this scourge is finally over. Several months of this torture was nearly unbearable. It has been just over six years since the Vanishment, so we are less than one year from the end of the Tribulation. That end is called Armageddon."
Jill concludes her report on the end of the Swarm by quoting from Revelation 9:12: “The first woe is past; two other woes are yet to come.”
CHAPTER 26
TRUMPET #6 / WOE #2

Within a few weeks the Swarm was back. This time they came prepared to kill. And kill they did. They appeared first in the Middle East, somewhere near the Euphrates River in Iraq.
From there they quickly spread out in all directions. This group moved faster than the first Swarm, which stopped to sting it victims. This Second Swarm plowed through cities and towns and just kept going at a high rate of speed.
Jill covers the story on her daily news broadcast within minutes of the first attacks, having been alerted by eyewitnesses in several countries. The video was frightening to watch, as people were mowed down like grass by these killer demons.
Jill: "After several weeks of absence "the Swarm" has returned, and this time they are lethal. In the previous attacks they inflicted severe pain, but did not kill.  But now they are killing their victims.  Let us look at what the Bible says about what we are seeing happen before our eyes.  Jill reads from Revelation 9:13:
“The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God. 14 It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” 15 And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind.”
Then Jill turns to her book and reads:
"The sixth Trumpet (Second Woe) sets loose another huge demon army imprisoned deep under the Euphrates River led by four demon princes. This second demon army was also put into chains due to an angelic conflict violation in ancient times before man was created. We can see that Satan's armies in ancient times fought a vicious battle against the elect angels loyal to God, even to the point of violating the rules established by God, for which they were imprisoned. They are now released, not only to further torment mankind, but these demons are also allowed to kill 1/3 of remaining unbelieving mankind.  They target unbelievers except for those Satan wants to spare for his own purposes, mainly those who are demon possessed.  Satan will need some  people to be spared for his coming battle to kill the Jews.  Satan believes that if he eliminates the Jews, God would be defeated since God promised the Jews a Millennial Kingdom where Christ will rule over regathered Israel in the land promised to them.  If the Jews are killed off, God could not fulfill His promise.  This is the main reason why the Jews are targeted throughout human history.
Jill once again turns to her favorite Professor for explanations. Professor Heathrow from USC is back in the studio with her.
Jill: "Professor Heathrow, the First Woe was demon torture of people, and now the Second Woe has been unleashed. These demons are now killing people. Would you please explain why this is happening?"
Professor Heathrow: "It is happening because Satan is desperate. He is out of options, and will soon be thrown into prison. His plan has devolved into something like "create enough chaos, death, and destruction and anything is possible." He is trying to prevent being thrown into the Lake of Fire. But he will fail. Regarding the specifics of what is happening, let us take a look at a staggering statistic.
First, the three “Woes” are sequential. The initial Woe, the stinging demons, lasted five months and is now past. The Swarm inflicted its intense pain on the world for five very long months. Now the sixth Trumpet Judgment, which is also called the “Second Woe,” has today been unleashed. There will be a "Third Woe" during the seventh Trumpet Judgment which includes the Second Advent and Armageddon. We can see the timing of these three Woes is very late in the Tribulation. So we have less than a year remaining before the Lord returns and Armageddon becomes a reality."
He continues:  "The Bible reveals the enormous size of this new group of killer demons. Revelation 9:16 says:
“The number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number.”
"Let us do the math.  We see that the number is 2 x 10,000 x 10,000 = 200,000,000.  That is a huge army of demons which cannot be avoided or defended against.  They will roll through cities, nations, and continents like a giant war machine killing unbelievers at will.  But believers will be spared because God will only allow these demons to attack unbelievers.  As Revelation 9:17 says:
“The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this: Their breastplates were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke and sulfur.”
Professor Heathrow continues: "Again we see this demon army is visible to mankind, and looks like a cavalry army prepared and dressed for battle, which is their purpose. The demons travel massed together, spewing poisons from their collective “mouths” as they proceed. The demons are mounted on some type of war machines which have weapons in both front and back. Then we see how many people will be killed, and the numbers are staggering:
Revelation 9:18 “A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths. 19 The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails were like snakes, having heads with which they inflict injury.”
"This means the demons use chemical and biological agents to kill large numbers of unbelievers, which is fully 1/3 of those remaining who survived everything that has happened so far.  The demon war machines spew killing agents from the front, and poison also comes from a snake-like tail whipping back and forth.  Once again, God protects His own and they are spared."
Revelation 9:20 “The rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood—idols that cannot see or hear or walk.”
Jill interjects: "So Professor, the unbelievers will still generally refuse to believe in Jesus Christ for salvation. They become further hardened against God. They prefer to worship Satan's religious systems of empty deities, money, immorality, human power, sorcery, drug addiction, human sacrifice, and resort to violence and general human degeneracy of all forms. The Tribulation forces each person to choose between God and total degeneracy."
Professor Heathrow: "Quite right. As the end nears, only the most hardened unbelievers remain since demon armies will have killed all other unbelievers. The earth is now down to a hard-core set of degenerate unbelievers. That will be when Armageddon comes, which is part of the 7th Trumpet Judgment, which includes the Third Woe, and it will be delayed until the end of the Tribulation. In the meantime, the Bowl Judgments will begin."
Jill: "Thank you Professor Heathrow. You have been so kind to come in for these interviews. I hope to see you again soon."
Producer Jack Ford has been watching for video coming in which would show the Swarm. It did not take long. Video has now come into the studio from a town in eastern Turkey showing the scene of horror. Jack says into Jill's earpiece: "The person sent it directly to you, Jill.
Warn people that it will not be easy to watch."
Jill: "We have a video of an attack by the Swarm which has just taken place a couple minutes ago in Turkey. Beware that my Producer says this video is hard to watch. You have been warned."
The video appears on screen showing the Swarm moving toward a town, turning the sky dark, and closing in quickly. A young woman standing with her friends is filming the event. As the Swarm comes nearer, individual members of the Swarm can be seen in more detail. They are large, multi-colored, and each one has a rider perched on top of some sort of war machine with a large opening on the front and a swishing tail on the back end. A gas is shooting out forcefully from front and back, one color from the front, and another from the back. People below fall down as they pass overhead. Every person. They writhe and scream in agony, but do not die immediately. The Swarm closes in on the young woman, who continues to video the event. She says as they are about to reach her "I hope you get this, Jill!" The video then shows a yellow gas coming at her with great velocity, and then she falls down. Her camera falls from her hand and points toward a group of people who had been standing near her, and it shows them all writhing on the ground and screaming in pain. The video continues for some time, since they do not die right away. It takes several minutes, and then each one goes limp, one by one, until they are all motionless.
Jill: "I had no idea she was going to say my name! Poor girl. She knew we were watching and wanted us to show this to the world." Jill needs a minute to collect herself after the video stops. Producer Jack Ford shows another less gruesome one to give Jill some time.
Then Jill continues: "As you have seen, this Second Swarm, called the Second Woe in the Bible, is another level of judgment on the earth. It will be here in LA before long. It will be everywhere soon. Are you ready for eternity?"
The following day there is more grim video. Too much to deal with. Producer Jack Ford airs some segments to show close-ups of the individual Swarm members. They are fierce and other-worldly looking. But oddly, they appear to be laughing as they go about their hideous task. They seem to be enjoying it. Jack Ford rolls the video back several times in slow motion to confirm. Yes, they are laughing, shouting, and gesturing to each other. But mostly just laughing.
Jill returns to reporting other news while Producer Jack Ford has been putting together the statistics for the death toll so far.  Starting in the Middle East, initial reports show 1/3 of the people in each city or town the Swarm goes through have died.  After just an hour, the death toll is estimated to be over 5 million people.
Jill: "At this rate, the death toll will be over a billion before this is over."
As her broadcast ends for the day, Jill thinks to herself: "Another billion people dead.  That would mean the total death toll during this Tribulation has been 70% of the world's population.  Many billions of people, and it is not nearly over.  We still have many Bowls and Armageddon ahead of us.  We were told this over 2000 years ago, and now it is here."
She thinks about how she missed the Rapture, then says to herself: "I must stop thinking about what I missed. I am here now for a purpose.”
CHAPTER 27
THE BOWL JUDGMENTS

It has been 6 1/2 years since the Vanishment.  Less than six months remain until Armageddon and the return of the Lord.  Although the unbelievers are bearing most of the judgments, the faith of believers is being severely tested.  Only those faithful until the very end of the Tribulation will go into the Millennial Kingdom and live another 1000 years in perfect environment.  The testing has caused some believers to take the Mark of the Beast, and most of them died at the hands of the Swarm demons.  Many believers have acted like unbelievers to hide their faith from the unbelieving world.  And some others refused to obey the specific commands in the Bible which were meant for them, including some believers in Israel who refused to flee at the Midpoint.  Among those who fled to the mountains from Israel, some departed their hiding place and died.  This was not a time for being a casual believer.  There were only two sides, and each person had to choose one side or the other.  There was no middle ground.  Decisions meant life or death.
Back in Israel the remnant of believers who had fled to the mountains east of Israel see that the time of the Lord's return is drawing near. Josh Simmons, the leader of the Jews in exile, talks to the Jews who are gathered about the next series of judgments which are about to commence. Josh speaks to the assembled congregation:
"It is now time for the seven Bowl Judgments to avenge the killing of believers during the Tribulation. These judgments will be the worst seen in all of human history, and lead up to the return of Jesus Christ at the Second Advent. God does not cause misery without a good reason. These Bowls occur very late in the second half of the Tribulation between the 6th and 7th Trumpet Judgments, after God has sent many forms of evangelization to those who are about to be severely judged." Josh reads from his book:
"So far during the Tribulation there have been natural disasters, man-made disasters, and divine judgments revealed by the Seals, including the first six Trumpet Judgments. Now the seven Bowl Judgments will be unleashed on the earth, which occur after the Sixth Trumpet Judgment. God's patience is at an end."
Then Josh reads from Revelation:
Revelation 15:1 “I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with the seven last plagues—last, because with them God’s wrath is completed.”
Revelation 16:7 “And I heard the altar respond: “Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are your judgments.”
"Those in Heaven who have offered prayers to have the deaths of the martyrs avenged acknowledge the perfect Justice of God."
Josh continues, providing encouragement that they are nearing the end of their time in the mountains: "These seven last plagues or Bowl Judgments are executed between the 6th and 7th Trumpet Judgments. Since they are called the “last plagues” they occur very close to the end of the Tribulation. The Trumpet Judgments are executed throughout the period of the Great Tribulation, which is the last 3 ½ years, so the Bowl Judgments fit in very near the end. We have about six months remaining until the Lord returns, then we will depart these mountains and return to our homeland."
At the same time Josh is addressing the Jews in the mountains near Petra, Jill Steiner is in her LA apartment unable to sleep. She knows there is a next round of judgments about to be revealed. She reads from her book so she will know what to expect.
"Upon the command of the Lord the seven Bowl Judgments begin, and the first Bowl causes unbelievers on earth to break out in awful, thick, painful sores in judgment for worshiping the Antichrist and taking the mark of the Beast.  This judgment hearkens back to the Pharaoh of Egypt and the plague of sores in ancient Egypt.  The unbelievers of the Tribulation took the Mark of the Beast, and since they like marks on their skin, God is about to give them pockmarks all over their bodies.  And the pain associated with them will be excruciating.  As Revelation 16:1 says:
“Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go, pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath on the earth.”  2 The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly, festering sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.”
Jill closes her book and thinks about what that means. The current world is about to be judged for how it has treated the believers of the Tribulation, just as the Pharaoh of Egypt was judged 3000 years ago using numerous plagues for refusing to free the Jews from captivity after 400 years of slavery. She goes to sleep thinking about the parallelism of the two time periods.
The following morning Jill is on her way to work, walking down the sidewalk near her news studio building. Suddenly a collective shriek goes up from nearly all the people on the street around her. They are jumping and swatting and crying in pain. People jump out of cars in the middle of the street and writhe and jostle their clothing. At first Jill did not know what happened, but then she sees everyone is covered with red sores on every inch of their exposed skin. It is apparent from the expressions of pain that the sores cover their entire bodies.
Jill hurries on into her building and gets to the news room as fast as she can. She looks at her own skin, but nothing unusual. Jack Ford meets her as she is entering the studio, and his skin is clear. But then she starts seeing the staff, and most of them are affected by the painful skin sores. For the crew the pain was so intense that most could not continue to work. Jack had to take over the camera duties to allow Jill to go on with her news show.
Jack was doing double duty, putting up video and handling the camera. Jack showed video and Jill described what she had seen on the street near her news studio. Eyewitness accounts from around the world all showed the same thing. Most of the people of the world now had painful red sores all over their bodies. And the emphasis was on pain. Nothing could reduce the intensity of it except to try to avoid having the skin touch anything at all. Even soft clothing irritated the sores.
Within the next few days it became obvious that the skin sores had an enormous impact on people everywhere. The pain was intense. Sitting on the sores was very painful, and lying down was almost impossible since so many of the sores became involved. Sleep was therefore nearly impossible, except in very short sessions under extreme exhaustion, only minutes at a time. Just wearing clothing was painful. Within days the world was full of people sleep- walking through their miserable existence. They walked bow-legged with their arms outstretched to avoid touching any sores. While most of the early disasters had been either localized or affected people indirectly, even though severely, the sores put the pain right to each person directly and continually, much like the stinging Swarm had done. It was highly effective at getting people's attention that they were being judged.
Jill noted that very few turned to God as the answer.  The world was now in a state of extreme hardness.  The Second Swarm had killed so many people, nearly 1/3 of all those who were on the earth.  And that was after many had been already killed by famine, disease, war, and disasters.  Except for believers who were spared these judgments, those unbelievers who had survived the Swarm of killer demons were mainly those who had no remaining conscience.
While most of the judgments lasted for a relatively short duration and then ended, the sores remained and did not go away. They turned people into the walking dead, living at the most basic level of bare existence, waiting for their final end. It would not be long.
But in the meantime more judgments were coming. Jill provided her viewers a preview of what was about to happen next. She began to summarize for her audience at the end of each news broadcast what was coming in the near future. She still had many who watched her news show from all over the world. But most refused to accept the truth of what was behind all of it.
Jill's summary at the end of her daily broadcast started out as:
"All sea life will soon die, all drinking water will become undrinkable, the sun will scorch the skin, the world will be plunged into darkness, the way will be prepared for Armageddon, and then Armageddon will finally come, and it is less than six months away."
Within a few days the second Bowl Judgment hit. It targeted sea life.
Residents of the ocean-side community of Malibu, California awoke to see red waves breaking on the beach. It was a disgusting sight, and looked to these residents like blood. In fact, it turned out to actually be blood. This scene repeated in beach communities all over the US, and all over the world. The ocean waves were blood. Soon afterward dead sea creatures began washing onshore. First fish, then starfish and turtles, then whales.  The rotting carcasses became even more disgusting than the blood waves. Soon the stench became unbearable. Oceanographers from around the world used sophisticated instruments to try to determine the extent of the issue. Why were these sea creatures dying in droves? Which types were affected, and which types survived? What they found shocked them. They found no living sea creature of any type in any ocean or sea anywhere on earth. None. All sea creatures were dead, down to the last krill. They concluded this was not a natural event, but an unnatural one. But they refused to see it as a supernatural event.
It was just as Jill had been telling her audience. And as she had become known for doing, Jill read to her audience from Revelation and from her book:
Revelation 16:3 “The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died.”
"The 2nd Bowl turns all the oceans to blood and kills all remaining sea life.  The rain cycle is also disrupted by this judgment since the oceans are key to rain formation. Recall that the Trumpet Judgment had previously killed 1/3 of all sea life, so this Bowl occurs later since all sea life is now killed."
With all sea life dead, there was no food from the seas or oceans. This had been one of the few remaining food options, and now it was gone. And if that were not enough, the painful red sores persisted. And the pain never became any more bearable. Not to mention how ugly everyone had become, which ruined their self-esteem.
Jill reported on how the Bowl Judgments were affecting people. How it disrupted their entire life. Work, play, eating, social life, sleep -- everything was affected. The little pleasures of life were gone. She continually reminded her audience of why these were occurring, and how close the end of the Tribulation is at this point.
Within a month of the blood waves, the third Bowl Judgment hit. The drinking water supply was targeted. Again. Now the entire remaining drinking water supply turned undrinkable.
The world was already starving and thirsty. But now that would be taken to a new level. Jill reads to her audience:
Revelation 16:4 “The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. 5 Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say: “You are just in these judgments, O Holy One, you who are and who were; 6 for they have shed the blood of your holy people and your prophets, and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve.”
It is not an accident that the "blood" theme recurs over and over. God is reminding the unbelieving world of what they did to His own people. Believers had been murdered by those following, and those not resisting, the Antichrist. Millions of believers had been murdered, beheaded, or starved to death during the past several years. A holocaust targeted Jewish believers. Those who did not oppose the Antichrist were with him. Regardless of how innocent any of the remaining unbelievers seemed, they were on the wrong side of history, meaning they were not on God's side. Bad choices led to bad outcomes. God gave everyone plenty of chances to change their minds, but most had refused. Now they were being judged, and judged severely.
This 3rd Bowl Judgment targeted the remaining supply of drinking water.  The 3rd  Trumpet had previously targeted 1/3 of all drinking water, now the remainder was taken away by this Bowl Judgment.  The unbelievers were bloodthirsty while killing so many believers, so God now gives them blood to drink, making them very, very thirsty.  Believers will have special provisions during all these judgments, but the intensity of the adversities will be felt by all as God removes the most basic necessities for sustaining life from unbelievers.  Since the people on earth could not survive very long without drinking water, Armageddon and the Second Advent are very near.
The next two Bowl Judgments would come in rapid succession. Within a month after the drinking water was destroyed, the fourth Bowl Judgment hit.  Scorching sun began to burn the flesh of everyone who ventured outdoors. There was no way to avoid the sun's scorching heat. The scorching was immediate on any exposed flesh. Even a tiny opening in clothing led to instant first degree burns. And due to the painful red sores, people had turned to wearing as little clothing as possible. So when the scorching sun began, they were caught with much of their skin exposed. That made the scorching even worse, since there would be no time to cover up for anyone out in the open.
The scorching sun also burned up the remaining vegetation. There had not been enough sun to grow crops due to the decreased sunlight, but now the low sunlight also scorched what little vegetation was growing.
Jill reported on the fourth Bowl as unbelievers suffered from severe skin pain, which went along with their starving and intense thirst. This Bowl added more skin pain on top of the already painful skin sores. This skin pain was a very direct targeting of individual comfort.
Jill reads to her audience:
Revelation 16:8 “The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was allowed to scorch people with fire. 9  They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.”
The 4th Trumpet Judgment had diminished the sun, and now the 4th Bowl Judgment causes the remaining daylight hours to yield scorching heat on the inhabitants of the earth as the protective layers of the atmosphere are removed. The world switches from freezing cold to scorching heat on their skin. The world is colder but their skin is burning. The unbelievers of the world are in intense pain. The red sores never went away, then scorching was added. The skin is a major source of pain, since it is so near the nerve endings. God puts the pain where it is felt the most -- on the skin.
Jill wonders if anyone was listening. Really listening. She doubted that any were. They were just moths to the flame. They could not stay away. They watched her news show because they were mesmerized, not because they had any belief system.
CHAPTER 28
INVASION OF ISRAEL

President Antivon, now completely revealed as the Antichrist to all who were willing to see the truth, is losing control over his domain. There is death, disaster, pain and destruction everywhere as the Bowl Judgments take their toll. Food and water are very scarce. There is misery at all levels of society. The streets are filled with chaos, lawlessness, looting, mass unrest and riots. His Citizen's Police forces have been decimated by the judgments so their numbers have dwindled, but the ones who remain continue to kill people at will, especially Christians and Jews. Jewish Christians are their number one target. Assassination attempts on the President and his staff occur regularly. Antivon has lost two Chiefs of Staff as a result. There has been a general breakdown of law and order, as lawless gangs rule the cities.
President Antivon decides to take warfare "on the road" to distract from the internal turmoil at home.
The Western Alliance had made a treaty with Israel early during the Tribulation, but President Antivon now has new plans for the Middle East. The Western Alliance wants to set up a base of operations inside Israel, and use it to invade African countries. That will require a large military presence in the region. Although Israeli Prime Minister Garlock is in his pocket, the Israeli military is not. But it has been reduced to just a small military Resistance unit.
Therefore President Antivon cannot rely on Prime Minister Garlock to deliver Israel over to him, so an invasion and forceful takeover of Jerusalem by Western Forces is required since there will be opposition from the Israeli Resistance. The West's plans are set into motion and within a few weeks Western Alliance ships land at the port of Haifa in western Israel while ground forces enter Israel from the northeast. These two army groups converge on Jerusalem in a pincer movement from the north.
Western Alliance forces close in on the Israeli Resistance forces on the northern outskirts of Jerusalem, and their situation is dire. As the Western forces reach Jerusalem, fighting by the Israeli Resistance under Generals Dayan and Gurian is heroic, but they are overpowered and pushed back into the city, followed by street to street and house to house fighting inside the city. Both sides suffer heavy casualties. The Israeli troops fall back into midtown Jerusalem where they become trapped.
It was then the fifth Bowl Judgment happened -- intense darkness on the Antichrist's kingdom and their military forces.
Revelation 16:10 “The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in agony 11 and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had done.”
The supernatural darkness had two purposes, first to blind the military forces of the Antichrist fighting in Israel, and secondly as a judgment on the Antichrist's kingdom. The supernatural darkness blinded both the Western Alliance soldiers and their electronics, but it did not affect the Israeli Resistance forces in any way. This blindness of the Western Alliance allowed the Israeli Resistance forces to escape straight through the middle of the battle lines of the blinded Western forces.
Since this supernatural intense darkness affected only the Western Alliance, it allowed the Israeli Resistance forces to escape the clutches of the Antichrist's forces and withdraw from Jerusalem. They retreated to the outskirts and joined the forces under General Dayan and General Gurian who had set up defenses south of Jerusalem. The Jewish Resistance forces then regrouped in southern Israel near Bethlehem, where they were able to resupply and bring in additional troops from other locations. With a new hiding place established, their numbers were bolstered, and their supplies were renewed. The Israeli Resistance forces were once again ready to take on the enemy who was occupying Jerusalem. But only when the timing was right.
General Dayan addressed the Jewish Resistance fighters:
"This is the same as what happened during the days when the Pharaoh of Egypt hardened his heart against the Jews, and Moses caused darkness for three days as part of the ten plagues on Egypt.  Moses was in ancient Egypt at that time, and he was here today in Jerusalem near the Temple when our Jewish forces needed to escape.  The ancient Egypt event is recorded in Exodus 10:21:
“Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt.” 22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days. 23  No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.”
General Dayan continues: "The power of the Antichrist has been targeted directly, and his kingdom was turned dark. The empire of darkness got the darkness they deserve. It allowed us to escape from Jerusalem today in order to survive. We cannot go back and fight them directly at this point. But we will have our day soon, and the forces of the Antichrist will be wiped out completely. Of this you can be certain."
Israeli General Dayan proceeds to outline the strategy for the remainder of the war, which will be one of opportunistic strategic engagement and defensive covert withdrawals. They cannot afford to attack the forces of the Antichrist head-on at this point. They must pick their battles wisely and retreat when necessary to survive. They cannot save Jerusalem from the Antichrist forces. But they can have an impact, and they can survive to fight during the final stage when the Lord returns. That is when they will defeat the forces which drove them out of Jerusalem. The Israeli Resistance forces will have their own revenge. But they must remain patient.
"The true heroes of the Jewish cause were the soldiers in Israel who rose up against the Antichrist and the Jewish traitor called the False Prophet. These brave fighters were new believers who risked everything to hold back the onslaught of the evil forces of the Western Alliance. They were the ones protecting the rights of Jews everywhere, even though they were but a few." With that, General Dayan departs to set up the logistics necessary to support the long battles which lie ahead. He knows that his brave troops have an enormous task ahead of them, and the battles will be fierce. He prays for his troops as he walks on ahead.
Armageddon is approaching quickly, and his troops will play a key role on that day as they will be given the task of fighting the Western Alliance forces in south Israel and in Jerusalem.
While that was happening in Israel, in the remainder of the Western Alliance the darkness had another purpose, which was judgment. In addition to the effects on the military forces of the Antichrist, the people of the Western Alliance experienced deep darkness which the sun could not penetrate, or moon or star light. No light of any type could penetrate the supernatural darkness. Flashlights, building lights, street lights, car lights, cell phone light, candle and flame light were all useless. There was no natural or artificial light of any type. Everyone was essentially blind since their eyes could not reveal anything of any type without light. It drove intense fear.
Many people across the entire Western Alliance were caught out of their homes when the darkness struck. There was no way to get home for most people. No one could go to or from work. Even if they were stuck at their workplace no work could be done.  People trying to walk home were seldom successful. There were many injuries from cuts, falls, and other hazards but no one could help them. All sense of a normal life was removed by the darkness. Each person was forced to focus primarily on their own thoughts since they could not engage in any of their normal distractions. No online interaction, no reading, and getting food to eat was very difficult. Not even a gas flame emitted light so it could not be seen. During this time houses burned to the ground but no one saw the flames. The helplessness was overwhelming for many. They could not be alone with their own thoughts without some distraction to keep them from thinking too much. Most people survived by living a life of distraction without thinking. Anything that kept them from their own thoughts was useful. There was no anchor in their soul to stabilize them, so they tried not to think. Distraction was the key to survival.
But the intense darkness forced them inward, which was frightening since they found nothing there. Just emptiness, loneliness, and nothingness.
Fortunately for Jill, she was at her apartment when the darkness struck. She knew it was coming so she was prepared. She could not get to work, and no news could be broadcast during this judgment. Jill had memorized her small apartment and gathered everything she needed as close as possible. She had stacks of pre-made food and bottles of water alongside her sofa. This enabled very limited movement in order to survive the ordeal. It would not last long, she knew.
Prior to this judgment, Jill had read about it. She knew she would not be able to do anything but sit and wait it out once the darkness hit. She had memorized information related to the judgment.
After two days the darkness was gone. Unbelievers went back to just being extremely hungry and thirsty, and trying not to inflame the constant sores which had remained just as painful. They saw that the believers around them did not have such issues, except that they suffered some degree of privation. But they did not have the sores. The unbelievers began to hate those who had no sores. They themselves could have lost the sores at any time, but they refused to turn to God. From this point on there would be almost no one change their mind about needing God's help. They were totally hardened in their souls.
This is not the last of the darkness which the Antichrist forces will see. There will also be a separate day of total darkness over the entire earth on the day the Lord returns, and that will occur as the world's Alliances are assembled at Armageddon.
Back in Israel, the Western Alliance troops secured Jerusalem as their new base of operations. It would be used by the West for further conquests of African nations. Meanwhile, the Western Alliance forces were angered by what had happened to them in Israel. So they took their revenge on the city of Jerusalem which they had captured. It was as Zechariah had prophesied several thousand years before:
Zechariah 14:1 “A day of the LORD is coming, Jerusalem, when your possessions will be plundered and divided up within your very walls. 2 I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to fight against it; the city will be captured, the houses ransacked, and the women raped. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city.
The Western Alliance forces began to round up Jews inside Jerusalem to be shipped out to concentration camps. The troops needed their homes for themselves since they would be based there. So they stole their houses and food and possessions. A procession of Jewish prisoners several miles long was marched out of the city toward the east for shipment out of Israel to unknown locations.
Armageddon is inevitable at this point. The stage has been set. The world leaders are drunk with power madness and cannot see anything else. They are about to be drawn into the meat grinder they themselves had constructed, and it would be called "Armageddon.”
CHAPTER 29
REMAINING IMPEDIMENTS REMOVED

The accumulation of the Bowls is taking a severe toll, with the painful red sores, the oceans turned to blood and sea life destroyed, drinking blood instead of water, scorching heat, and intense darkness. The unbelievers of the earth are in maximum pain and under extreme stress. But they still refuse to accept the real solution to their problems.
The sixth Bowl Judgment occurred about a month later. Most would miss the point of it, but this judgment would have great impact. It would remove remaining impediments and clear the way for Armageddon.
Israeli Resistance commander General Dayan sees the sixth Bowl coming, and explains it to his staff.  He reads from Revelation 16:12:
“The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East. 13 Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 14 They are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.”
General Dayan continues: "The Bible says the sixth Bowl causes "the Euphrates River to dry up" so the Eastern Alliance can bring its massive military forces across the Arab countries and into Israel in preparation for Armageddon. The "Euphrates" reference is an analogy to removing what has been blocking their advance, namely, the Southern Alliance military forces. We have recently seen the Southern Alliance pulling all its troops out of Iraq, Iran, and neighboring countries so they can be sent toward Israel, and that is happening right now.
Additionally, Southern Alliance forces from the Arabian Peninsula have left the area and are now attacking Western Alliance installations using multiple small engagements which have targeted supply lines. So the movement of Arab military forces out of their own countries clears the way for the Eastern Alliance to move its massive armies straight through the Arab nations, including Iraq which is the location of the Euphrates River. The armies of all four world Alliances will soon be assembled in the Jezreel Valley, at a location which has become known as Armageddon. That is why this sixth Bowl Judgment is important. It is God's purpose and design to pull all the armies of the world together for one final battle."
