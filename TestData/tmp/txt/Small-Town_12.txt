“You three can keep me company at detention starting from 2:30 in here.” He then looks at Kellan and Silver. “You two clearly know how to listen better than these three.”
He smirks as he opens the door. “Hopefully this time you won't forget, otherwise there will be serious consequences.”
I couldn't eat during lunch break. The thought of eating anything made me feel nauseas. Sam kept begging me and begging me to go tonight and after continuously saying no to her, she just wouldn't give up. I gave up after the hundredth time and told her that I would go, but only for a little while. To say that she was happy was an understatement. She screamed so loud in the cafeteria, everyone was staring at her.
After lunch, Sam told me that she'd be leaving early in preparation for tonight because she wants to look perfect for Bane even though she looks pretty good in absolutely anything.
At 2:30, I arrive in our English class where detention is being held. I open the door to see Mr. Edmund already in his chair.
He indicates for me to enter and have a seat.
I take my usual seat in the front and wait for further instructions.
After last night, I thought a part of me would feel different, like I'd be able to hear and smell things that no ordinary person could do, but nothing.
The door opens and in walks Ryder followed by Bane.
Ryder pulls the chair out placed next to me while Bane sits on his own at another desk.
Mr. Edmund stands from his chair and stares at each of us individually. “Yesterday, you three decided to disobey my orders by leaving this very classroom. Therefore you will stay here until the end of the day. I will allow you to speak, but you will not, I repeat not be allowed to move from this room. Do I make myself clear?”
Neither Bane nor Ryder say a word. I quietly murmur. “Yes, sir.”
As Mr. Edmund sits, I take out my notes for Biology and pretend to look over them to make myself look busy.
Ryder lounges in his chair with one leg propped on the other while Bane puts his head on the desk.
“You okay?”
I swivel my head towards Ryder. “I'm fine.” A moment of silence. I turn back to my notes. “Are you sure?”
“Mhm.”
Another moment of silence.
“Are you just gonna sit there and ignore me?”
“I'm not ignoring you. I'm just revising for my test.” He scoffs. “Sure, I know what you're doing.”
“And what exactly is that.” My focus remains on the paper.
“Don't pretend that last night never happened because it did.”
I face him, my voice rising a little. “Nothing happened so just forget about it!”
Mr. Edmund's head rises from the papers in front of him. “Shush!”
“Keep telling yourself that Alice because we both know you wanted me.”
“It was a mistake!” I hiss.
Ryder looks angrily at me, shoves himself out of the chair and throws his chair to the back of the class.
Mr. Edmund remains seated in his chair with a look of boredom on his face.
“Get the chair and sit down Mr. King.” “Nah, screw this.”
He calls Bane and they both leave the classroom.
I sit in shock just as Mr. Edmund casually walks to the front of my desk.
“Let today be the first warning Alice, because disobedience is not tolerated in my classroom. Ever. Those two will definitely not be returning to this class after their behaviour this evening. One thing I will tell is that I would carefully advise you to think about who you surround yourself with.” He turns back to his desk. “You are dismissed, Alice.”
I quickly gather my things and rush out of the classroom.
At the end of the day, I decide to surprise my mother at the hospital with an early supper. My mother adores Chinese food but working night shifts she barely has the chance to eat any. I stop by at the reception to give them my name and my reason for being there, when I see a recognisable face reading a magazine.
“Max?”
He pauses for a minute then decides to look up at me. I'm taken aback when I don't see any bruises on his face or any sign of the crutches he had with him yesterday.
“Oh...hey Alice.”
He remains seated in the chair.
“You look much better than you did yesterday.”
There are no words I can manage to formulate. Max was beaten to a pulp yesterday and he looks very much unscathed.
“Yeah, my mom has healing powers.” He nervously chuckles.
I look down at his leg to see no cast either. “And your leg?”
He shrugs. “My mom can fix anything. I told you yesterday that it was nothing to worry about. Look at me, I'm fine.”
I frown, trying to come up with a reasonable explanation on how he's gone from looking like a beaten up rag doll, to looking completely fine, but I come up empty handed.
“So what brings you here?”
I show him the Chinese that I've brought to my mother. “I've brought my mum dinner. What brings you here?”
“I'm giving a ride home to my mother.”
I nod in understanding when I hear my mother calling my name. “Alice! What a surprise!”
I hug my mother tightly. “Yeah, I brought you your favourite Chinese, seeing as you never have the chance to eat on the weekends.”
My mother smiles. “Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.”
“When do you get off work?” “Late, sweetie.”
As always.
She takes the bag from me and kisses my forehead. “Do you have plans with Sam tonight?”
“There's a party tonight and I told her I'd go but...”
“No buts! You're going! It's the weekend and you deserve to have some fun, alright?” She hugs me again and leaves.
“There's a party tonight?” Max asks from behind me.
“Yeah, but it's at Ryder's house.” I face Max as he stands from his chair.
“Do you think I could come with you?”
“For someone that was beaten up by them, you don't seem that bothered.”
He shrugs. “What's the harm in attending their party, right?”
“Are you sure you wanna go?”
“Yeah! Why not? It's not like anything is going to happen!”
And so we both leave.
Chapter 13

The first thing I do when I leave the hospital is text Sam for the address of the party. The sensible side of me would be to not text her and go home where I can sit down with a good book or catch up with homework. After this week, I feel that going tonight to the party and having a few drinks couldn't hurt anybody because for once in my life, I can let my hair down and enjoy myself.
I won't have to worry about changing unexpectedly, I've proven all that I needed to prove, so for that I won't let anything stop me from having somewhat of a good time.
“So whereabouts is this party?” Max asks as he takes out his car keys and twirls them around his fingers.
“I don't know, but I've texted Sam to ask where it is because she's probably there right now dancing on the tables or something.”
He chuckles. “Is that something she does at every party?”
I shiver against the gust of wind that passes by which makes me rub both of my hands together. “She likes to have fun which is the complete opposite of me.” I sigh and shake my head in despair. “I don't even know why I'm going to this party. I mean I hate social activities.”
Max takes off his leather jacket and places it around my shoulders. “Here, this will keep you nice and warm.”
He presses the button to unlock his black Range Rover, stands on the passenger side, places his hand on the door and looks at me. “You're going tonight because you wanna look out for your friend, and that makes you a good person. Maybe you know deep down that she needs someone to look after her.”
I consider his words and slowly nod.
He opens the door of the car and waits for me to sit so that he can close it behind me. In that moment I get a text from Sam with the address. I show it to Max as soon as he closes his door.
The first thing I notice when we arrive closer to our destination are the cars lined up along the pavement and the people scattered everywhere along the property. I see people dancing, drinking and even some already passed out.
I get out from the car and walk alongside Max towards the house, the music playing so loud I can recognize the song from inside.
The house is hidden like the trees are purposely hiding it from view. I can't imagine what Ryder's house must look like.
I look around to see nothing but trees and it instantly makes me wonder what lurks beyond these woods.
Max and I follow a path that leads further into the woods, I place my hands in his jacket to keep warm when suddenly I inhale the intoxicating aroma of musk and pine needles overrunning the fresh air.
I walk a little farther, come to the clearing of the woods when I see the flickering flames of a campfire. I look at each person individually but see no recognizable faces.
We pass the campfire without a backward glance and slowly reach the house.
Wow...
The only word that comes to my mind when I look at this house is utterly breath-taking. The house is surrounded by glass and from the exact spot to where I'm standing, I can see everything. From here I see people dancing together, playing beer pong and some even doing body shots.
Hopefully Sam wasn't embarrassing herself in there.
I decide to go inside before changing my mind and take the stairs two at a time. Max can choose whether to follow or stick around outside but I have someone that I need to find. I push through the bodies that are in my way, to which I receive dirty looks and murmurs that are too quiet for me to understand. I finally get myself into the living room where I see a lot of people kissing and some doing things that I wish they could take outside.
People dance in the middle of the room but Sam is nowhere to be seen. I look behind me to see Max pushing his way through with the look of annoyance on his face, I call out his name but it's drowned out by the sound of music.
Having looked around the living area more than once, I decide to look for Sam in the kitchen, and the first thing I see is a stunning girl propped up on the steel counter wearing a tight silver dress covered in sparkles. The minute Silver's eyes meet mine she rolls her eyes.
“If you're trying to get Ryder's attention, he won't spare you a glance dressed like that.”
She takes in my black skinny jeans, the band t-shirt and leather jacket.
I ignore her and get right to the point. “Have you seen Sam anywhere?”
“Why would I care about where your annoying little friend is?”
She picks up the solo cup next to her and drains the whole thing.
“Because I'm trying to look for her, and I'd really appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction?”
Silver gets down from the counter and sways seductively to stand in front of me. “Sure I'll point you in the right direction. Go find Sam yourself, leave this house and stay away from what's mine, otherwise I'll kick your ass.”
I look at her in confusion. “What are you talking about?” “Stay away from Ryder.”
“I couldn't care less about him. All I want to do is find Sam because she came on her own, and I just wanna see if she's alright.”
“Look little wolf. You have no business here so take your blonde trash ass and get the hell off my property.”
“I'm not going anywhere until I find Sam.” She sighs, 'You never listen, do you?'
Suddenly, Max comes to joins us in the kitchen with relief written on his face. “I didn't know how to get through without pissing somebody off.”
Silver sneers at Max. “What the hell do you think you're doing?”
“What?” Max looks taken aback.
“Who said you could come to this party?” She places her hands on her hips.
“Well, I thought that if someone's throwing a party, then everyone's obliged to come.”
Silver tuts. “You thought wrong new guy, and for that you better watch out before someone really shows you how things are done around here.”
Max squares his shoulders and approaches her. “Silver, isn't it?”
She arches her brow in confirmation.
“See, where I come from, people don't usually talk like that and get away with things. I may not be good enough to pass as being a cool or a tough guy, but at least I have the decency to treat others with respect. Fair enough if you don't like me, because truth be told I'm not utterly fond of you either. So, the next time you threaten me or anyone I care about Silver, you won't like the outcome. That I assure you.”
Silver shakes her head and murmurs. “You're dead.” Then walks away.
He turns back to me with an expressionless look on his face. “Did you find Sam yet?”
I shake my head.
“We'll search the house. I'm sure she's fine Alice.”
Knowing Sam she's probably somewhere really obvious because she blends in so well with these people. Maybe she's found some guy to spend the night with and doesn't want to be disturbed, but as a concerned friend I just want to see for myself that she's okay.
“I think I'm gonna look for her upstairs to see if she's in one of the bedrooms. Do you mind checking outside?”
“Sure. We'll meet up in a few minutes by the campfire?” “Yeah.”
I rush out of the kitchen and make my way up the stairs. People are sitting on the steps which makes it extremely hard for me to pass - I slither my way as quickly as possible to reach the second level of the house and to my left, I see three doors, one of which is open, one ajar and one closed completely. I look to the right and see another three doors, two of which are open and one closed.
With my new ability, I try as hard as I can to reach out to hear Sam's voice but fail to hear her for I have no idea on how to use it.
With a disappointed sigh, I walk to the left side of the house and come face to face with the door that's ajar. The room is cast in blackness and the first thing I notice is the distinctive smell of beer and the sound of deep male voices. I open the door slowly only to see Bane and Kellan playing what looks like a first person shooting game, but the moment I step foot inside both of their heads turn in unison to my direction - it takes them a while to realize who I am. Bane looks at me for a second but loses interest and carries on playing the game, Kellan however smiles and gets up from his position on the couch.
“Alice! Didn't know you'd be attending our amazing party?” He picks me off the floor and crushes me tightly to his chest.
I scowl even though it's pretty hard to breathe considering his strength and the unmistakable smell of beer. “Please let go of me. You stink of alcohol.”
Kellan just chuckles. “I might be drunk right now, but I'm still happy to see you.”
He lets go of me and goes to sit back on the couch and picks up the controller, I take this as an opportunity to ask if either of them have seen Sam.
“Hey guys, have you seen Sam anywhere? She said she'd be at this party, but I can't seem to find her.”
Kellan thinks for a moment then nods. 'I saw her a few hours ago but she was more interested in our big sexy beast over here.” Kellan nudges Bane suggestively but receives what sounds like a menacing growl in return.
“Where is she now?”
Kellan shrugs. “I've no idea. One minute she was all over Bane, and the next she ran off crying.”
What could he have done to make her run off? “Bane?”
He doesn't acknowledge me. “Bane? What did you do?”
I wait a few seconds to see if he'll say anything but when I realize that he won't answer me, I march up to the TV and switch it off.
“What the fuck is your problem!?” He roars in agitation.
“Right now you're my problem asshole. What did you do to Sam?”
“Who the fuck is Sam?”
I can't believe this is the guy Sam's pining after. “Sam? The girl you were with that ran off crying.” My patience is starting to run out.
“I make a lot of girls cry. That's why it makes it easy to forget their faces.” Bane dismisses me as he gets up from the couch, looks out the window where he sees people
outside enjoying the party.
“This is not a joke Bane. Just please tell me where she went because I'm starting to think that something bad has actually happened to her, and with the murders going  on.	”
He sighs and turns to look at me and Kellan. “Relax, she followed me up here, but I told her to leave me alone cause she was trying too hard to get my attention. She chose to ignore that and started groping me that may have had me insulting her.”
“I thought you liked it when women got a little frisky with you.” Kellan winks jokingly at Bane.
“Shut your damn mouth Kellan!”
Kellan might be amused, but I certainly am not. “So, after you insulted her she ran off? Do you know where?”
“It's not like I give a shit but she ran into the bathroom at the other end of the hallway.”
“See? Was that really hard to tell me.”
I leave the room to go to the other end of the hall. I have no idea which of the three rooms is the bathroom so I decide to knock on the closed door and wait patiently.
“Sam?” I listen intently for anything on the other side but still nothing.
I call her name again when I hear footsteps on the other end of the hall and see Kellan.
“She's in there.”
“How do you know for sure?” I try the door only to find that it's locked.
“I've been hearing her crying in there for over an hour.” “You could have told me that earlier!”
“I was playing a game. I wanted to beat Bane because he kept kicking my ass!”
“I seriously couldn't care less! Just help me get her out!”
The door surprisingly opens and the first thing I see is Sam's tear stained face with mascara running down both of her cheeks.
“You guys are so loud I couldn't even concentrate on crying anymore.”
I pull her into my arms. “You scared the shit out of me when I couldn't find you. I started thinking the worst.”
She steps away and wipes her eyes. 'Tonight didn't go as I'd hoped, but I just wanna go home and get the hell away from here.”
Kellan grasps a hold of her hands and smiles reassuringly at her. “Ignore Bane and what he said to you because he's like that with everybody. Like a girl such as yourself, he was probably intimidated by your beauty.”
Sam smiles back at him but says nothing in response.
Is that a blush!?
“I think someone needs to lay off the alcohol	”
The door on the other end suddenly slams open with Bane rushing down the stairs, yelling at Kellan to follow him.
The three of us follow Bane outside where tons of people have stopped and created a circle around the campfire. It's hard for me to see what's going on inside the circle, but with Bane pushing his way to the front it soon reveals who is inside.
The first thing I see are two male bodies throwing punches at each other, when suddenly they both fall to the floor with their faces facing away from me. The larger one out of the two has black hair with a muscular build while the smaller one has golden hair.
The bigger male head-butts the other and gains the upper hand by sitting on top of the other male's abdomen and starts punching him repeatedly in the face. The smaller male lies unmoving on the floor as the dark haired male rises off the floor and roars in triumph, but when his green eyes meet mine, I freeze and run to the bloodied body lying on the floor.
I run past Silver where I see her applauding for Ryder with a smirk on her face.
Lying on his back in his own blood with his face unrecognizable is Max. His face covered with bruises and cuts that without knowing the colour of his hair, I wouldn't have been able to make out who the person was.
I kneel down beside him and feel completely relieved when I see his chest slowly rising and falling. I gently caress his bloodied cheek comfortingly, but when he tries to speak, blood pours out of his mouth.
“Shhh.” I plead. “Try not to speak, okay?”
I look around me to see people leaving to go inside the house to probably carry on with the party.
I can't believe that not one person stopped the fight. Why is it that a fight is seen as entertainment? People get severely hurt and for what? To show who's bigger or stronger? Who does Ryder think he is?
“Sam!” I call her name from my position next to Max.
The moment she comes over she gasps in horror at the sight in front of her. “Alice!?”
“Can you help me carry Max to his car please?”
I get up and ready myself to pick Max's beaten body off the floor when I hear Kellan call out my name from behind me. “Here let me.”
I watch as Kellan picks up Max effortlessly off the floor, and leads him into the forest and out to where his car is.
“Are you coming?” Sam stops in her tracks when she realizes that I'm not following her.
“You go ahead with Kellan. I'll be right behind you guys.”
I turn my back to her, and rush back into the house in search for Ryder.
Chapter 14

I ignore the fact that I have Max's blood on my hands, but that doesn't stop the blood from pumping in my ears and the feeling of adrenaline running through my entire body.
With Ryder nowhere in sight in the living area or the kitchen, I take the stairs and cross the right side of the room.
One of the previous doors that was closed is now empty which makes me turn to the other door that is closed shut. This gut feeling inside of me suggests that Ryder's in there - I stand corrected when I open the door to see that he's not alone. There's no jealousy or anger when I notice Ryder's body and a pair of legs wrapped around his waist, I feel only pity.
It's hard to see who the girl is, but there is no denying who might be kissing Ryder right now.
“You know, I genuinely feel sorry for you.”
Both heads swing towards the doorway, Ryder looks like he's seen a ghost while Silver looks like she wants to kill me for interrupting them.
“I thought you left.” Ryder gets up from the bed.
They may not have been sleeping together, but seeing them kissing each other, bothers me somehow, but I still can't stand to look at either of them.
“Oh no please, don't stop on my account seeing as you both don't give a shit that someone nearly died tonight.”
Silver laughs. “He deserved it. He accused Ryder, Bane and Kellan for something that they didn't do and came here unannounced. I mean seriously, he had it coming”
“Silver get out.”
Silver stops laughing instantly. “What?”
“Get the hell out!” Ryder yells, causing a shiver to run down my back.
Silver scurries to pick up her shoes off the floor and runs out of the room.
“Shut the door.” Ryder commands as he lounges on his black leather couch.
“No, I'm good here.”
I can sense that he's growing impatient with me but after tonight, he's changed to being a completely different person to whom I thought he was before, “Shut the damn door and sit down, Alice.”
“Don't tell me what to do! What you did tonight was brutal and horrific! Why would you do something like that!? Do you realize that Max could've died or do you not care at all? He's not an Alpha like you, so stop whatever grudge you have against him and let it go!”
Ryder doesn't say anything for a few minutes then shakes his head. “There's something wrong with him Alice and you refuse to see past the nice act he's putting on.”
“What? Max has been nothing but kind to me.” Ryder looks at me with a nasty scowl on his face.
“Explain the injuries then. Tell me that you're not curious about how he didn't have a scratch on him tonight.” “You mean before you decided to beat him up again.”
“I didn't beat him up the first time, but I wish I did because I'm telling you right now, he's a lying shit who's messing with the wrong people.”
I'm still curious about Max's injuries but I won't admit that to Ryder - I still haven't come up with an explanation on how it could've been possible, and so I refuse to give him the satisfaction of agreeing.
“Max's mother's a nurse, she probably...”
“Don't tell me you actually believe that!?” He interrupts me. “Why are you refusing to see what's actually in front of you!?”
“And what exactly is that?”
He shoves himself off the couch and storms towards me where I stand in the doorway. 'I don't know yet but I will! Give me a few days and I'll soon find out.”
“Sounds to me like you really want something to be wrong with him.”
Ryder leans down closer to me. “I do because I want him to stay as far away from you as possible.”
I shove his chest but I always seem to forget that his body is as hard as steel. “How can you say that!? You have no right to speak to me like that after what I saw you doing.”
He waves me off. “Silver's meaningless, and I have needs just like any other wolf does. Besides, it's not like I need to give you an explanation on who I'm being intimate with.”
“There'd be too many to count if I did ask you anyway.” I taunt.
It's silent for a few seconds then I take a deep breath. “I don't care that you've slept with Silver in the past because that's between you and her. I don't know why I came up here, but I know for one thing that I didn't like what I saw out there. For a second, I thought for sure Max was dead. Now there's something bigger going on in this town, and you're taking it out on some guy that has no idea about it. This shit with Max ends right now because when the next month is here we're gonna have another dead body. That's what we should be focusing on.”
My heart is beating by the time I finish talking, but I also feel relieved that I spoke freely about how I felt. I can't believe that a part of me feared about speaking my mind to someone like Ryder, but somehow I feel like I'm getting through to him slowly.
“I'm not promising anything Alice because if he gets in my way one more time, I'll do more than just throw in a couple of punches. He's up to something, and I'm gonna find out what it is. You need to open your eyes and see what kind of person he actually is before it's too late.”
It's my turn to shake my head. “You're wrong about him, but you're not gonna change the way you feel about him so it looks like I'm done here.”
I turn to walk away but stop when I hear my name coming from Ryder.
“What?”
“For once Alice, please listen to me on this.”
I don't answer him. Instead I walk down the stairs, ignore the people still dancing and evacuate the house. I pass the empty campfire and carry on walking into the woods and end up at the clearing. I spot Max's black Range Rover straight away and see Kellan pacing in front of the bright headlights.
A couple of steps towards the Range Rover, Kellan stops pacing and rushes towards me.
“How's he doing?”
All Kellan does is run his hand through his hair. “He's in a really bad way and he's losing a lot of blood. If we don't treat him soon it's gonna get worse.”
“I'll take him to my house, it's much closer than the hospital. My mom won't be there and I'll use her spare medical kit.”
I make my way towards the driver's side to see Max lying in the backseat with his head resting on Sam's lap.
As soon as I reach for the handle it's pulled back by Kellan's hand. 'I'll drive.”
“You've had a few drinks.”
“I have but now I'm sober. The alcohol wears off much quicker when you're a wolf.”
Well, that sucks.
The journey in the car was somewhat peaceful - no one spoke the whole time and in a way the silence was comfortable. I think all of us felt that silence was what we needed in that moment and as we arrived, the house cast in complete blackness was a welcoming feeling that I've longed for all day.
“You girls go inside and I'll bring him in.”
I place my hand reassuringly on his shoulder. “Kellan, you don't need to do this. You've done enough.”
“I might not like the guy, but he didn't deserve this.”
I rush into the house, turn on all the lights and look around for a place where Max can lie down.
Sam soon follows after with a distant look on her face. “Sam? You okay?”
She says nothing for a while then wipes her eyes, “This wasn't how the night should've ended.”
I grab the medical kit from under the sink and place it on the dining table. “You know, it's not your fault.”
“What's not my fault?” Sam crosses her arms over her chest.
“The situation with Bane. He's like that with everyone, and he won't change.”
She looks at me in disdain. “This isn't just about Bane. This is about how our friend almost got killed by a shapeshifter tonight, and to make things worse he doesn't even know that! Why are we associating ourselves with people like Ryder!? Before you got bitten, they didn't even know that we existed, and now they can't seem to stop following us. I'm going to be honest with you and say that I hate the fact that we now know about Mr. Daniels, and with what's going on in this town because I'm scared about what could be out there, whether it be something of the supernatural or not. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder in fear that something is coming after me.”
“Sam..”
Before I can respond to her, Kellan chooses that moment to bring in a bloodied Max into the house. I immediately guide him towards the dining table where he gently lays Max down on the table. I quickly wash my hands to avoid catching any kind of infection from the wounds Ryder inflicted on Max and rush back to the table.
“Do you need my help?” Kellan asks me just as I gently put pressure on the wounds with a sterile clean cloth to stop the bleeding.
“Thanks but I'm sure I can do it by myself being a nurse's daughter and all.”
I rush to one of the overhead cupboards and grab a bowl to fill up with water.
“If you need anything, just call me alright?”
Kellan disappears into the living room followed by a silent Sam.
I take the bowl to the table where Max silently lies and use the clear water to rinse the wounds on his face. Having no idea if open wounds are on his body, I take a pair of scissors from the medical kit and cut up the middle of his shirt. I close my eyes hoping that his body has been left unscathed, but when I open them, tears start to fall when I notice the purple bruises on both sides of his ribs.
With my fingers, I gently examine him to find out if there's any broken ribs, but sigh in relief when I don't feel anything out of place. I draw my attention back to his badly injured face and apply some antibiotic cream to help keep the cuts moist and to help the body's natural healing process. Through it all, Max doesn't flinch or show any kind of discomfort as I treat him.
I take out one of the chairs and sit next to him when suddenly he starts to stir. He looks around in confusion but soon relaxes when he sees me sitting next to him.
He sits up so effortlessly and hangs his legs over the table when he overcomes with dizziness, I rush to him quickly and hold his shoulders to help keep him from falling forwards. “You should be lying down.”
Max only chuckles. “Alice, I'm fine, honestly.”
“No, you shouldn't do this to yourself. Your body needs to rest.”
Max pulls my hands off his shoulders and cradles them in his palms. “I've done enough resting for tonight.”
“You didn't see what I saw back at the party. Nothing will make me forget what I saw.”
He strokes his thumb gently along my fingertips. “I'm sorry you had to see me in that state. Again.”
“That's the second time I've seen you covered in bruises and cuts, and I still don't know the reason behind it. You shouldn't mess with someone like Ryder, because he'll win every time.”
Max doesn't say anything.
“I'm sorry, I didn't mean to insult you.”
“No, I like the fact that you care about me. It's nice to know that somebody does at least.”
As a way of an apology I lean forward, clutch him tightly to my chest in a friendly embrace, but as I pull back, his face is inches away from mine. I stay rooted to the spot not knowing what to do, and before I have the chance to process what's happening, Max's lips meet mine.
I jerk my head back quickly and move to put some distance between us.
Max closes his eyes and shakes his head. “I'm so sorry. I don't know what I was thinking.”
“No it's fine. You don't need to apologise.”
Max avoids eye contact, looks down at the floor to realize that his shirt is torn.
“I had to cut your shirt to see if you had anything underneath that needed some treatment.”
“Thanks.”
He climbs off the table and stands with his hands in his pockets. “I should be going. It shouldn't have been your responsibility to look after me so I really appreciate it. So, thanks.”
I shrug. “It's no big deal. Yu're my friend and friends help each other.”
We stand in the kitchen in awkward silence, when I hear footsteps coming closer to where I'm standing. Kellan enters the kitchen, and leans against the door nodding in greeting at me and Max.
“Right, I think that's my cue to leave.” Max makes his way to the front door when I remember that I'm still wearing his leather jacket.
“Max, wait your jacket.”
The door closes and I'm left standing alone in the entryway.
“So, he kissed you huh?” Kellan says from behind me.
“You heard that?” I turn to Kellan with a look of fascination on my face.
Kellan scoffs. “I heard everything. It's hard to shut everything out when you have heightened senses. As a wolf, you should be able to experience it for yourself.” “I'm actually starting to think that I'm not a wolf.”
He frowns. “Why do you say that?”
“I don't feel any different at all. It's like the change never happened and I'm back to my normal self. Tonight I tried finding Sam by hearing her or finding her scent, but nothing.”
Kellan thinks for a moment. “That's not abnormal. For some wolves it takes time for them to learn and get used to their new abilities. Maybe that's why you're going through this. Trust me, it's nothing to worry about, but it's not something I can teach you.”
“Then who can teach me?”
“To be able to learn your new abilities, you're gonna have to go to someone with a lot of experience, and obviously that someone can only be an Alpha. So, Ryder's gonna have to teach you himself.”
Great...
Chapter 15

The house is silent and slightly cold, but that doesn't stop the thoughts from rushing inside my head. I'm far from happy about the fact that I'll have to learn the wolf way by someone that I can barely stand, let alone talk to.
There has to be another way surely?
I'd take lessons with Bane first before learning anything from Ryder after what I saw tonight. Max's face will again be on my mind for a while, and until I find out all the answers that are left unresolved, I'm left feeling incomplete - I can't think of anything as to why Ryder did what he did.
I lie wide awake in my bed when I hear the door to my house closing downstairs. I lie awake most nights just to hear my mum coming through that door at ridiculous hours, and yet she still returns to the hospital. She loves doing what she does best - the things she can do mesmerizes me.
I turn to my side; away from the door and shut my eyes ready for sleep to overtake me.
When I hear the door to my bedroom open gently, I smile happily to myself. Not once has my mother forgotten to check on me straight when she comes home. In a way, I think she does it to reassure herself that I'm still here with her.
She never says anything to me, she has a quick look to see if I'm asleep and then leaves quietly, and she never closes the door. So when I hear the door start closing and footsteps approaching my bed, I know something isn't right. I swiftly turn the lamp on placed on my bedside table and turn to face whoever's entered my room.
It doesn't matter how many times I see him, he'll always make me feel nervous, but for some reason seeing him here right now, makes me forget about the argument we had earlier.
Ryder stands unmoving in the middle of my room - his clothes soaked from the wet weather outside. He wears black skinny jeans with a white shirt sticking to him that makes out his bare muscular chest underneath. His hair is slicked back with droplets of rain falling every so often on his face, and he also breathes heavily like he's been running to get here.
I'm frozen from the position in my bed wondering what has brought Ryder here in the middle of the night.
“Ryder, what are you doing?”
“Is it true?” Ryder asks in a gravelly voice which in return makes my heart skip a beat.
It takes me a couple of seconds for me to answer him. “Is what true?”
Ryder crosses his arms over his chest, causing the muscles of his biceps to bulge through the sleeves. “What Kellan said to me.”
I shake my head. “It was no big deal. Max kissed me and...”
“That's not what I meant.” “Oh.”
“I was told that you don't feel as though you're a wolf.”
I don't hesitate. “Yeah, it's true. I don't feel any different. At all.”
Ryder thinks for a moment then goes to lean on the wall right beside my window. “You'll come to my house tomorrow.”
“Excuse me?”
Never in my life have I ever had someone order me around like that other than my mother.
I don't know whether I like it or not....
“You need to learn fast. The full moon is in two weeks and we can't waste another day. Now, this could be because you fought the first transformation, or it's just because you're shutting your wolf out without realising it. Trust me doing that is the worst thing you could do. If you shut her out she's just going to disobey you on every decision you make, and that will make her go feral.
Making her feral could result in you never changing back into a human.”
“It's not my fault that I can't summon her. I'm new to this and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong.”
Ryder slowly approaches the bed and stands at my side; looking down at me. “I'm not gonna to say that it's not your fault because it is and deep down you know it too, but you need to let her run free because it's what she needs and wants. She's probably pacing around right now in irritation with you, and I bet she's one pissed off wolf.”
I don't say a word as he talks to me about how it's my fault that I don't feel connected to my wolf like I should be. I know that it's my fault and I feel guilty about it, but with him reminding me all the time for making that wrong decision, it's just going to make me feel worse than I already do. I want her to run free and give her the freedom that she needs, but I'm consciously worried about someone or something hurting the two of us. I'm new to this whole thing so maybe showing up at Ryder's house tomorrow wouldn't be such a bad thing, I mean, I'll be learning how to be a wolf and I'll see what amazing things I can do just like Kellan told me.
“I don't want her to be pissed off with me. Ever.”
That's the last thing I'd ever want..
Ryder places his hand firmly on my thigh. “Come tomorrow and I'll teach you everything you need to know, and we'll take it slow and steady. Most likely she's gonna be hard work, and she's going to think that she's in control, and considering that you're an Alpha too, you're gonna have a short fused stubborn son of a bitch of a wolf on your hands. So, we're going to need numbers.” “You're making it sound like she's feral already.”
Ryder backs away to look out the window. “I can sense her emotions right this second, and I'm telling you she is not happy. I don't know how I didn't pick up on it sooner.”
“Is that supposed to make me feel better?”
A second ticks by when Ryder sighs. “Your mom's home. I better leave before she thinks her daughter's up to no good.”
The bright lights of the headlights shine on Ryder's form as my mother turns into the driveway.
I get out of the bed, approach Ryder and place my hand on his arm. “I'll be there.”
He looks at my hand wrapped around his arm, moves to look at me then nods. “Good.”
I drop my hand from his arm as he moves to open my window when I remember the conversation we had earlier, I call his name but he doesn't turn around.
“About tonight, I just want you to know that I don't judge you for what you did.”
He turns to face me with his piercing green eyes. “Which part? The one where I beat the shit out of your friend or the fact that you caught me kissing Silver?”
I'm taken aback and look at Ryder with a frown. “I don't judge you for kissing her.”
Ryder leans right into my face. “Then answer me this, why do I feel so guilty that it was you who walked through that door?”
Before I have a chance to reply, the door downstairs closes and our little moment is broken too quickly. He looks at me one last time, turns and jumps out the window. I rush to it just as I see him remove his shirt and running away from my home in the pouring rain.
I don't hear the door to my room open, I just stare into the night and at the spot where I last saw Ryder before he disappeared into the woods.
“Alice? You're awake.”
When I meet my mother's eyes she smiles warmly at me. “Yeah, I couldn't sleep.”
“You okay?” She looks at me with worry written on her face.
I turn away from the window to look at her. “Yeah, I'll be fine.”
“Well, I for one can't wait to lie down.”
I chuckle. “I bet it's been a long day for you.”
My mother shrugs. “It's what you sign up for if you wanna save lives, right?”
“Yeah, I guess.”
“How was the party? Did you have a nice time?”
I look back at the events of tonight and try to think of anything that did make it a good night, but I come up with absolutely nothing.
“It was okay. I didn't really stay there long.” “And Sam? Is she here or did she go home?” “She went home.”
“Oh, I thought she would've stayed here. I mean, she's always welcome to stay here. We've got plenty of room.”
I just nod. “I know.” “Okay, well goodnight.”
Just as my mother turns to leave my bedroom, I really want to ask her this one question.
“Mum?”
“Yes, honey.” She faces me with a tired look in her eyes but she still smiles.
“Do you know a woman who works at the hospital that has the surname Fields?”
She thinks for a few minutes while murmuring the surname to herself over and over again, then she shakes her head. “No.”
“Are you sure?”
She thinks for a little while then nods. “I'm absolutely positive. We have no one working at the hospital with that surname. I'm the person that's in charge of arranging the shifts, and I've never come across that name.”
My heart has already stopped beating as my mother confidently tells me that Max's mother does not work at the place like he said. I knew something was wrong the minute I saw him in that hospital chair and called his name to see an expression that looked a lot like he didn't want to be caught.
And now that I know the truth I can't help but think why he was there in the first place?
