“What?”
“For once Alice, please listen to me on this.”
I don't answer him. Instead I walk down the stairs, ignore the people still dancing and evacuate the house. I pass the empty campfire and carry on walking into the woods and end up at the clearing. I spot Max's black Range Rover straight away and see Kellan pacing in front of the bright headlights.
A couple of steps towards the Range Rover, Kellan stops pacing and rushes towards me.
“How's he doing?”
All Kellan does is run his hand through his hair. “He's in a really bad way and he's losing a lot of blood. If we don't treat him soon it's gonna get worse.”
“I'll take him to my house, it's much closer than the hospital. My mom won't be there and I'll use her spare medical kit.”
I make my way towards the driver's side to see Max lying in the backseat with his head resting on Sam's lap.
As soon as I reach for the handle it's pulled back by Kellan's hand. 'I'll drive.”
