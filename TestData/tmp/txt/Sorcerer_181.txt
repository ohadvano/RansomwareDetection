“Ferrans,” she said. 
“What?” Kiran said.
“We are ferrans,” said the j’bafofi. “We who are not human, but part human and part beast, are not simple-minded creatures. A monster is a mindless force of destruction, and beasts are just smart enough to be a human’s pet. Ferran are those on the same level of intelligence and social development as humans.”
Kiran turned to Gatril, confused and dumbfounded. Gatril herself seemed puzzled too, but she had a knowing air about her.
“Have you heard of this before?” said Kiran. Gatril turned her eyes away, but Kiran had already seen the thoughtful, knowing look in them. “What is it, Gatril?”
“You’re young, Kiran, so you wouldn’t know,” said Gatril. “Some beasts have started to form their own communities, even cities. Those in those places are starting a movement to organize the beasts into their own identity. Ferran comes from the word feral and human; meaning one as powerful as humans, yet untamed by humans.”
“R-Really?” said Kiran. The boy snatched up his bestiary and skipped through the pages. “I know they form clans but nothing as big as that!”
“That’s why I said not to trust books written by just humans,” said Gatril. “Humans have a tendency to permit only what’s beneficial to them to exist. You, spider, what is your name?”
“Shirksire,” she said. 
Gatril said, “Are you from one of these ferran cities, Shirksire?”
“Yes,” Shirksire said. “A long time ago I was exiled because of my belief that humans will never see me as equal. When I found this cave the town soon learned I was hear and tried to kill me. I defended myself—”
Kiran slapped the book shut, startling both women. Kiran put it down and looked at Shirksire testily. “That doesn’t give you the right to kill the entire town.”
“Don’t lecture me on morals, human!” Shirksire barked. “How many ferrans have you killed and skinned, beheaded and boiled down to the bone just to keep as your trophies? I only killed those who entered my cave to kill me. Their weapons are over there in the corner. The males caught wind of me here and did the rest. Besides…I doubt the entire town died. Probably some humans escaped. If the two of you can get past those idiot males, then there’s a good chance they did.”
Gatril turned to Kiran to see what his response would be. She didn’t want to tell him she mostly agreed with Shirksire; that she didn’t see anything wrong with killing and eating humans who came after them. But her interactions with Kiran and previous humans couldn’t fully make her accept the mindless killing of humans without reason.
However, her answer from Kiran was an unexpected one. He got up, took out his knife and began cutting the webs at Shirksire’s feet.
“What are you doing?” said Gatril, getting up with the gun in her hands.
“Showing her forgiveness,” said Kiran as he finished removing the webs from around Shirksire’s feet. “She doesn’t trust humans. But I’ll show her trust—Shirksire.”
The j’bafofi sat patiently while Kiran cut away her restraints. But she still didn’t move, courtesy of the gun aimed at her. When Kiran was finished, he went to Gatril and gestured for her to lower the gun.
“Are you sure about this Kiran?” Gatril said.
“…I haven’t been wrong yet,” said Kiran. He turned to Shirksire. “If you don’t trust me, you should at least trust another ferran…”
Shirksire waited on Gatril, and finally the bosdrake pointed the gun away from the j’bafofi. Shirksire slowly stood, flexing the stiffness out of her limbs. She looked down at the pair and said, “You are foolish for thinking you can make friends out of all your enemies, boy.”
“Are you my enemy?” said Kiran.
Shirksire sighed. “Fine…You win, human.”
Kiran smiled. “In that case…” He quickly pulled down his trouser and underwear and began stroking his penis. “Let’s get started…”
Shirksire flinched and backed away. “S-So soon?”
“What?” said Gatril. “You’ve never seen a penis before?”
Shirksire saw the quickly increasing size of Kiran’s cock and grew uneasy. “The males…they do not have one so…thick…”
Kiran chuckled. “Don’t worry, it won’t do you anything much.” Now Kiran was fully erect and bobbing with the pulsing blood flow.
Still uneasy, Shirksire said, “How would we begin…?”
“On your knees and suck it,” said Gatril. 
“Y-You mean…in my mouth?” said Shirksire.
“Of course.” Gatril approached Shirksire and yanked on one of her arms. “The sooner you do it, the quicker you’ll get use to it. Now come on. This is great trust building.”
Shirksire reluctantly stooped, now eye-level with Kiran. She took his warm member and gently stroked it. “I swear, human. If you ever double-cross me I’ll eat you alive.”
“You’re about to do it anyways,” said Kiran.
Shirksire understood the joke too clearly and bit her lip in embarrassment. “Damn human…”
