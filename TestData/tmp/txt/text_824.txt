It takes me half an hour to drive home, and when it comes into view, I let out a sigh of relief. I stop the car and rest my head against the steering wheel. I stay in that position for a few minutes to steady my heart and breathing.
I turn my head to look at the house and notice that the front door has been left open.
Why would my mother leave the door wide open?
I exit the car and run to the doorway but stop when I see the house in complete disarray.
“Mum?”
I wait for her response but not even a sound is to be heard inside the house. I check outside to see if her car is there and frown when I see her car parked in the driveway.
Where did she go?
I worryingly walk inside the house and enter the living area when I suddenly slide on something on the floor. I lower my head and immediately start to feel nauseous when I see a trail of footprints covered in blood, leading out into the garden, additionally I start to think the worst.
“Mum!?” I yell.
