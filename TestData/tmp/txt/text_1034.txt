Ryder says nothing other than opens the shower door.
I bring my knees closer to my chest. He's seen me in this state more than once, I can't bring myself to ask him to leave after all he's done for me.
Ryder comes to sit next to me with his legs stretched in front of him. “Don't ever apologise when it's not your fault.”
I look at him. “But it is my fault, I should've been more careful, or at least hid somewhere in the forest and out of sight.”
Ryder shakes his head. “It's their fault for trespassing on private property. Stop blaming yourself, Alice. They shouldn't have been there in the first place.” A moment of silence passes.
“Ryder, I have to tell you something.” “What is it?”
“It's about Max.”
Ryder tenses his jaw and nods.
I clear my throat. “When Max came to school on his first day, we talked about stuff, and he told me something about his mum that I found out was a lie.”
