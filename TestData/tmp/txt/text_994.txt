I look around me to see people leaving to go inside the house to probably carry on with the party.
I can't believe that not one person stopped the fight. Why is it that a fight is seen as entertainment? People get severely hurt and for what? To show who's bigger or stronger? Who does Ryder think he is?
“Sam!” I call her name from my position next to Max.
The moment she comes over she gasps in horror at the sight in front of her. “Alice!?”
“Can you help me carry Max to his car please?”
I get up and ready myself to pick Max's beaten body off the floor when I hear Kellan call out my name from behind me. “Here let me.”
I watch as Kellan picks up Max effortlessly off the floor, and leads him into the forest and out to where his car is.
“Are you coming?” Sam stops in her tracks when she realizes that I'm not following her.
“You go ahead with Kellan. I'll be right behind you guys.”
