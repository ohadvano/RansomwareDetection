
vegetable fast I highly recommend. Proper fasting can do a lot in helping with one's health;

but improper fasting can be harmful to one's health. A normal person can fast one to three

days on only distil ed water without any injury and it wil be quite beneficial both spiritual y

and physical y to one's health. If you fast on water only for more than three days, then you

are living on the broken down tissues in your body which produces an acid reaction. This

thickens the blood; and with a high concentration of poisons in the bloodstream, puts a

burden on the heart, arteries, kidneys, liver, lungs, etc.

We can help this cleansing process by eating lots of fresh raw vegetables and fruits

as most are alkaline forming and wil increase the healing effect of fasting as elimination of

uric acid and other inorganic acids wil be accelerated. The vitamins, minerals, enzymes

and trace elements of raw vegetables and fruits are important in supplying needed

elements for the body's own healing.

Fasting in Europe is practiced on a grand scale. There are hundreds of clinics in

Germany alone where fasting is a number one method of healing. Al of them use juice

fasting exclusively. I believe that juice fasting is preferable to water fasting, but that the

whole fruit or vegetable fast is preferable to a juice fast. Which is more natural, the orange

or orange juice? He would have put a lid on top of the orange. When you use juice

instead of the whole food, while you are fasting, you wil have problems with elimination as

there is no fiber or bulk in juice.

FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLESS: FAST CLEANSES THE BODY

It is wel to know the process your body goes through in the course of a fast. The

first three days are usual y the most difficult in terms of hunger pains. By the fourth day the

hunger pains are beginning to subside, though you wil have feelings of weakness and

occasional dizziness. During a prolonged fast (after the first three days) your body wil live

on its own substance. When it is deprived of needed nutrition such as proteins and fats, it

wil burn and digest its own tissues. But your body wil not do it indiscriminately -and here

lies the secret of the effectiveness of fasting -your body wil first decompose and burn

those cel s and tissues which are diseased, damaged, aged, or dead.



In fasting, your body feeds itself on the most impure and inferior materials such as

tumors, abscesses, fat deposits, etc. Dr. Otto Buchanan, M.D. (one of the greatest fasting

authorities in the world) cal s fasting -very pertinently - a "refuse disposal", a "burning of

rubbish". During fasting, while the old cel s and diseased tissues are decomposed and

burned, the building of new healthy cel s is speeded up. This eliminative process is

evidenced by some of the fol owing typical symptoms: offensive breath, dark urine, skin

eruptions, excessive perspiration, catarrhal eliminations of mucus, and headaches. Do not

be disturbed by those symptoms; rather, be grateful for the increased health and wel -

being that wil result.

By the ninth or tenth day of a longer fast, the body wil normal y have eliminated the

bulk of toxic poisons and you wil start feeling great. Your sense of concentration wil be

greater, and you wil feel as if you could continue fasting indefinitely as you are not

hungry. Your fast can last as long as you like (it could go on for weeks as it depends upon

how much fresh fruit and vegetables you are eating), but it must end when your hunger

pains return. This is the signal that the body has used up al its excess reserves. The fast

should be broken at this time.





ADDITIONAL TIPS ON FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLE FAST

Do not drink with meals, and do not mix fruits and vegetables at the same meal. Eat

only fresh fruits and vegetables, nothing cooked or dried. Eat no more than twice a day at

a regular time each day, and nothing between meals, except water or herb tea. One must

drink a minimum of two quarts of distil ed water daily; more is better. Bathing once or twice

daily is also beneficial, as one third of al body impurities and wastes are eliminated

through the skin. Do lots of deep breathing of outside air. Red clover tea is a very good

herb to take while one is on a fast. It is an excel ent blood purifier and wil help your body

detoxify. Drink it as often as you like.

FEVERS





The normal temperature taken oral y is 98.6Â° F.

However, it may be within the range of normal if it is one

degree above or two degrees below this value. When an

individual comes down with a fever, their body is trying to tel

them something is wrong.



Fever happens to be a defense strategy employed by

the body that helps to destroy bacteria and viruses that have

gotten out of hand. Bacteria and viral microbes live normal y

and natural y inside of human beings. They co-exist with us,

around us and inside us, and when our body's immune

system is working properly, these microbes cause us little

concern. In fact, many scientists have demonstrated that

these microbes are often important to our inner functioning

and biochemical existence. Our body's own innate ability to

keep bacteria and viruses in check inside of us via our immune system is the best way to

stay wel . Our bodies contain over seventy thousand tril ion cel s that al make their own

chemicals. They make them in the right quantities and there are no il side effects. When a

person does get a fever it is the body's natural way of destroying bacteria and viruses.

These bacteria and viruses find it extremely difficult to sustain their existence in higher

temperature ranges, and so the body's immune system causes the fever to kil off the

microbes.



Thus, when our body has a fever, it is not good to lower the fever as this wil hinder

the body from doing its job of getting rid of the problems causing the fever.

What we need to do is help our body by raising our temperature. Many years ago

when someone had a fever, they would put them to bee cover them up with lots of

blankets, and eve put hot water bottles on their feet. They would also give the individual

large amounts of put soft water to drink. After a time the fever would break and the person

was on their way to recovery.



ISN'T TOO HIGH A FEVER DANGEROUS?



Conventional medicine spends most of its time treating symptoms or signs of

disease instead of treating the disease. For example, when one has a fever and goes to

the doctor h is given medication, such as aspirin, to lower the fever. By lowering the fever

by chemical y introducing a drug, the medical profession is not treating the disease but

instead only addressing the symptom. Medicine as a profession ha taught us that it is

beneficial to lower the fever whereas, in reality, this wil cause harm to the body. By

lowering the fever artificial y this prevents the immune system from doing the job is

supposed to do, thus the person gets sicker 2 the microbes increase.



As long as the temperature is below 105Â° F, it wil not cause harm or brain damage

to normal person. When I worked at a hospital in Central America we had patients come in

with malaria who had high temperatures and it didnâ€™t cause brain damage.



108





IS THERE A NATURAL WAY TO LOWER A FEVER?

If a person's temperature goes over 105Â° make sure they are drinking plenty of

water. If they are drinking the water and their temperature is stil over 105Â° F. then the best

way to lower the fever is by putting them into a ful bath tub of water that is around 98Â° -

100Â° F. Never put them into ice water or cold water. This wil cause most of the blood from

the legs and arms to go to the trunk of the body and wil hinder circulation and be

detrimental.



WHAT ELSE SHOULD BE DONE FOR A HIGH FEVER?

As long as the fever is below 105Â° F. let it take its course. Give plenty of water as

mentioned earlier. If they want to eat give them only fresh fruit. Make sure they are

comfortable and in quiet surroundings. Be sure they have plenty of fresh air and sunshine,

and that they bathe everyday. Most fevers are of a rather short duration, but occasional y

they can last for a longer period of time. The human body is the greatest doctor alive.

When one has a fever, help the fever to do its job natural y.

FOODS - ACID AND ALKALINE





Al food, as they are digested or burned, leave an ash in the body. This ash can be

neutral, acid or alkaline, depending on the mineral composition of the food. The acid ash

(acidosis) results when there is a depletion of the alkaline ash. In the healing of sickness,

the higher the ratio of alkaline forming foods in the diet, the faster wil be the recovery.

Alkalis neutralize the acids. Al the minerals that make up the red blood cel s and the blood

plasma are alkaline, except for chlorine which is acid. There are other important fluids in

the body which are alkaline. Some of these are saliva, bile, tears, lymph, joint lubricant,

muscle lubricant, colon secretion and pancreatic juice. None of the alkaline juices are

body wastes, though the bile contains waste. Some body fluids that are acidic are urine,

perspiration, fluid emitted during expiration, fatigue wastes and gastric juice. Al of these

fluids are body wastes except for the gastric juice, which is used for digestion. It is

important to realize that the body fluids which contribute to the life processes are al

alkaline except the gastric juice and that the waste fluids are al acid. The acid products

must be eliminated because the healthy state of the body is one of alkalinity. If the tissues

of the body become acid to the slightest degree, serious il ness occurs and death can

result.

The degree of acidity or alkalinity of a substance is expressed in pH values, the "p"

indicates the potency, while the "H" is for hydrogen ions which is the name the chemist

gives to the particular element constituting the acid. The scale ranges from 0 (acid) to 14

(alkaline), with 7 being neutral, neither acid nor alkaline.

Normal blood is slightly alkaline, just above neutral, having a pH of 7.35. If the pH

of a person's blood reaches higher than 7.8 or fal s below 7.22, immediate death occurs. A

condition known as acidosis occurs when the pH of the blood drops below 7.35. If the

blood rises above the normal 7.35, alkalosis exists and grows more severe, until death

occurs when the pH reaches 7.8. This provides a variable range of only about .6 of a

degree. Disease occurs any time the blood does not have a normal pH of 7.35.

The more acid the fluids and tissues of the body become the more subject they are

to the growth of bacteria and germs, and the less able they are to combat them. It is now

known that acid-forming foods increase the excretion of calcium and phosphorus from the

body (causing osteoporosis) and that alkaline-forming foods tend toward a greater

retention of these mineral salts in the body. Kidney stones are sometimes concentrations

of uric acid crystals which are more apt to form when the urine is too acidic. A more

alkaline urine tends to dissolve them. A burning sensation can develop when the urine

becomes very acidic. By drinking large amounts of distil ed water one can speed the

process of acid elimination through the pores and kidneys. The pH of urine can be

changed in just a few hours.



110



The skin is provided with approximately 1,500,000 sweat glands, excreting

perspiration, which is acidic. The lungs give off carbonic acid gas which is released as

carbon dioxide and water. The burning of food and oxygen in the body cel s produces this

gas which is taken by lymph and blood to the lungs to be exhaled.

More processes of life are aided by alkaline fluids than acid. Both are necessary.

Alkalis are continual y being consumed and the supply depleted. Since they are

continual y being consumed, there is the danger that the supply wil be exhausted. It is

very plain then, that if foods wil influence the alkalinity and acidity of the body we need to

eat abundantly of that which wil keep the alkalinity of the body high, and eat sparingly of

foods which wil increase its acidity. The ideal ratio according to Dr. Roger Berg, the

world's foremost authority on the relationship between the acid-alkaline ratio in the diet, is

about 80% alkaline producing foods and 20% acid producing foods. The correct pH

balance of our blood can be maintained by choosing careful y the foods one eats. Another

factor, which influences the correct balance, is the ability of the kidneys, skin pores and

lungs to eliminate acids. It is important that these organs function properly.

Harmful acids that we should avoid are: acetic acid found in vinegar; tannic acid

found in coffee, tea and cocoa; and benzoic acid found in food preservatives. Foods that

are acid in themselves such as citrus, when digested and assimilated by the body leave

an alkaline residue, while alkaline foods leave an acid residue. Therefore, we refer to the

foods as either acid forming, or alkaline forming.

Studies have also confirmed that rest, exercise, fresh air, laughter and love are

alkalizers of the body; selfishness, anger, worry and hatred are acidifiers of the body.

FRESH FOOD IS BEST



In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve ate only fresh

fruits, nuts and grains. Eve didn't use a stove or microwave to

prepare Adam's meals. For one to have good health, a

minimum of 50% of our daily food intake should be raw foods.

Raw food is live food; cooked food is dead food. Have you

noticed how few fresh raw fruits and vegetables the average

person consumes?



Food processing, refining, cooking, and more recently,

the advent of microwaving, destroys the enzymes in the live

food we eat. These enzyme deficient foods cause imbalances

in our bodies, which in turn cause disease.



The biggest difference between live (raw) food and dead

(cooked) food is enzymatic activity and something I cal the life force. If you were to take

two seeds, boil one of them, and then put them both in the ground, which one do you think

would grow? The unboiled one would grow because the enzymes and the life force are

stil alive. Cooking stops enzymatic action and destroys the life force.



Enzymes are said to be protein molecules, and each enzyme acts in certain ways

in the body, doing specific jobs. Enzymes digest al our food. There are over 100,000

enzyme particles in a single drop of blood. They take digested food and build it into blood,

nerves, muscles, and glands. Enzymes assist in storing sugar in the liver and muscles.

There is an enzyme that builds phosphorus into bone and nerve tissue. Once we cook

food above 118 degrees, al the enzymes present in the food are completely destroyed,

and are no longer able to perform their designated function. Although the physical protein

molecule is stil present, it has lost its life force. Like a flashlight battery that has lost its

power, the physical structure remains, but the electrical energy is no longer present.



A protein molecule is actual y only the carrier of enzyme activity. In experiments

described in "Chemical Review", the activity of our protein molecule was transferred over

to another protein substance, leaving the original molecule devoid of its original activity(1).

This only proves further that an enzyme is the invisible activity or energy factor, and not

just the protein molecule itself.



Enzymes are needed for every chemical action and reaction in the body. Our

organs, tissues, and cel s are al run by metabolic enzymes. Minerals, vitamins, and

hormones need enzymes to be present in order to do their work properly. Enzymes are

the labor force of the body. Enzymes are involved in every metabolic process our immune

system, blood stream, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, etc.. Enzymes break down toxic

substances so that the body can eliminate them without damaging the eliminative

organs(2). Since 1968, thirteen hundred enzymes have been identified.

A diet high in cooked food lacks the enzymes that are in fresh food, and causes the

endocrine glands to become overworked, thus encouraging the development of diseases

such as hypoglycemia and obesity.

Enzymes may be divided into two groups, those found in raw food, and those

produced within our bodies. The more enzymes one gets from the raw food, the less that

wil have to be borrowed from other metabolic processes and supplied by the pancreas. It



112

is important to realize that the enzymes in raw food actual y digest 50% to 75% of the food

itself without the help of the enzymes secreted by the body. Nature has placed enzymes in

food to aid in the digestive process instead of forcing the body's enzymes to do al the

work. It is to be remembered that we inherited an enzyme reserve at birth, and this

quantity can be decreased as we age by eating an enzyme deficient diet. By eating most

of our food cooked, our digestive system has to produce al of the enzymes, thus causing

an enlargement of the digestive organs, especial y the pancreas. It also places a drain on

the body's immune system.

An experiment was performed at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago in relation to

saliva and its enzyme content. The younger group (aged 21 to 31) was found to have 30

times more amylase (an enzyme) in their saliva than those in the older group (aged over

69).(3)

In conclusion, this information is tel ing us that we need to eat more fresh fruits and

vegetables. Our diet should consist of at least 50% fresh food. We should eat our fresh

salads, etc., at the beginning of our meal. They are bulky and wil give us a more ful

feeling, helping us not to overeat cooked food. As one gets older, the intake of fresh food

should be increased to even more than 50%, since our bodies are more deficient of

enzymes. Investigations show that in warm temperatures, enzymes are used up more

rapidly than in cool temperatures. Additional fresh foods are therefore needed during the

summer months, and for those who live in the southern United States.

HEADACHES





There are many different types of headaches: tension headaches, migraine headaches,

al ergic headaches, etc. One may have a mild or severe headache, or the pain may be

frontal or toward the back of the head. It may be a dul aching pain, or an almost

unbearable pain. It may be an intermittent intense pain, a throbbing pain, a pressure pain,

or a penetrating pain.

A headache is not a disease, but a symptom, showing that something else is

wrong in the body and needs to be taken care of. A headache is like the red engine

warning light on the dashboard of your car. If you ignore the warning light when it comes

on, you won't get very far down the road before your car engine wil stop running. If you

ignore a headache,(which is a built-in warning device), your body wil also stop functioning

properly.



When a person has a headache his body is trying to tel him that something is

wrong. He may be constipated, or not getting enough sleep, or eating the wrong kind of

foods, or under too much stress, or not drinking enough water, or breathing poisonous air,

or taking the wrong medications, etc. It is sometimes hard to find the cause of headaches,

so one needs to look

very careful y at his lifestyle and be wil ing to make any necessary changes.



Monosodium glutamate (MSG) may also cause headaches in sensitive individuals.

Many who read food labels are unaware that MSG may be listed as "flavoring," "natural

flavoring," or hydrolized vegetable protein." Hydrolyzed vegetable protein may be 10-30%

MSG. (Headache 31:107-110, 1991)

Three of the major causes of headaches are constipation, dehydration, and stress.

When one is constipated, the waste material in the colon spoils and becomes putrefied

from being in the body too long. The blood capil aries to the colon begin to pick up the

toxins and poisons that are in the colon. These enter the blood stream (causing many



114

problems), and are carried to al parts of the body, including the brain where one develops

a headache. Two factors that wil improve constipation are drinking plenty of water, and

eating natural foods. Leave refined concentrated foods alone (there is no food more

constipating than cheese).

Not drinking enough water is another major cause of headaches. The human brain

is composed of over 80% water, and when a person doesn't drink enough water, they wil

have headaches. Everyone should drink at least two quarts of water daily. Stress is

another major cause of tension headaches. Two physical things we can do for tension

headaches are soaking in a bathtub of lukewarm water for a half hour, and drinking red

sage tea, which is excel ent for tension headaches.



Some other simple ways to relieve headaches are to take a hot foot bath with plain

water or with a tablespoon of mustard seed in it, and place a cold compress to the head

for 20 minutes. Two other herb teas that are good for headaches are peppermint and

black cohosh. Black cohosh is especial y good for severe headaches and congestion in

the head

In conclusion, remember that headaches are merely the body's warning signal that

something is wrong. Living natural y and healthful y, and learning to take handle our

burdens wil eliminate many of the stressful situations in our lives, and help us to deal with

those that do come in a calm way that wil minimize headaches.

HEART DISEASE





There are over 4,000 heart attacks every day in America. 50% of al deaths in the

U.S. are from cardiovascular disease. That is a ratio of 1 out of every 2 Americans.



No machine made by man is as durable or efficient as the

human heart. Although it is about the size of your two fists and

weighs only half a pound, every day it pumps several tons of

blood through over 60,000 miles of blood vessels. It is almost

beyond belief, the amount of work this smal but powerful organ

wil do in one day. At its normal rate of speed, the human heart

beats about seventy times a minute. This amounts to more than

100,000 contractions in one day, or thirty seven mil ion in one

year. Truly, our bodies are fearful y and wonderful y made.



What is the major cause of heart disease? DIET! Heart

disease is largely self-induced by the way we live. Smoking,

drinking alcohol, coffee, and tea, eating too much salt, and eating

refined foods are al harmful to your heart. Only industrialized

societies like ours can afford diets that are rich in meat, dairy products, eggs, fat, and

processed food products such as oils (corn oil, margarine, etc.) which are high in fat. In

America, 40% to 45% of the calories we eat come from fats. Ideal y, fat should make up

only 10% of our diet.

The ideal diet for someone with heart disease would be a low fat diet high in fresh

fruits and vegetables. A pure vegetarian diet, using no meat, dairy products, or eggs is

optimum. Meat and dairy products average 50% to 85% of their calories as fat. Some

dairy products are as high as 90% fat. See accompanying chart.

100%



Our bodies need some fat and it is best to get our fat from a natural source, not a

refined source. An example of a natural fat is an avocado. Natural fats can also be found

in nuts and seeds. An example of a refined or unnatural fat is corn oil, which is 100% fat.



116

It takes 12-14 ears of corn to produce one tablespoon of oil. And, ounce for ounce, fats

have over twice as many calories as sugar.



CHOLESTEROL AND HEART DISEASE



Cholesterol is a substance that can only be found in meat, poultry, and animal

products such as eggs, (3 egggs have as much cholesterol as 2 lbs. of hamburger) milk,

cheese, etc. Foods from the plant kingdom, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, etc.

do not contain any cholesterol. There are two types of cholesterol: High density

Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is the good kind that our body produces. The other is Low

Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which is the undesirable kind. Meats, animal

products, refined shortening, and oil (even though they themselves are cholesterol free)

are the foods most responsible for creating high cholesterol levels in our bodies.

Exercise is important for those who have heart disease, and also for those who

want to prevent heart disease. A daily walking program, outside in the fresh air and

sunshine, is very beneficial. Spas, gymnasiums, and work-out rooms are not

advantageous. Fresh air and sunshine, which are very important, are lacking in such

places. Those who are engaged in sedentary work, especial y, need more physical

outdoor exercise.

Several prescription drugs used to lower cholesterol have proven to be more

dangerous than therapeutic. As a result of the six-year Coronary Drug Project conducted

by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and published in 1975, two of the then commonly

prescribed drugs were abruptly taken off the market when the study showed that more

people died in the group taking the drugs than in the group taking a placebo(1).

There are many herbs that are good for the heart. Some of these are Blue Cohosh

(for heart palpitation), Borage, and Hawthorne Berry (to strengthen the heart). Always use

distil ed water when making herb tea. Bring water to a boil, remove from heat and add 1-2

tsp. herb per 8 oz of water. Cover and let steep for 20 minutes. Strain and drink.

HERBS





The great remedial properties of herbs have been recognized and appreciated

since time immemorial. Herbs were mentioned in the Bible from the beginning of creation.

Herbs are nature's medicine and have been put here by an al -wise Creator. See Psalm

104:141 and Ezekiel 47:12. There is an herb for every disease that a human body can be

afflicted with (mankind just does not know them al ).

The father of medicine, Hipprocates, was an herbalist. Herbs were used extensively

until about 1500 A.D. At that time a man by the name of Hohemhein started the practice of

using chemicals for the treatment of disease. Hohemhein burned in the public square al

the herb books of Hippocrates. Having this valuable information out of the way, the

medicine men fol owed the error of Hohemhein, who was the first to give the damaging

drug Mercury.

In public, the medical establishment puts down herbs as quackery. What hypocrisy!

What no one ever tel s you is that some of today's biggest drug companies such as E. I.

Lil y, Squibb, and Parke Davis started out sel ing herbs. E. I. Lil y himself started out

picking flowers and herbs by the side of the road. His one formula with the herb cascara

sagrada earned him enough money to launch his company.

Today, things are changing again - but it's happening quietly and no one is talking

about it too much. Did you know that in a recent year, over 130 mil ion prescription drugs

were written which came from plants? Or that over 75% of the hormones used in medicine

today are derived completely from plants.

In private, the drug companies are some of the biggest users of herbal research

libraries. That's what a head librarian told a fel ow researcher. He said the drug companies

were looking for old forgotten formulas for which they can get "grandfather" rights.

According to my understanding, "grandfather rights" means that the formula was

used before a certain date in the early 1900's for a certain disease. Then, under certain

conditions, a drug company could sel the same formula today - without having to spend

$50 to $200 mil ion to get it approved by the government.

You see one big reason - $$$$$ - why the drug companies might be interested in

old-time herbal formulas.

Drugs erode the general state of one's health. "It is known that about 40 percent of

people undergoing medical care suffer side effects from the medications given them, and



118

these reactions can leave a person "blind or deaf, afflicted with kidney, liver or brain

damage, bone necrosis, ulceration of the bowel, intestinal hemorrhage, skin scars,

extreme sensitivity to sunlight or other disabilities that may last for months or years(1).

You may be surprised to learn that even today over forty percent of prescription

drugs sold in the U. S. contain ingredients derived from nature; and a ful twenty-five

percent of drugs contain at least one compound derived directly or through chemical

modeling, from flowering plants.



Rules For Using Herbs

When you are sick - use herbs. When you are wel , leave them alone. A person

doesn't take medicine when he is wel , neither should you take herbs when you are wel ,

as they can throw the body off balance. Herbs can be taken internal y in different ways:

capsules, tinctures and tea form. The very best way is in tea form, as most al capsules

are made from gelatin which comes from an animal by-product. Tinctures are very

concentrated and have alcohol in them for a preservative. When you make your tea,

always use distil ed water or reverse osmosis filtered water as it wil absorb more of the

medicinal properties out of the herb than any other type of water. When using the leaves

or flowers of the herb, bring the water to a boil; remove from the heat and add the herb.

Let it steep for 20 minutes or longer, then strain and drink it. When using the part (???) or

bark you need to boil them for 30 â€“ 40 minutes then can strain and use. As a general rule

you would put one to two teaspoons of herb per eight ounces of water. It is best not to

mix/two herbs together at one time, as you have an interaction of the herbs with one

another. If you mix six herbs together just imagine how many different combinations you

can come up with! It would be the same as taking six numbers and seeing how many

ways you can write them down. If I'm using two herbs, they should each be made

separately and taken at different times. There are many poisonous herbs, which we would

never want to use and there are some herbs that have side effects, and need to be used

with discretion. W^ can never be too careful in our use of herbs.

There are many herbal books on the market that one can purchase. Of course, you

wil find many contradictions (as you do in any field). A safe rule of thumb is to buy 4 or 5

herbal books; look up the herb you are thinking about using in each one. If they al agree,

then try it. A great herbal book in print today that I would recommend is Medicinal Plants

(1990) by Steven Foster and Dr. James A. Duke, Houghton-Mifflin Company, Boston. This

book is authored by two individuals - an herbalist and a scientist.

Listed here are just a smal portion of herbs and some of their uses that I have

personal y used and seen results with. According to the World Health Organization, as

much as eighty percent of the world's population stil relies on traditional forms of medicine

such as herbs. Only those who know the value of herbal remedies can appreciate the

wonderful effects of the herbs that many tread under foot daily.
