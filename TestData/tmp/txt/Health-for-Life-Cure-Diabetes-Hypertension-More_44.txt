MINERALS OUR BODY NEEDS





The average person's body is composed of nearly 70% water, plus compounds including

vitamins, enzymes, hormones, and trace minerals, the balance of which is important to

proper functioning of the body. By elements, the adult body consists of 65% oxygen, 18%

carbon, 10% hydrogen, 3% nitrogen, 1.5% calcium, 1% phosphorus, and 1.5% other

elements.

There are 21 essential mineral elements necessary for the human body. The

ground on which we walk contain these same minerals. The difference is that in the

ground they are in the inorganic form, and in our bodies they are in the organic form. Man

cannot utilize the inorganic form found in the ground. When we eat fruits, vegetables, nuts,

and grains, we get the organic minerals. But man cannot eat clay and live, even if it has al

of the necessary minerals, because they are in the inorganic form. This also holds true for

our drinking water, as it contains inorganic minerals which our bodies cannot assimilate.

The best water for drinking is distil ed water (rain water is also distil ed water). In this

chapter we are going to take a look at each one of these 21 organic minerals that our

body needs, tel how they help our bodies, and what natural foods contain these minerals.

CALCIUM is one of the most important minerals in the body for building the bones

and teeth. It soothes the nerves thus decreasing nervousness. Calcium contracts the

heart and is needed for the contraction of al muscles. Calcium is required for the complex

processes of blood coagulation. Some natural food sources high in calcium are black

strap molasses, almonds, oranges, and most greens such as kale, turnip, col ards, etc.

CHLORINE is a trace mineral which is needed in very smal amounts. Its main

function is acting as a part of the hydrochloric acid produced in the stomach for digesting

proteins. It is found in kale, beets, radishes, rye flour, coconuts, tomatoes, and ripe olives.

CHROMIUM is a trace mineral, and its main function is to aid in the synthesization

of fatty acids. Those who have problems with low blood sugar or diabetes should eat lots

of natural whole grains, as this trace mineral is lost in the refining processes of our food.

COBALT is a trace mineral, the body needs in very minute amounts. It is an

essential element in vitamin B12. Cobalt stimulates the production of red cel s. It is found

in Kelp and al green leafy vegetables.

COPPER is a trace mineral element found in al tissues of the body. An excess can

be dangerous and cause insanity. Recent studies done by Dr. Oscar Roth of Yale

University School of Medicine revealed serum copper is high with use of birth control pil s.

Copper is needed for skin and hair pigmentation, for bone formation, and in the production

of red blood cel s. Some foods that contain copper are wheat germ, nuts, honey, raisins,

soy beans, and oats.

FLUORINE is another trace element that the body needs. It exists in the body in

compounds cal ed fluorides. Its action is to strengthen the bones, and it acts strongly on

the spleen, the teeth, and the enamel of the teeth. Foods containing fluorine are cabbage,

cauliflower, avocados, tomatoes, watercress, etc.. Note: The sodium fluoride that is added

to our water supply is not natural and does much harm to our bodies.



144

IODINE is a trace mineral. Iodine is the thyroid gland's favorite nutrient and helps

regulate the body's metabolism and sodium-potassium ratio balance. Major symptoms of

iodine deficiency are feeling cold, being tired, prone to gain weight, painful menstruation,

and poor memory. Some food sources of iodine are kelp, sea salt, sunflower seeds, turnip

greens, and cantaloupe.



IRON is a mineral that aids in the production of hemoglobin and aids the red cel s in

carrying oxygen to the tissues. It supplies energy and vitality, nourishes the tissues from

the blood stream, aids in resistance to disease, and in the growth of children. The highest

food source of iron is blackstrap molasses (3 times higher than liver). Other sources of

iron are almonds, kelp, lentils, oats, raisins, and whole wheat flour.



MANGANESE is a mineral needed for the glandular system, such as the pituitary

gland, pancreas, liver, and kidneys. It acts upon the nervous system, and aids in muscle

coordination. Epilepsy, uncontrol able muscle convulsions, and their accompanying

blackouts, seem to result from manganese deficiency. Food sources of manganese are

buckwheat, oats, barley, brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, peas, beans, almonds, and brown

rice.

MAGNESIUM is one of the most important minerals next to calcium. Magnesium

helps in the metabolizing of calcium and Vitamin C. It regulates nervous irritability and

muscle contractions. Nuts and cereal grains are especial y rich in magnesium.

MOLYBDENUM is a trace mineral which assists in the metabolizing of iron which

has been stored in the liver. It also helps in converting nitrogen, left over from the

digestion of protein, into uric acid. It then travels to the kidneys and is discharged through

the urine. Natural food sources of molybdenum are soybeans, peas, honey, whole rye and

wheat, squash, vegetables, blackstrap molasses, sea salt, and fruits.

NICKEL is another of the trace-mineral elements, but the role it plays in the human

body is not clear. The main food source for nickel is found in vegetables.

PHOSPHORUS performs more functions in the body than any other mineral.

Approximately 80% is in the bones, and 20% is found in the tissues. It is closely related

with calcium, and is therefore found in the bones, teeth, muscle, and brain. It is needed for

nerve tissue, especial y the heart. Some natural food sources for phosphorus are whole

grains, seeds, and nuts. Many processed foods and soft drinks contain added

phosphates; these are harmful and should not be used.

POTASSIUM helps the body keep a proper acid-alkaline balance. It is essential for

muscle contractions, therefore, it is vital to proper heart function, especial y the normal

heart beat. Some natural food sources are al green leafy vegetables, oranges, whole

grains, nuts, and bananas.

SELENIUM is an anti-oxidant, which helps prevent the hemoglobin in red blood

cel s from being damaged by oxidation. Some natural food sources are kelp, garlic, grains,

and most vegetables.



SILICON is essential for building strong bones, and for the normal growth of hair,

nails, and teeth. It is beneficial in al healing processes, and protects the body against

many diseases. Some natural food sources are fruits, particularly apples, whole grains,

beets, onions, parsnips, and almonds.



SODIUM has a special function in the body to prevent clotting of the blood, to

stimulate the spleen, to regulate heat in body fluids, to neutralize acid, and relax the heart

muscle as wel as other muscles in the body. Sodium, as an organic mineral does not

present any problem to the body if used in moderation; but sodium chloride (common

table salt) the inorganic form, can cause problems such as fluid retention, kidney damage,

heart problems, high blood pressure, etc.. Some natural food sources are kelp, celery,

romaine lettuce, watermelon, and sea salt.



145





SULPHUR is found in every cel of the body. The cel s that contain most of the sulphur are

those of the skin, hair, and joints. That is why it is sometimes cal ed the beauty mineral.

Some natural food sources are radishes, turnips, onions, celery, string beans, kale,

watercress, and soybeans.



TIN is needed for the human body, but little more than this is presently known. This

trace mineral element is found in al vegetation growing on soil that is not depleted of tin.



VANADIUM is also a trace mineral that the human body needs, but little more than

this is presently known Natural food sources are whole unrefined grains.

ZINC is needed for the brain, the retina of the eye, and the visual process, as wel

as for normal growth, especial y of the bones. It is also needed for the development of the

sex organs, and for the normal function of the prostrate gland. A zinc deficiency leads to a

diminished sensitivity to taste and smel . Some natural food sources are pumpkin seeds,

sunflower seeds, nuts and green leafy vegetables.

Thus we have taken a look at the 21 minerals our body must have in order to

function properly. Have you noticed how each one of these minerals can be found in the

natural foods God has given us to eat? I want to encourage you to get your minerals from

the natural food as grown, and not in any supplemental form. Vitamin or mineral

supplements are not natural. The synthetic ones are chemicals; and the ones derived from

the plant itself are refined in the sense that they are separated from the rest of the

vitamins, minerals, and enzymes that were in the plant from the beginning.

If the good Lord would have wanted us to take a calcium pil , He would have

created a tree that grew calcium pil s. Instead, He created the almond tree, orange tree,

etc. to grow almonds and oranges, which are high in calcium.

MENOPAUSE



Menopause, (mono meaning month and pause meaning cessation), also referred to

as "change of life." is a natural progression of aging instead of some kind of disease or

hormonal malfunction. It is the time when women stop ovulating.

Menopause usual y occurs between 35 and 58 years of age. The menses may stop

suddenly, there may be a decreased flow each month until there is a final cessation, or the

interval between periods may be lengthened until complete cessation is accomplished.
