“…Yeah,” he said. He handed her the basket. 
Gatril took it and flung the top open. “Hmmm, pork,” she said, the fragrance immediately watering her mouth. 
“We better leave fun time for tomorrow night,” said Kiran. “We’ll need all our strength against the popobawa. I’ll sleep out here with you tonight just to make sure we’re safe.”
“I told you already, I don’t need your company,” said Gatril.
“It’s not up for discussion.” Kiran crept into the nest and carefully placed the lantern in the center of the floor of matted leaves. He put his knapsack in the corner along with Gatril’s small items.
“Excuse me,” said Aparna. “What do you two mean by, funtime?”
Gatril swallowed the piece of meat in her mouth and said, “Sex.”
“…I see,” said Aparna. “You two seem to have quiet the relationship.”
“We’re just friends with benefits,” said Gatril.
Aparna made a lopsided grin. “He’s a really good friend to be staying out here around predators with a dragon.”
Aparna’s words slipped into Gatril’s ears like a salted worm, wriggling about and stirring up unwanted thoughts—thoughts she didn’t want to entertain. “He’s a good human. That’s why I’m following him. Now are you going to come inside or not?”
“I’ll head back to the inn,” said Aparna, a slick smile on her lips.
“Good,” said Gatril. “Now go away and leave me and my friend alone.”
Aparna chuckled and made her way back to the town.
The following evening, Kiran went back in town to pick up fuel for his quacycle, and on his way out he fetched Aparna. He returned with her to Gatril’s hut, getting her to add the final piece to his party. The trio rode around town, testing the limits of the single large seat with the women behind Kiran; Gatril in the center. As a result, their weight made their pace slow, but they had intended to pay keen attention to their surroundings.
Along with the lantern Kiran had placed at the front of his vehicle, Aparna steadily held a torch in her hand despite the slight bumps on the road. Gatril’s keen sense of smell, sight and hearing would also alert them to anyone their lights couldn’t reveal. Despite a few critters and the croaks and chirps of the nocturnal residents, they found nothing out of the ordinary.
“We’re here,” said Kiran as they reached the cluster of trees. Darkness stared back at them, silent and waiting.
“We should stop here and set up bait,” said Aparna.
Kiran said, “Good idea,” and proceeded to park the vehicle in the grass along the path.
Kiran went to the back of the quacycle and took out the items needed to attract the popobawa. 
The popobawas were beings with an appetite for blood, so Kiran took out a jar of cow’s blood and poured it into a bucket, enhancing the fragrance with special chemicals. Gatril helped to place it on a large piece of wood similar to a rat trap, only instead of throwing over an iron bar to crush whatever would take the bait, it had a hollow holder container a powdered plant that would be launched at the unsuspecting victim. The powder of the plant would then paralyze the target when inhaled.
They carried the trap a few yards into the forest, knowing the popobawa wouldn’t want to venture out of its cover, and quickly sprinted out of the trees before their prey caught on to them. 
Kiran, Gatril and Aparna crouched in a nearby brush, silently waiting on the popobawa to take the bait.
“How long will we have to be here?” said Gatril.
“I don’t know,” said Kiran.
They heard and abrupt sound. A creaking one of sorts. It struck them silent, and they strained their ears.
Aparna said, “That…sounded like the trap, Kiran.”
“Already?” Kiran sounded incredulous. 
Gatril, unlike the humans, immediately realized what was going on. “It’s the trap alright, but way too soon. Something must’ve seen us coming—or has been waiting on us.”
“W-What?” Kiran sounded panicky. “B-But who?”
Something landed before them. They sprung up and scattered themselves to get room to commence battle. 
“What the hell was that?” Kiran said. He quickly switched on the lantern, revealing the bucket of blood. 
“It threw the bucket back!” Aparna said.
Gatril went to Kiran and took the lantern from him. “What are you doing?” he said.
Gatril ignored Kiran and tossed it in the grass near the trees. With the dry weather they were having, the ground quickly caught fire. Gatril retreated with the others, waiting impatiently as adrenaline surged through her veins.
