“Your milkshake would have been on the floor if I hadn't moved to grab it in time. I'm telling you now, everything in this room moved in slow motion like the time was slowing down for me to catch it before it leaked on the floor. And then hearing Bane whispering to Paul to stop staring or he'd tear him apart. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he's sitting right by the door and I'm all the way back here! Something's wrong with me!”
I turn around to face the coffee machine and pour myself a large cup of coffee.
Sam speaks to me in a quiet and comforting tone, she probably knows that I'm close to losing my mind.
“This all happened after it bit you?”
“Yeah, and it scares me to even think about what could happen to me. What if I actually turn into one?” I turn around with my mug of coffee and sit next to her.
Sam scoffs, “You're my best friend, and whatever happens just know that I'll be there for you. Even if you don't want my help, you shouldn't go through this alone. So, if you do turn into a big scary wolf, which is impossible by the way, I promise not to tell anyone. The last thing I want is you chasing me on a full moon.”
Sam stays with me till the end of the shift but leaves shortly when her mother comes to take her home. Sally offers to take me home, but I politely decline because I've got to lock up the diner.
I take out the trash, brush and mop the floor, then change out of my uniform. I lock up the back and exit through the front.
I double check that the door is locked when I hear rustling coming from behind me. I shrug it off blaming the wind, but when I hear it again I can't help but think it's the wolf from last night. I stay rooted to the ground in absolute fright when I hear laughter coming from behind me.
