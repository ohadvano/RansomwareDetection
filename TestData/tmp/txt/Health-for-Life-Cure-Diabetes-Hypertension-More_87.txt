
â€¢Processed foods are a major source of hidden refined sodium

â€¢Food Sources: virtually everything we eat. So stay with natural foods like fruits and vegetables.

Note: I did not supplement sodium as I was getting enough from my diet and was closely watching all sodium consumption. The information above will help you limit over-abundance of sodium in your system.

Magnesium

â€¢Recommended: 300 mg daily for women and 400 mg daily for men

â€¢Fourth most abundant mineral found in the body â€“ about 25 grams â€“ with more than Â½

stored in the bones.

â€¢Involved in over 300 metabolic actions, including inside cells where energy is produced.

â€¢Works to keep bone density by preventing loss of calcium

â€¢Helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels and promotes normal blood pressure

â€¢Having adequate reserves helps fight against cardiovascular disease and immune disease

15

â€¢Food Sources: green foods, such as spinach, nuts and seeds, beans and peas, unrefined grains, peanut butter and raw vegetables

Note: I did supplement magnesium with a 100 mg capsule daily, as the medications I was on lowered my magnesium levels. My doctor considered it necessary based on my blood test results. By the way, magnesium is not normally tested in a blood panel. You have to specifically request. Most Americans are deficient in magnesium levels. I now supplement my diet with 1 teaspoon of liquid angstrom magnesium daily.

Potassium

â€¢Recommended: 3500 mg daily

â€¢Critical for pH balance

â€¢Helps regulate heart rate, smooth muscle contractions and high-speed nerve function

â€¢Regulates cell permeability from inside the cells, working with sodium on the outside of the cell, allowing for free passage of nutrients and waste

â€¢Regulates sodium and water levels in the body.

â€¢Attracts oxygen to cells

â€¢Helps maintain good cardiovascular health

â€¢Low blood sugar depletes potassium. Potassium is used to treat diabetes

â€¢Tobacco and caffeine reduce the body's ability to absorb potassium

â€¢Food Sources: bananas, potatoes, yams, raisins, soybeans, apricots, figs, nuts and seeds

Note: I did supplement potassium as the medications I was on lowered my potassium levels. The dosage was two 99 mg tablets twice daily. My doctor considered it necessary based on my blood test results. I now use 1 teaspoon of liquid angstrom potassium daily.

Greens

Greens are grasses, grains and plant-based foods that are highly alkaline pH that have been put into a powder form that are easily absorbed by the body. Most are made to mix with water or juice. Each one has a varied mixture and claims their formula is the best blend. I used Kimâ€™s Greens at first and then switched to pH Balance Greens because I heard it tasted better. It is OK, but I feel I get a better boost from Kimâ€™s Greens. Kimâ€™s is organic and, no offense to the product, tastes like grass. It worked well for me, especially when I added it to my morning smoothie. I switch between various brands now trying to test their effectiveness. So far I have found the products containing more grasses work best for me. The greens are packed with highly absorbable nutrients as found in the original plants. They are a great help in alkalizing the body, which is an important part of this program. Some athletes use them in their shakes to add energy and increase performance. Greens are definitely a good, safe additive to your diet to increase your nutrient supply and give you a boost of energy.

Chromium

â€¢Recommended: 200 mcg daily

â€¢Controls insulin and blood sugar, acting as an agent to combine them together so that the blood sugar is absorbed by cells. Blood sugar that roams the blood stream unattached to insulin is what leads to blindness, poor circulation, poor healing abilities and amputations in diabetics.

â€¢Lowers bad cholesterol (LDL), raises good cholesterol (HDL)

â€¢Increases immune system functioning

â€¢Decreases hypertension (high blood pressure)

â€¢Increases DHEA production in the body

â€¢Essential trace mineral for carbohydrate and fat metabolism

â€¢Is depleted by intense activity such as weightlifting or intense exercise

â€¢Research shows that there is no side affect for taking larger quantities by dieters and athletes

â€¢Food Sources: Brewerâ€™s yeast, grains, nut (especially brazil nuts), leafy lettuce (romaine), onions, tomatoes and potatoes.

Note: I did supplement chromium picolinate at 200 mcg daily as chromium reduces bad cholesterol and works to increase good cholesterol. It has many great benefits for diabetes too. I continue to take the same dosage.

Niacin â€“ also known as vitamin B3

â€¢Recommended: 20 mg daily

â€¢Essential for the release of energy from food

â€¢Help in maintaining healthy skin, blood cells, normal growth and development, hormone production, a healthy brain and nervous system and the repair of genetic material

â€¢Stabilizes blood sugar

â€¢Helps the body process fats

â€¢Reduce harmful cholesterol and increases good cholesterol levels

â€¢Taking more than needed can lead to itching and red skin

â€¢Food Sources: Asparagus, mushrooms, sea vegetables, salmon, tuna, chicken, turkey and vegetables such as leaf lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, broccoli and spinach

Note: I did supplement niacin at 100 mg daily as niacin reduces bad cholesterol, and more importantly, in my case, works to increase good cholesterol. I still take the same dosage.

Cinnamon

â€¢Recommended: no RDA - One 500 mg capsule = Â¼ teaspoon - Take 2000 mg daily

â€¢Helps prevent unwanted clumping of blood platelets

â€¢Lessons inflammation

â€¢Helps stop the growth of bacteria and fungi

17

â€¢Slows the rate at which the stomach empties after meals & lowers foodâ€™s glycemic index

â€¢Improves the ability to respond to insulin and use glucose in the blood

â€¢1 gram per day (approx Â¼ to Â½ teaspoon) of cinnamon produced an average 20% drop in blood sugar, with additional drops in cholesterol and triglycerides in recent studies

â€¢A 40 day study showed results as follows: cinnamon reduced blood sugar levels by 18-29%, triglycerides 23-30%, LDL cholesterol 7-27%, and total cholesterol 12-26%.

â€¢Cinnamon scent boosts brain function â€“ smell it before a test - seriously

â€¢May provide relief from constipation and diarrhea

â€¢Excellent source of the trace mineral manganese and a very good source of dietary fiber, iron and calcium

â€¢1 teaspoon cinnamon (approx 2000 mg) provides 0.38 mg manganese, 1.24 g dietary fiber, 0.85 mg iron and 27.84 mg calcium

Note: I did supplement cinnamon at least 2000 mg daily; two 500 mg capsules in the morning and two 500 mg capsules in the evening â€“ and sometimes mid-day. Cinnamon just has too many benefits not to include it in your diet, especially if you are dealing with diabetes. I still take at least 2000 mg daily.

Turmeric

â€¢Recommended: No RDA - Take 400 mg up to 3 times daily

â€¢Reduces fat deposits near the liver

â€¢Reduces LDL (bad) cholesterol and promotes production of HDL (good) cholesterol

â€¢Thins the blood

â€¢Reduces inflammation

â€¢When applied topically (on the skin) helps heal psoriasis, fungal infections and athleteâ€™s foot

â€¢Acts as an antibiotic when applied to skin and exposed to sunlight

Note: I did supplement turmeric-curcumin 400 mg daily. It is good for cholesterol levels and fat deposits near the liver. I still take 400 mg daily of turmeric.

Omega 3-6-9 Oils â€“

â€¢Recommended: Not established

â€¢Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to help keep cholesterol levels low, stabilize irregular heart beat, and reduce blood pressure

â€¢Omega-3 fatty acids are also natural blood thinners, reducing the "stickiness" of blood cells

â€¢The brain is 60% fat and needs omega-3 fats to function properly

â€¢Omega-3 fatty acids may help maintain healthy breast tissue and prevent breast cancer

â€¢Without a sufficient supply of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, the body will use saturated fat to construct cell membranes, resulting in cell membranes that are less elastic, a situation that makes the heart muscle stiffer and less able to return to a resting state

18

â€¢Omega-3 is important in helping cells resist infection with influenza and the herpes family of viruses by supporting healthy cell wall development that act as anti-inflammatory agents

â€¢Omega-3 and -6 fatty acids cannot be produced by the body.

â€¢Omega 6 fatty acids are a chain of polyunsaturated fatty acids, also called linoleic acid, an essential fatty acid

â€¢Omega 9 fatty acids can be produced by the body and are therefore not considered essential oils as the body can produce them as needed.

â€¢Food Sources: cold water fish (omega-3), flaxseed oil (omega 3-6-9) and borage seed oil (omega 6-9)

Note: I did supplement one 1200 mg soft gel of Omega 3-6-9 three times daily at my doctorâ€™s recommendation because of its health benefits for the heart and cholesterol. I do not use any cooking oil other than virgin coconut oil for cooking (see below), so I do not get omega-6 fatty acids in my diet naturally. If you do use cooking oils, chances are you get more omega-6 than your body needs. If so, donâ€™t use the omega 3-6-9 supplement. Use an omega-3 supplement containing fish oil. Today I continue to take the omega 3-6-9 twice daily.

Virgin Coconut Oil

â€¢Is a medium chain saturated fat that is good for you and easily metabolized

â€¢It does not denature like other oils when heated and cannot turn into trans fats

â€¢Does not contribute to bad cholesterol and raises good cholesterol in some people

â€¢Contains lauric acid, which supports the immune system

â€¢Research has shown that the shorter medium chain fatty acids found in coconut oil boost the bodyâ€™s metabolism, balance blood sugar and control diabetes, dissolve kidney stones, protect against cancer, raise body temperatures, and help provide greater energy. Results are a healthier, leaner body, more energy and healthier skin.

â€¢A small amount is all that is needed for cooking and frying, unlike vegetable oils.

Multi Vitamins

There are so many multi vitamins available from so many companies, with so many different mixtures and dosages. I choose one from the same company I get most of my other supplements, taking one each day.

Alkaline Drops

The drops are used to alkalize water, which in turn alkalizes the blood and the fluids in and around your cells. It is important to this program. I stopped using drops after I no longer needed medicine.

19

OXYGEN

Oxygen is the most important thing we need to support life. We can live for weeks without food, days without water, but only minutes without oxygen. It is necessary for all functions in our body. To convert nutrients to energy we need oxygen. There is no other element that is more important to life than oxygen.

A stroke happens when something interrupts the oxygen flow to the body. This usually happens in the brain when a ruptured blood vessel or a clot stops oxygen-rich blood from flowing. The result is lack of proper use of whatever that area of the body controls. I had a stroke in my brain March 6, 2007 while I was sleeping. The result was slurred speech, loss of movement on my entire right side (not just muscular movement of my arms and legs, but everything, including chewing, bowel control and all the little functions we take for granted) and an incredible sleepiness.

I discovered that hyperbaric oxygen treatment (A one hour treatment that involves increasing the atmospheric pressure while breathing oxygen rich air. The treatment allows your body to absorb up to 7 times the oxygen it can normally absorb.) has a phenomenal success rate in treating stroke suffers, diabetics, cancer patients, surgery patients, amputees and a myriad of other conditions and diseases. The treatment is $150 to $250 an hour and can get expensive since it isnâ€™t covered by most insurance for most conditions. As a stroke patient the doctors estimated 60 to 90 treatments to restore me close to normal. One treatment was very restorative and one day I hope to be able to have more treatments performed so that I might reverse my disabilities resulting from the stroke. It would be great to have the treatment at least once a month just for a terrific energy boost.

In the meantime I have discovered liquid oxygen. (It is a means to super oxygenate water. Some doctors say it wonâ€™t work because we get all the oxygen we need by breathing. But think of it logically. Water is hydrogen and oxygen. The digestive track absorbs water and the oxygen can also be used to fuel our cells. Maybe it is a placebo. But Iâ€™ve learned that if the medical system decries something, at least take a second look. It sure appears to work and gives more energy.)

The point is that oxygen is necessary for body functioning. Large doses of oxygen allow the body to heal itself faster. The lack of oxygen leads to a build-up of toxins, which leads to disease. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced during cellular energy production and released by the respiratory system. A build-up is extremely harmful. Notice it takes oxygen to produce CO2 and it takes oxygen for the CO2 to be released in the air we breathe. The more oxygen we have in our system, the more potential energy we have.

Around the world most people breathe shallowly. We only breathe about 25% of our lung capacity, robbing our bodies of rich oxygen that could be energizing us throughout the day.

Deep breathing creates a suction which literally pulls lymph from the bloodstream and increases the rate at which toxins are removed from the body.

"Deep diaphragmic breathing is the equivalent of having a vacuum cleaner in your immune system pulling the poisons out at a rapid pace."

â€” Dr. Jack Shields

Our lymph system carries away and excretes toxins in the body. This results in a clean, healthy environment for your cells to function at maximum. We have a pump, the heart, for blood flow. No such pump exists for lymph circulation. Lymph relies on movement and breathing for its circulation. By practicing deep breathing we create a suction pump to move lymph at 15 times the normal rate.

In addition, the lowest portion of the lungs has the richest blood flow and can provide the greatest exchange of oxygen into our bodies. Deep breathing draws more air into our lungs, causing them to fill, allowing for greater oxygen absorption.

One deep breathing exercise is to Inhale for 6 seconds, Hold that breath for 24 seconds, Exhale for 12 seconds. Kind of like when you were a kid and had a contest to see how long you could hold your breath under water. Perform something like this 3 times a day for a week or so and watch your energy levels increase. It takes practice, but the benefits are awesome.

Aerobic Exercise means to exercise with oxygen. Regular exercise provides so many benefits to the body. Besides developing a strong cardiovascular/circulatory system, aerobic exercise moves the lymph through the body, cleansing your system. It is also a fantastic way to get large concentrations of oxygen into your body, where the oxygen can work its wonders.

Aerobic exercise does not need to be hard. It should be at a comfortable pace, but it should get your heart beating and increase your breathing rate. The key to consider is that the longer the exercise, the better for you. Studies show that the benefits are additive, meaning you can break 20 minutes of exercise into four 5-minute sessions and get the same benefits of one 20 minute session. I personally feel more satisfied with one session. However, splitting exercise times can be a great way to get your exercise benefits with a busy schedule â€“

especially at work.

Training aerobically will increase your blood supply, boost your immune system, increase the oxygenation of your cells and promote the elimination of cellular wastes. Aerobic

21

exercise also produces endorphins, which drive away stress and depression and stimulate the immune system. Exercise also increases your levels of growth hormones; another reason to get our kids to exercise.

Examples of aerobic exercise: brisk walking, swimming, dancing, running, bicycling, rowing, stair climbing, jump roping, hiking, rowing, etc. Exercise can be fun. Choose an activity you enjoy and mix it up. Have fun! Remember when we were kids and playing was all the aerobic activity we needed?

22

WATER

Water is the second most important thing your body needs to live, right behind oxygen. You can live without food for weeks, but you can only survive for a few days without water. Everything in your body takes place in water. You need fluids for cellular function, to transport fuel and oxygen to the cells, to remove body waste, and to regulate your body temperature.

Our bodies are about 70% water. The bloodstream that carries nutrients, oxygen and hormones throughout is about 85% water. It also carries waste to the kidneys for removal. You need water for the kidneys to function properly to remove the waste. We need to keep our bodies hydrated to keep waste from accumulating. The brain is about 80% water and uses about 20% of blood flow even though it accounts for only 2% of our body weight. Dehydration leaves the brain with less energy and can even lead to depression.

Besides all of the other functions of water in our bodies, water helps maintain blood pressure and is important to keep our pH levels at optimum levels. Water itself is close to neutral on the pH scale, helping us maintain a slightly alkaline pH.

If you want beautiful, smooth skin you must keep hydrated. Water will keep your cells functioning, helps conduct the electrical charge of energy at the cellular level and is important in cooling us on a hot day and preventing sunburns. There are so many reasons to drink plenty of water.

Coffee, tea, sodas, juice from concentrate and beer are not water. Though water may be a component to the production of these drinks, they have a diuretic effect, causing the body to lose water. We already lose water through sweat, breathing, urine and waste removal. We donâ€™t need to cause additional fluid loss.

Drugs can have a negative affect on water concentrations. When I took high blood pressure medicine it caused my body to deplete potassium and thus retain water, increasing my blood pressure. The doctor then prescribed a water pill and potassium pill to remove the water to lower my blood pressure and restore potassium. If I didnâ€™t take medicine in the first place, but supplemented my potassium intake it seems it would have kept my blood pressure regular naturally. I could avoid three pills daily. No wonder the drug companies make a fortune. If you take one you may have to take more to counter the side effects.

How much water should you drink daily? Half of your body weight in ounces is a good start. That means if you weigh 150 pounds you should drink 75 ounces of water throughout the day. That amounts to drinking 5 of the 16-oz packaged plastic water bottles daily. I reuse my plastic bottles daily, filling them up each night to get them nice and cold and ready for the

23

next day. (I use the bottles for at least 2 weeks before recycling them. This saves a lot of money. By the way, many people say you should drink the water at room temperature. There is no statistical data to support this unless you eat a high fat meal followed by cold water. The cold water causes the fat to solidify, disrupting digestion.)

When using this program it is very important to drink plenty of water. The more water you can drink daily, the easier it is for your body to re-create an alkaline balance to your body fluids. The first few days will require more restroom visits and maybe some loose stools, but it passes after a few days as your system adjusts. The first few days I went all out and drank about 192 ounces daily. I found 150 ounces to be a much better fit after a few days. That is one more bottle per day than the formula above suggests. If you sweat more from summer heat or exercise, you may want to replenish the fluids lost with more water.

FOODS TO AVOID

PROCESSED OILS

By now everyone knows that hydrogenated fats and partially hydrogenated fats are very bad. We call them trans fats. Our bodies have the worst time processing them. They are like poison to body functions. The food industry has listened and you find less use of these oils, but they are still being used. Always check the label of processed foods to make sure they donâ€™t contain these oils. Even better, avoid processed foods.

These fats are from vegetable oils that denature while heating. Food manufacturers use them because they prolong the shelf life of foods. Not only do these fatty oils cause an accumulation of bad cholesterol (LDL), but they wipe out good cholesterol (HDL). They also wreak havoc on insulin, preventing it from bonding to glucose (sugar) molecules so it can be utilized by the cells, leading to obesity and diabetes. To maintain proper pH, the body canâ€™t let these molecules just keep floating around; fat is created to store these unutilized molecules.

Donâ€™t confuse these fats with all fats. There are fats our bodies do need. We call these essential fatty acids â€“ Omega 3-6-9 (see Nutrients section). Our body needs them to function at optimal efficiency.

General Rule of Thumb â€“ Do not cook with oil! Do not fry! Do not deep fry! Do not sautee! When you heat oil it denatures the oil, changing its chemical makeup. Plus Americans intake an estimated 26 times the fat we need by using even healthy cooking oils. I use water and add herbs and seasonings to season my foods. On the occasions I use salt for flavoring I use natural rock salt containing a lot of nutrients. After a short time you will notice how much the flavors of the foods pop out. Cooking with oils hides the true flavor of Godâ€™s bounty. Better yet, if you can eat it raw, the better the benefits to you. I personally save the water from stew and soup so I can drink all of the nutrients that wash out during cooking. Interesting note: foods like carrots, potatoes and cabbage that are more fibrous will actually produce more beneficial body-healthy fiber as you cook them and break down the cellulose fibers.

Use olive oil and other healthy oils in place of butter and margarine and in salad dressings. But limit how much you use.

Note: Virgin coconut oil is the only oil that does not denature no matter the heating temperature. If I want to fry something, or to cook with oil, virgin coconut oil is the only oil I will use. It is 100% natural. It has so many healthy benefits and is good for you. (See

25

Nutrients section for more info on health benefits.) I use it instead of butter and margarine for buttering a potato or toast, for baking healthy cookies and for salad dressing. Interestingly it is solid until about 80 degrees, so you have to heat it slightly to use it as salad dressing. Do not use internally if it doesnâ€™t say â€˜virginâ€™ coconut oil. Plain coconut oil is bleached and processed.
