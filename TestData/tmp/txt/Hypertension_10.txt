recommended a 25 percent reduction in the consumption of fat, and a 25 percent increase

in carbohydrates (particularly in the form of whole grains, fruits and vegetables). the



104

committee cited the relationship between the current fat rich, fiber deficient American diet,

and the high risk of cancer as wel as heart ailments and other diseases.



Water - One should drink a minimum of two quarts of distil ed water daily. If you are

overweight or doing hard physical work then you need more than 2 quarts. When we do

not drink enough water our body wil absorb water from the fecal matter that is in our

colon. This in turn makes the fecal matter hard, which causes constipation. Our bodies

use much more water than we realize. Each day we lose one and one half glasses of

water, through breathing alone. Over a quart a day is lost in urine; and every time we blink

our eyes, our body loses some water. Of course, our body loses large amounts of water

through perspiration.

Exercise - Exercise wil help one to have regular eliminations. You have six

hundred thirty three muscles, every one of which needs to be used. If we do not use our

muscles, they lose their tone, strength and flexibility. Exercise doesn't have to be painful.

There are hundreds of ways to exercise the human body. The exercise having the most

benefit is walking and no special equipment is required, except a good pair of shoes.

Stress - Do you remember a time when you were enjoying a good meal with

friends and you received a phone cal giving you terrible news? You suddenly lost your

appetite and you even felt light headed and sick. The relation that exists between the

mind, and the body is very intimate. When one is affected the other sympathizes. Stress

today is one of the causes of poor digestion, ulcers and constipation. Grief, anxiety,

discontent, remorse, guilt, distrust, or other emotions, al tend to break down the life

forces. Isaiah 26:3 gives us the answer to this problem.

Medications - Medications can cause many problems with the bowel. The side

effects of many medications cause constipation for many physiological reasons.

Antibiotics, such as penicil in and sulfa can completely eliminate the favorable intestinal

flora, leaving the opportunity for reinfestation by harmful bacteria and viruses.

Laxatives - Laxatives are irritating to the bowel and are dangerous. Today there

are more than 45,000 laxative and cathartic medications being manufactured and used in

America. These substances, in order to evacuate the colon, are essential y poisons and

irritants. The poisoned intestinal tract tries to evacuate the offending substance as quickly

as possible and pushes everything out. Often times, these harsh poisonous substances

are absorbed through the lymph and blood vessels and find their way to al parts of the

body affecting the liver, kidneys, and other vital areas. Many of these medications can

become addicting, and can destroy the ability of the bowel to eliminate natural y.



HERBS

Herbs can be used successful y and safely for constipation. One of the best herbs

for constipation is Cascara Sagrada. Mix four teaspoonfuls in a quart of distil ed water

(that was boiling and just taken off the stove). Let it steep for one hour, then drink one or

two cupfuls one hour before meals or on an empty stomach.

To get wel and stay wel , our bodies have to be clean on the inside as wel as the

outside. If you wil eat natural unrefined foods, drink plenty of pure water, gets proper

exercise, stay away from medications, and al ow God to handle the stress in your life, you

should not have any problems with proper elimination.

FASTING



Fasting is the oldest therapeutic method known to man. Even before the advent of

the healing arts, man instinctively stopped eating when feeling il and abstained from food

until his health was restored. Perhaps he learned this from animals, which always fast

when not feeling wel

There is much said throughout the entire Bible about fasting. God instituted fasting

for both spiritual and physical blessings. Fasting has two purposes - the up building of the

body and the spiritual up building of the soul. As fasting improves physical health, it also

improves mental health causing the mind to be open to a greater extent to the leading and

impressions of the Holy Spirit.

I am thoroughly convinced that a great many people eat too much (over 60% of al

Americans are overweight). Many eat food that does not give them proper nourishment;

they eat food that is highly refined and unwholesome. This food wil gradual y, over a

period of time, bring upon them sickness and death.

Many scientific studies are now being made around the world, particularly in Europe, to

determine the therapeutic effects of fasting. The Karalinska Institute in Stockholm, a world

famous medical research institution, has made clinical studies of fasting under Drs. P.

Reizenstein and J. Kel berg. These studies demonstrated that fasting has a definite

beneficial healing effect.



WATER FAST VS. JUICE FAST VS. FRUIT & VEGETABLE FAST

There are persons who advocate long fasts for health, but I discourage long water

fasts as they can be quite harmful to the body. However, a prolonged fresh fruit and

vegetable fast I highly recommend. Proper fasting can do a lot in helping with one's health;

but improper fasting can be harmful to one's health. A normal person can fast one to three

days on only distil ed water without any injury and it wil be quite beneficial both spiritual y

and physical y to one's health. If you fast on water only for more than three days, then you

are living on the broken down tissues in your body which produces an acid reaction. This

thickens the blood; and with a high concentration of poisons in the bloodstream, puts a

burden on the heart, arteries, kidneys, liver, lungs, etc.

We can help this cleansing process by eating lots of fresh raw vegetables and fruits

as most are alkaline forming and wil increase the healing effect of fasting as elimination of

uric acid and other inorganic acids wil be accelerated. The vitamins, minerals, enzymes

and trace elements of raw vegetables and fruits are important in supplying needed

elements for the body's own healing.

Fasting in Europe is practiced on a grand scale. There are hundreds of clinics in

Germany alone where fasting is a number one method of healing. Al of them use juice

fasting exclusively. I believe that juice fasting is preferable to water fasting, but that the

whole fruit or vegetable fast is preferable to a juice fast. Which is more natural, the orange

or orange juice? He would have put a lid on top of the orange. When you use juice

instead of the whole food, while you are fasting, you wil have problems with elimination as

there is no fiber or bulk in juice.





106

FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLESS: FAST CLEANSES THE BODY

It is wel to know the process your body goes through in the course of a fast. The

first three days are usual y the most difficult in terms of hunger pains. By the fourth day the

hunger pains are beginning to subside, though you wil have feelings of weakness and

occasional dizziness. During a prolonged fast (after the first three days) your body wil live

on its own substance. When it is deprived of needed nutrition such as proteins and fats, it

wil burn and digest its own tissues. But your body wil not do it indiscriminately -and here

lies the secret of the effectiveness of fasting -your body wil first decompose and burn

those cel s and tissues which are diseased, damaged, aged, or dead.



In fasting, your body feeds itself on the most impure and inferior materials such as

tumors, abscesses, fat deposits, etc. Dr. Otto Buchanan, M.D. (one of the greatest fasting

authorities in the world) cal s fasting -very pertinently - a "refuse disposal", a "burning of

rubbish". During fasting, while the old cel s and diseased tissues are decomposed and

burned, the building of new healthy cel s is speeded up. This eliminative process is

evidenced by some of the fol owing typical symptoms: offensive breath, dark urine, skin

eruptions, excessive perspiration, catarrhal eliminations of mucus, and headaches. Do not

be disturbed by those symptoms; rather, be grateful for the increased health and wel -

being that wil result.

By the ninth or tenth day of a longer fast, the body wil normal y have eliminated the

bulk of toxic poisons and you wil start feeling great. Your sense of concentration wil be

greater, and you wil feel as if you could continue fasting indefinitely as you are not

hungry. Your fast can last as long as you like (it could go on for weeks as it depends upon

how much fresh fruit and vegetables you are eating), but it must end when your hunger

pains return. This is the signal that the body has used up al its excess reserves. The fast

should be broken at this time.





ADDITIONAL TIPS ON FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLE FAST

Do not drink with meals, and do not mix fruits and vegetables at the same meal. Eat

only fresh fruits and vegetables, nothing cooked or dried. Eat no more than twice a day at

a regular time each day, and nothing between meals, except water or herb tea. One must

drink a minimum of two quarts of distil ed water daily; more is better. Bathing once or twice

daily is also beneficial, as one third of al body impurities and wastes are eliminated

through the skin. Do lots of deep breathing of outside air. Red clover tea is a very good

herb to take while one is on a fast. It is an excel ent blood purifier and wil help your body

detoxify. Drink it as often as you like.

FEVERS





The normal temperature taken oral y is 98.6Â° F.

However, it may be within the range of normal if it is one

degree above or two degrees below this value. When an

individual comes down with a fever, their body is trying to tel

them something is wrong.



Fever happens to be a defense strategy employed by

the body that helps to destroy bacteria and viruses that have

gotten out of hand. Bacteria and viral microbes live normal y

and natural y inside of human beings. They co-exist with us,

around us and inside us, and when our body's immune

system is working properly, these microbes cause us little

concern. In fact, many scientists have demonstrated that

these microbes are often important to our inner functioning

and biochemical existence. Our body's own innate ability to

keep bacteria and viruses in check inside of us via our immune system is the best way to

stay wel . Our bodies contain over seventy thousand tril ion cel s that al make their own

chemicals. They make them in the right quantities and there are no il side effects. When a

person does get a fever it is the body's natural way of destroying bacteria and viruses.

These bacteria and viruses find it extremely difficult to sustain their existence in higher

temperature ranges, and so the body's immune system causes the fever to kil off the

microbes.



Thus, when our body has a fever, it is not good to lower the fever as this wil hinder

the body from doing its job of getting rid of the problems causing the fever.

What we need to do is help our body by raising our temperature. Many years ago

when someone had a fever, they would put them to bee cover them up with lots of

blankets, and eve put hot water bottles on their feet. They would also give the individual

large amounts of put soft water to drink. After a time the fever would break and the person

was on their way to recovery.



ISN'T TOO HIGH A FEVER DANGEROUS?



Conventional medicine spends most of its time treating symptoms or signs of

disease instead of treating the disease. For example, when one has a fever and goes to

the doctor h is given medication, such as aspirin, to lower the fever. By lowering the fever

by chemical y introducing a drug, the medical profession is not treating the disease but

instead only addressing the symptom. Medicine as a profession ha taught us that it is

beneficial to lower the fever whereas, in reality, this wil cause harm to the body. By

lowering the fever artificial y this prevents the immune system from doing the job is

supposed to do, thus the person gets sicker 2 the microbes increase.



As long as the temperature is below 105Â° F, it wil not cause harm or brain damage

to normal person. When I worked at a hospital in Central America we had patients come in

with malaria who had high temperatures and it didnâ€™t cause brain damage.



108





IS THERE A NATURAL WAY TO LOWER A FEVER?

If a person's temperature goes over 105Â° make sure they are drinking plenty of

water. If they are drinking the water and their temperature is stil over 105Â° F. then the best

way to lower the fever is by putting them into a ful bath tub of water that is around 98Â° -

100Â° F. Never put them into ice water or cold water. This wil cause most of the blood from

the legs and arms to go to the trunk of the body and wil hinder circulation and be

detrimental.



WHAT ELSE SHOULD BE DONE FOR A HIGH FEVER?

As long as the fever is below 105Â° F. let it take its course. Give plenty of water as

mentioned earlier. If they want to eat give them only fresh fruit. Make sure they are

comfortable and in quiet surroundings. Be sure they have plenty of fresh air and sunshine,

and that they bathe everyday. Most fevers are of a rather short duration, but occasional y

they can last for a longer period of time. The human body is the greatest doctor alive.

When one has a fever, help the fever to do its job natural y.

FOODS - ACID AND ALKALINE





Al food, as they are digested or burned, leave an ash in the body. This ash can be

neutral, acid or alkaline, depending on the mineral composition of the food. The acid ash

(acidosis) results when there is a depletion of the alkaline ash. In the healing of sickness,

the higher the ratio of alkaline forming foods in the diet, the faster wil be the recovery.

Alkalis neutralize the acids. Al the minerals that make up the red blood cel s and the blood

plasma are alkaline, except for chlorine which is acid. There are other important fluids in

the body which are alkaline. Some of these are saliva, bile, tears, lymph, joint lubricant,

muscle lubricant, colon secretion and pancreatic juice. None of the alkaline juices are

body wastes, though the bile contains waste. Some body fluids that are acidic are urine,

perspiration, fluid emitted during expiration, fatigue wastes and gastric juice. Al of these

fluids are body wastes except for the gastric juice, which is used for digestion. It is

important to realize that the body fluids which contribute to the life processes are al

alkaline except the gastric juice and that the waste fluids are al acid. The acid products

must be eliminated because the healthy state of the body is one of alkalinity. If the tissues

of the body become acid to the slightest degree, serious il ness occurs and death can

result.

The degree of acidity or alkalinity of a substance is expressed in pH values, the "p"

indicates the potency, while the "H" is for hydrogen ions which is the name the chemist

gives to the particular element constituting the acid. The scale ranges from 0 (acid) to 14

(alkaline), with 7 being neutral, neither acid nor alkaline.

Normal blood is slightly alkaline, just above neutral, having a pH of 7.35. If the pH

of a person's blood reaches higher than 7.8 or fal s below 7.22, immediate death occurs. A

condition known as acidosis occurs when the pH of the blood drops below 7.35. If the

blood rises above the normal 7.35, alkalosis exists and grows more severe, until death

occurs when the pH reaches 7.8. This provides a variable range of only about .6 of a

degree. Disease occurs any time the blood does not have a normal pH of 7.35.

The more acid the fluids and tissues of the body become the more subject they are

to the growth of bacteria and germs, and the less able they are to combat them. It is now

known that acid-forming foods increase the excretion of calcium and phosphorus from the

body (causing osteoporosis) and that alkaline-forming foods tend toward a greater

retention of these mineral salts in the body. Kidney stones are sometimes concentrations

of uric acid crystals which are more apt to form when the urine is too acidic. A more

alkaline urine tends to dissolve them. A burning sensation can develop when the urine

becomes very acidic. By drinking large amounts of distil ed water one can speed the

process of acid elimination through the pores and kidneys. The pH of urine can be

changed in just a few hours.



110



The skin is provided with approximately 1,500,000 sweat glands, excreting

perspiration, which is acidic. The lungs give off carbonic acid gas which is released as

carbon dioxide and water. The burning of food and oxygen in the body cel s produces this

gas which is taken by lymph and blood to the lungs to be exhaled.

More processes of life are aided by alkaline fluids than acid. Both are necessary.

Alkalis are continual y being consumed and the supply depleted. Since they are

continual y being consumed, there is the danger that the supply wil be exhausted. It is

very plain then, that if foods wil influence the alkalinity and acidity of the body we need to

eat abundantly of that which wil keep the alkalinity of the body high, and eat sparingly of

foods which wil increase its acidity. The ideal ratio according to Dr. Roger Berg, the

world's foremost authority on the relationship between the acid-alkaline ratio in the diet, is

about 80% alkaline producing foods and 20% acid producing foods. The correct pH

balance of our blood can be maintained by choosing careful y the foods one eats. Another

factor, which influences the correct balance, is the ability of the kidneys, skin pores and

lungs to eliminate acids. It is important that these organs function properly.

Harmful acids that we should avoid are: acetic acid found in vinegar; tannic acid

found in coffee, tea and cocoa; and benzoic acid found in food preservatives. Foods that

are acid in themselves such as citrus, when digested and assimilated by the body leave

an alkaline residue, while alkaline foods leave an acid residue. Therefore, we refer to the

foods as either acid forming, or alkaline forming.

Studies have also confirmed that rest, exercise, fresh air, laughter and love are

alkalizers of the body; selfishness, anger, worry and hatred are acidifiers of the body.

FRESH FOOD IS BEST



In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve ate only fresh

fruits, nuts and grains. Eve didn't use a stove or microwave to

prepare Adam's meals. For one to have good health, a

minimum of 50% of our daily food intake should be raw foods.

Raw food is live food; cooked food is dead food. Have you

noticed how few fresh raw fruits and vegetables the average

person consumes?



Food processing, refining, cooking, and more recently,

the advent of microwaving, destroys the enzymes in the live

food we eat. These enzyme deficient foods cause imbalances

in our bodies, which in turn cause disease.



The biggest difference between live (raw) food and dead

(cooked) food is enzymatic activity and something I cal the life force. If you were to take

two seeds, boil one of them, and then put them both in the ground, which one do you think

would grow? The unboiled one would grow because the enzymes and the life force are

stil alive. Cooking stops enzymatic action and destroys the life force.



Enzymes are said to be protein molecules, and each enzyme acts in certain ways

in the body, doing specific jobs. Enzymes digest al our food. There are over 100,000

enzyme particles in a single drop of blood. They take digested food and build it into blood,

nerves, muscles, and glands. Enzymes assist in storing sugar in the liver and muscles.

There is an enzyme that builds phosphorus into bone and nerve tissue. Once we cook

food above 118 degrees, al the enzymes present in the food are completely destroyed,

and are no longer able to perform their designated function. Although the physical protein

molecule is stil present, it has lost its life force. Like a flashlight battery that has lost its

power, the physical structure remains, but the electrical energy is no longer present.



A protein molecule is actual y only the carrier of enzyme activity. In experiments

described in "Chemical Review", the activity of our protein molecule was transferred over

to another protein substance, leaving the original molecule devoid of its original activity(1).

This only proves further that an enzyme is the invisible activity or energy factor, and not

just the protein molecule itself.



Enzymes are needed for every chemical action and reaction in the body. Our

organs, tissues, and cel s are al run by metabolic enzymes. Minerals, vitamins, and

hormones need enzymes to be present in order to do their work properly. Enzymes are

the labor force of the body. Enzymes are involved in every metabolic process our immune

system, blood stream, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, etc.. Enzymes break down toxic

substances so that the body can eliminate them without damaging the eliminative

organs(2). Since 1968, thirteen hundred enzymes have been identified.

A diet high in cooked food lacks the enzymes that are in fresh food, and causes the

endocrine glands to become overworked, thus encouraging the development of diseases

such as hypoglycemia and obesity.

Enzymes may be divided into two groups, those found in raw food, and those

produced within our bodies. The more enzymes one gets from the raw food, the less that

wil have to be borrowed from other metabolic processes and supplied by the pancreas. It



112

is important to realize that the enzymes in raw food actual y digest 50% to 75% of the food

itself without the help of the enzymes secreted by the body. Nature has placed enzymes in

food to aid in the digestive process instead of forcing the body's enzymes to do al the

work. It is to be remembered that we inherited an enzyme reserve at birth, and this

quantity can be decreased as we age by eating an enzyme deficient diet. By eating most

of our food cooked, our digestive system has to produce al of the enzymes, thus causing

an enlargement of the digestive organs, especial y the pancreas. It also places a drain on

the body's immune system.

An experiment was performed at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago in relation to

saliva and its enzyme content. The younger group (aged 21 to 31) was found to have 30

times more amylase (an enzyme) in their saliva than those in the older group (aged over

69).(3)

In conclusion, this information is tel ing us that we need to eat more fresh fruits and

vegetables. Our diet should consist of at least 50% fresh food. We should eat our fresh

salads, etc., at the beginning of our meal. They are bulky and wil give us a more ful

feeling, helping us not to overeat cooked food. As one gets older, the intake of fresh food

should be increased to even more than 50%, since our bodies are more deficient of

enzymes. Investigations show that in warm temperatures, enzymes are used up more

rapidly than in cool temperatures. Additional fresh foods are therefore needed during the

summer months, and for those who live in the southern United States.

HEADACHES





There are many different types of headaches: tension headaches, migraine headaches,

al ergic headaches, etc. One may have a mild or severe headache, or the pain may be

frontal or toward the back of the head. It may be a dul aching pain, or an almost

unbearable pain. It may be an intermittent intense pain, a throbbing pain, a pressure pain,

or a penetrating pain.

A headache is not a disease, but a symptom, showing that something else is

wrong in the body and needs to be taken care of. A headache is like the red engine

warning light on the dashboard of your car. If you ignore the warning light when it comes

on, you won't get very far down the road before your car engine wil stop running. If you

ignore a headache,(which is a built-in warning device), your body wil also stop functioning

properly.



When a person has a headache his body is trying to tel him that something is

wrong. He may be constipated, or not getting enough sleep, or eating the wrong kind of

foods, or under too much stress, or not drinking enough water, or breathing poisonous air,

or taking the wrong medications, etc. It is sometimes hard to find the cause of headaches,

so one needs to look

very careful y at his lifestyle and be wil ing to make any necessary changes.



Monosodium glutamate (MSG) may also cause headaches in sensitive individuals.

Many who read food labels are unaware that MSG may be listed as "flavoring," "natural

flavoring," or hydrolized vegetable protein." Hydrolyzed vegetable protein may be 10-30%

MSG. (Headache 31:107-110, 1991)

Three of the major causes of headaches are constipation, dehydration, and stress.

When one is constipated, the waste material in the colon spoils and becomes putrefied

from being in the body too long. The blood capil aries to the colon begin to pick up the

toxins and poisons that are in the colon. These enter the blood stream (causing many



114

problems), and are carried to al parts of the body, including the brain where one develops

a headache. Two factors that wil improve constipation are drinking plenty of water, and

eating natural foods. Leave refined concentrated foods alone (there is no food more

constipating than cheese).

Not drinking enough water is another major cause of headaches. The human brain

is composed of over 80% water, and when a person doesn't drink enough water, they wil

have headaches. Everyone should drink at least two quarts of water daily. Stress is

another major cause of tension headaches. Two physical things we can do for tension

headaches are soaking in a bathtub of lukewarm water for a half hour, and drinking red

sage tea, which is excel ent for tension headaches.



Some other simple ways to relieve headaches are to take a hot foot bath with plain

water or with a tablespoon of mustard seed in it, and place a cold compress to the head

for 20 minutes. Two other herb teas that are good for headaches are peppermint and

black cohosh. Black cohosh is especial y good for severe headaches and congestion in

the head

In conclusion, remember that headaches are merely the body's warning signal that

something is wrong. Living natural y and healthful y, and learning to take handle our

burdens wil eliminate many of the stressful situations in our lives, and help us to deal with

those that do come in a calm way that wil minimize headaches.

HEART DISEASE





There are over 4,000 heart attacks every day in America. 50% of al deaths in the

U.S. are from cardiovascular disease. That is a ratio of 1 out of every 2 Americans.



No machine made by man is as durable or efficient as the

human heart. Although it is about the size of your two fists and

weighs only half a pound, every day it pumps several tons of

blood through over 60,000 miles of blood vessels. It is almost

beyond belief, the amount of work this smal but powerful organ

wil do in one day. At its normal rate of speed, the human heart

beats about seventy times a minute. This amounts to more than

100,000 contractions in one day, or thirty seven mil ion in one

year. Truly, our bodies are fearful y and wonderful y made.



What is the major cause of heart disease? DIET! Heart

disease is largely self-induced by the way we live. Smoking,

drinking alcohol, coffee, and tea, eating too much salt, and eating

refined foods are al harmful to your heart. Only industrialized

societies like ours can afford diets that are rich in meat, dairy products, eggs, fat, and

processed food products such as oils (corn oil, margarine, etc.) which are high in fat. In

America, 40% to 45% of the calories we eat come from fats. Ideal y, fat should make up

only 10% of our diet.

The ideal diet for someone with heart disease would be a low fat diet high in fresh

fruits and vegetables. A pure vegetarian diet, using no meat, dairy products, or eggs is

optimum. Meat and dairy products average 50% to 85% of their calories as fat. Some

dairy products are as high as 90% fat. See accompanying chart.

The regulars are kind and generous with their tips, and even my boss Robbie isn't so bad. He's a little on the lazy side and stares a little too long at my backside, but he always pays on time and lets me take any leftover food home with me.
I look up at the old round clock hung up on the wall and sigh in contempt.
Only half an hour to go.
I stare at the last customer of the night and pray silently that he's close to finishing. I grab the coffee pot, walk with a forced smile and approach the customer.
â€œMore coffee, sir?â€ I plead with my eyes in the hope that he would say no.
â€œNo, thank you, my dear.â€ He says as he stands from the table.
I help him put on his coat and grab his umbrella. He hands me a ten-pound note and walks out the door without a word. I put the money in the till and turn off the lights in the diner.
Afterwards, I head towards the back of the diner where the kitchen is, and realize it's only me and Terry left. He's looking at the schedule hanging up on the office wall with a look of dread on his face. Terry sighs loudly when he looks at the dates he's working. Terry's worked at the diner for over thirty years and not once has he had a day off. His hair is starting to gray, but he can cook the most delicious food I've ever had the pleasure of tasting.
â€œHey Terry, the last customer just left. Do you want me to lock up the diner for you?â€
Terry waves at me but doesn't look away from the schedule, â€œI'll lock up the front but could you do me a favor before you leave, dear?â€
Before I could respond to say anything, Terry gathers six plastic bags full of trash, and drops them at my feet.
â€œYou want me to take these out to the dumpster?â€ I ask as I gather all six bags, three in each hand, and look up at Terry.
â€œPlease, I would really appreciate it.â€ He grabs his jacket, waves, and leaves.
I stare at the swinging door dumbfounded and shake my head.
With the bags still in my hands, I leave through the back and walk towards the dumpster. I scoff when I see that it's pouring down with rain.
Great. Thanks, Terry. Thanks a bunch.
I push open the top of the dumpster, and grab the first two bags to throw in when from the darkness behind me, I hear the faint unmistakable sound of growling. I freeze, wondering if that was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Terrified, I clutch the bags close and turn around, holding the bags as one would a sword, ready to strike out. I turn, and as I open my eyes, I see the source of the growling, as standing not two meters away is the largest wolf I've ever seen.
I whimper in fright, and slowly start to retreat backwards, dropping my makeshift weapon as I go. I feel my back touch the dumpster, and realize there's nowhere for me to go. Shaking in fear, I close my eyes, praying the wolf doesn't see me as a threat or worse, a meal.
â€œPlease don't hurt me.â€ I whisper repeatedly to myself. I open my eyes and wish that I hadn't.
Its eyes will haunt me for as long as I live. The eyes were blood-red, filled with pure hatred towards me. A dull shade of gray covers its whole body with big chunks of its fur missing, like it had been ripped off. The wolf looked as though it had scars everywhere on its body. How had it managed to survive this long?
I do the only thing I can think of. I kneel down on the wet floor with my head bowed down in the hope it's a sign of submission. The wolf howls into the night and lunges for me. I scream as it tackles me but soon runs into the bushes and out of sight. I look in the direction the wolf ran and start laughing hysterically.
What the fuck	?
I shake my head and pick myself off the floor, my uniform completely ruined. I check myself over, and that's when I notice on my right shoulder that my clothing's been torn apart.
Why does my shoulder hurt so much?
It looked as though something had taken a chunk out of my shirt.
â€œOuch!â€ I wince, and as I touch my shoulder, I see red liquid coating the skin on my hand.
Blood! Did it bite me!?
I look around, trying to figure out whether that really happened.
Shaken, I chuck the last few bags in the dumpster, grab my bag, lock up and head home.
As I walk home in the dark, the rain no longer pouring, I look up into the night sky, and notice the full moon.
Chapter 2

When I arrive at school the next morning, all I can think about is last night. I woke up early to check if it actually happened, and knew that it did when I saw the bite marks. As a result, I couldn't sleep. At all. Sleeping on my right side hurt too much, and school was by far the last place I wanted to be.
I walk to my locker, grab my English book, and that's when I hear my best friend calling my name from the other end of the corridor.
â€œAlice! Did you watch Game of Thrones last night!?â€ One thing about Sam is that she doesn't give a damn about what anyone thinks of her. Me? I worry way too much about what people think.
When Sam reaches my locker, she places her hands on her hips and tilts her head for an answer I have yet to give. â€œSo, did you watch it?â€
I shake my head, â€œNo... I missed it.â€
â€œYou what!? How did you miss it!? You do realize it was the finale right!â€' She shrieks hysterically at me.
â€œSam.â€ I use my hand to signal her to lower her voice. â€œEveryone's staring.â€
â€œYou think I care about what people think?â€
She didn't give me a chance to answer. Instead, she turns around and faces all the onlookers. â€œDidn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to stare? My mum always tells me to never stare at anybody because if you do, some people might not be as nice as I'm going to be.â€
She turns around and shrugs at me when she sees the pure shock on my face. â€œI told you, I don't give a damn about what people think.â€
I look inside my bag to see if I have everything only to realize that I don't have my pencil case. I reopen my locker when I hear Sam sigh.
â€œPeople still staring?â€
â€œWhat? Oh, no just Ryder and his crew. They walk around here like they own the place, but seriously how does a guy even look that good?â€
After I grab my pencil case, I shut my locker and look at my best friend, whose mouth is wide open.
â€œSam! You're staring honey, and drooling.â€ I close her mouth, shove the pencil case in my bag and stare at them. Every single person moves to the side to make room for them to pass. You see, this gang does practically own the school, and if you hurt one of them, you hurt them all.
Everyone knows who they are and no one dares to try and talk to them or to even approach them. They walk side by side in a perfect line. Bane and Silver on the outside, with Kellan and Ryder in the middle.
Bane looks to be the most frightening one out of them all. He has an oval shaped face with small, blue piercing eyes. His mouth, full and firm with a constant sneer on his face. He has tanned skin with a warm, golden brown tint that accentuates his large muscular frame. His hair was thick, black and slicked down with both sides of his head shaved. Bane also had a black bushy beard decorating his face. It was hard sometimes to take him seriously with the beard because it kind of makes him look like a big old teddy bear, but if the rumors were true, you definitely shouldn't say that to his face, not unless you wanted to end up in A&E. He wears a plain white wife-beater that's low enough to show the hairs on his chest, and a long black necklace rests on his chest that looks like a triskelion. He wears black tight jeans with black ankle boots with a small heel.
I look over at Silver who walks on the far right corner and just blatantly stare at her. Every girl wants to be her, and every guy in this school wants to date her, but everyone knows that she's in love with Ryder. The way she looks and smiles at him with her perfect teeth and her perfect body. She has a heart-shaped face with pale, smooth skin and bright blue eyes. Her mouth is full and perfectly shaped which helps accentuates her pouty lips. Her long wild, black untamed hair rests on her left shoulder and hangs down by her waist. Her build small but muscular.
Rumours say that she kicked a jocks ass once after he slapped her ass. He left in an ambulance, and didn't return to school until the next month. No one ever touched her again. Not after that. She wears a black leather jacket that cuts to her waist, plain black shorts, and black thigh high boots.
The kindest looking one out of them all is Kellan. It seems kinda odd to see him with these people. He has an oval shaped face with creamy fair skin, dark brown eyes that look haunted but yet gentle at the same time. His face holds no expression which makes it hard to determine whether he's happy or sad. Curly brown hair frames his perfectly shaped face. He wears a black stretcher in his left ear with both of his arms covered in colourful art. His body slim with no ounce of body fat, just pure muscle. He wears a plain black wife - beater, tight black jeans and black sneakers. Kellan just might be the only approachable one out of them all. He has this kind aura about him that draws people in, and it makes it impossible to dislike him. I remember when he and his girlfriend were together. Anna was one of the sweetest girls in this school, and every single person here respected her and treated her with the utmost kindness, but Kellan lost the love of his life over a year ago. Her body was found by the river near the creek in the early hours of the morning.
People say that the crime scene was like something out of a horror film. Nevertheless, Kellan lost a part of himself after losing Anna, and I didn't blame him.
â€œWhat makes her so special? I bet she has like a magic vagina or something plus, she's probably slept with all three of them.â€
I look away from Kellan just as he passes by us, and gasp at my best friend. â€œSam, stop staring before she beats you up as well as you ending up in the hospital!â€
â€œWhat? It's not like she can hear me.â€
I grab Sam's hand and drag her down the corridor towards our English class. We take our seats near the front row, take out the reading book and wait for Mr Daniels. â€œHonestly, I guarantee you that she's sleeping with one of them.â€ Sam points with the tip of her pen to the back of the class without looking back. I look over my shoulder towards the back and see the four of them sitting together, but neither of them speak to each other. Silver sits beside Ryder as always. She always remains by his side.
I look over at Ryder, his expression remaining impassive as Silver strokes his arm compassionately. Anyone could tell just by looking at her that she's in awe of him. Kellan on the other hand, remains silent and sits with his elbows on the table, his head resting between them. Bane sits with his legs crossed on top of the table with his hands resting behind his head. He looks around the room like he's observing everything around him. Only then did it hit me. â€œSam!â€ I hit her hand as I'm turning around and accidentally knock the pen out of her hand.
â€œThat's my favourite pen.â€ She points down towards the floor. â€œIt never hurt anybody.â€
â€œAre they even supposed to be in this class? Why am I only realizing this now?â€ I motion towards the back and tilt my head to the back of the room.
â€œIt's the middle of senior year so...no. The school doesn't let people change course in the middle of the year but I don't know. Maybe they worked something out with Mr Daniels?â€
She picks up her pen and inspects the damage â€œYou owe me a new pen by the way. This fountain pen was a gift I got on my birthday.â€
â€œYeah, sure.â€ I look towards the back of the class again, only to realize that they're all staring back at me. They really were intimidating.
Silver tilts her head to the side and stares at me with a hateful glare, while Bane's jaw ticks.
I knit my brows and look towards Kellan. He smiles a small smile, his eyes crinkle at the sides when I smile back at him. He only smiles for a second, then looks down at his desk again. I move my head completely to face Ryder, and for the first time in years, I really take a good look at him.
He has a chiselled shaped face with tanned spotless skin. Emerald green eyes that keep you staring, but his eyes hold no threat nor hatred, just a pure curious stare. I look at him as he stares back at me to see him smirking. His lips are full, yet firm.
I bet he's kissed a lot of girls with those lips...
After adjusting his beanie, he slicks his shiny black hair to the side and sticks his tongue out at me. I knit my brows in confusion again, and turn around, â€œAsshole.â€
As I face the front of the class all I hear is Ryder laughing from the back.
Shit! Can he lip-read!?
â€œWho's the asshole?â€ Sam looks around the room to find the culprit but only finds me staring at her.
She points to herself in panic. â€œIf this is about the pen don't worry about it.â€
â€œNo it's nothing. I'm just not up for work tonight.â€ I pick up the book and skim over the blurb.
â€œBehind on homework? I can help you at the diner tonight if you want?'
â€œThanks, but I'm sure I'll be able to catch up on time.â€
I pull out a pen from my pencil case just as the door to the classroom opens.
Is Mr. Daniels off sick today?
â€œGood morning students, my name is Mr Edmund, and I will be your English teacher for the rest of the school semester. I believe you are reading the novel Wuthering Heights. Can anyone volunteer to start us off?â€
He writes his name on the whiteboard as Oliver Edmund. â€œWhere's Mr. Daniels?â€
â€œI'm not obliged to share that information with you, Ms. Frey.â€
He turns around, and stares at Sam with his cold demeanour.
â€œSir? We were promised to have our test results back today.â€
This practice test was everything I needed to pass for next weeks exam. If I'm going to fail another class, I'm not sure I'm going to survive the rest of senior year.
â€œAlice, isn't it?â€
