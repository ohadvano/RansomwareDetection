NATURAL BIRTH CONTROL





There are many forms of birth control which are harmful to the

human body, some of these forms which I would not recommend

are:



Birth control pil s, which are steroids, they act by preventing

ovulation and are almost 100% effective, but have many side

effects and are harmful to the body. Spermicides in the form of

foam, placed in the vagina prior to a intimate relationship, act by

kil ing the sperm are also harmful to the body. lUD's or intrauterine

contraceptive devices, are plastic or metal objects (usual y copper)

that are placed inside the uterus. They act by preventing the

fertilized egg from attaching itself to the lining of the uterus. These

are foreign objects that are within the body and often the body wil

try to reject the IUD causing side effects. Diaphragms are dome-

shaped pieces of rubber with a flexible spring circling the edge. It is inserted into the

vagina so as to cover the cervix and must be used in conjunction with a chemical spermi-

cide. Tubal ligation involves surgical division of the fal opian tubes and ligating the cut

ends. This form of sterilization is effective but virtual y irreversible and causes many

problems as each month the eggs are unable to be discarded the normal way through the

vagina and must be absorbed into the blood stream and eventual y eliminated by the

kidneys. Vasectomv consists of cutting the vas deferens and tying each end so the sperm

can no longer travel from the testicles to the urethra. This form of sterilization is effective

but also can cause problems.



One form of birth control which is not natural, but causes no harm to the body, is a

condom. They can be made of rubber or animal membranes. I do not recommend using

the animal membranes. This is a highly reliable means of contraception.



Natural Ways of Birth Control Are:



Calendar Rhythm Method

Over the years, the rhythm method alone has proven to be only 60-80% effective.

Ovulation occurs approximately 2 weeks prior to the next period. Fourteen days is the

average, but it can occur 12-16 days before the fol owing period. If you had a list of your

previous cycles for 12 months (the more the better) you wil be able to determine if you

have a 28 days cycle, or if it is longer or shorter that 28 days. You then count back 14

days from the start of your period and that is the time of ovulation when a pregnancy can

occur.



In order for a pregnancy to occur a fresh, live sperm from the man must meet and

fertilize a live egg from the woman. This can only happen during the few days in the

woman's fertility cycle. Pregnancy can happen if there is an intimate relationship at the



151

exact time of ovulation. It is also possible to get pregnant up to 72 hours before ovulation.

The sperm normal y lives 2 or 3 days (possibly up to 5 in ideal situations). Since the egg

can live from 12-24 hours a person needs to abstain for 24 hours after ovulation. In order

to avoid pregnancy, a couple must abstain for 3 days preceding ovulation and 1 day after

(see chart on page 2).



This method would be very simple if we could pinpoint the exact time of ovulation

each month. Since we can only estimate the approximate time of ovulation we need to

al ow some extra leeway for error. Sickness, travel, worry, excitement, etc. can cause an

irregular cycle once in a while for most women, and often for a few women.



Researchers found that conception was more common from early

winter to spring (October to March). The most fertile month was

November. (British Journal, 297:1,309-10)





Cervical Mucus Method



In the female, cervical mucus is being created al the time by special cel s inside the

cervix and changes character during the monthly cycle. You may have noticed this normal

discharge and wondered why it was so profuse at times and absent at other times. You

wil find this mucus at your vaginal opening you do not need to check inside.





In the beginning and end of the cycle (the safe time) when the hormone estrogen is

low, the mucus is scant, sticky and opaque with cel ular matter. In the middle of the cycle

(the unsafe time) it changes to fertile type mucus. As the estrogen level increases,

preparing for ovulation, the quantity of mucus increases. It becomes thinner and milkier.

Then, with more estrogen, it gets clearer and more watery. At the estrogen peak, right

before ovulation, it gets slick and glassy and you may be able to stretch an unbroken

shimmering thread of it between your thumb and forefinger.



At this fertile time, the mucus has usual y increased to ten times what it was earlier.

This abundant fertile mucus is helpful to the sperm. It nourishes them, guides them

upward through fiber -like channels, and protects them from the acid ph of the vagina (the

mucus is alkaline.



After ovulation, the hormone progesterone causes the mucus to change to an

infertile type within a day or two. Progesterone inhibits the mucus-producing cel s of the

cervix and the mucus again becomes scant, thick, sticky, and opaque white or yel ow from

cel ular matter and protein content. After the fertile phase, the mucus wil return to the dry

or sticky type. Note: Check mucus at times when not ready to have an intimate

relationship as this wil produce lubricating mucus which is not the same as cervical

mucus.





SPERM CAN LIVE UP TO 5 DAYS. EGGS LIVE FROM 12-24 HOURS.





Basal Body Temperature Method



A reproductive hormone that is released after ovulation causes the body

temperature to rise several tenths of one degree over what it was before ovulation. To

avoid pregnancy, the safest time to have an intimate relationship is after you are sure you



152

have already ovulated. You wil have relatively low temperatures from the time of your

period until you ovulate. Ovulation wil cause a rise of about 6/10 of one degree. This rise

can happen in a day or it can stair-step up over a period of several days. After you have

recorded four consecutive days with a temperature that is higher than your normal

temperature then it is a safe time.



You must remember that five days prior to ovulation when the temperature is

normal is an unsafe time due to the fact that sperm can live up to 5 days.



If you want the absolute surest, most infallible form of natural birth control,

you only have an intimate relationship in the later part of the cycle (after the

rise in temperature for four consecutive days) until the time of the period. The

unsafe time being from the period to ovulation.





Note: Take your temperature within an hour of the same time each morning upon

awakening, If you sleep late, your temperature could show a false rise. Use a Basal

Thermometer, which measures in l/10th degrees instead of 2/10th degrees like a regular

thermometer. You should take your temperature rectal y or vaginal y rather than by mouth

because it is more accurate. A very important aspect of this method is keeping good

charts and records.



Herbs





Wild yam root contains diosgenin, used to manufacture progesterone. Most of the

steroid hormones used in modern medicine, especial y those in contraceptives, were

developed from elaborately processed chemical components. It is best to take this herb in

tea form, one glass just before bed each night. Use distil ed water or reverse-osmosis

water, bring to a boil, remove from stove, add 1 - 2 teaspoons of the herb and let steep for

20 minutes or longer.

OVERWEIGHT





Sixty-two percent of the American people are overweight -

that is more than one out of every two people in the United States!

Since intemperance in eating is such a major problem, I feel

compel ed to write about it. After twenty years of dieting, says a

national survey, the average American is now five pounds heavier.

The American Seating Company, one of the world's leading chair

manufacturers, has widened their standard seats by two inches to

accommodate the ever expanding American.





People are concerned about their weight. According to a

recent survey commissioned by the Calorie Control Council, 40 -

50 percent of those between the ages of 35 and 59 years old were

dieting. There is a difference between being overweight and being obese. If you can pinch

an inch of fat at your lower rib, you are overweight; and you are obese if you are 20% or

more overweight.



For every extra pound of weight, you shorten your lifespan by one month; so

someone who is 24 pounds overweight would die 2 years sooner. If you are obese, you

have a three times greater chance of having heart disease, are five times more likely to

develop diabetes, and are more likely to develop osteoarthritis and low back pain. You are

also more likely to develop cancer of the colon, breast, prostrate, cervix, uterus, and

ovaries. As the statistics plainly show, being twenty percent or more overweight, wil not

produce good health.



The reason that 62% of the people in this country are overweight is because of our

traditional eating habits. Americans eat a hearty breakfast, a hearty lunch, a hearty dinner,

and snack the rest of the time. Far more time is spent appropriating than eliminating, so

we carry around much excess fat.



Mankind believes that he can put large amounts of natural or unnatural foods into

his body and not have to take the blame for the sickness he brings upon himself by his

own improper choices.



If we eat three meals a day, we should have three eliminations a day. When natural

elimination is made difficult, then a special method for cleansing the body of these toxic

wastes is put into action, through sneezing, colds, discharges from the nose & eyes,

sores, and skin diseases of many kinds, such as pimples, boils, abscesses and ulcers.



Poor eating habits, and the taking of drugs, prevent or hinder our body from

keeping our system clean. Many of these toxins end up being stored in our bodies as fat,

or in our organs such as our kidneys as kidney stones, or in our gal bladder as gal stones;

or our arteries become plugged with arterial plaques which can cause a heart attack or



154

stroke. Al of these diseases, and many more, are the result of improper eating which

causes a high toxic build-up in the body.



It is important to realize that the body fluids, which contribute to the life processes,

are al alkaline except for the gastric juice;, and that the waste fluids are al acid, such as

the urine, perspiration, etc.. These acid products must be eliminated because the healthy

state of the body is one of alkalinity. If the tissues of the body become acid, il ness occurs.

This toxic acid build up in the body is the result of eating too many concentrated foods.

Ideal y, we should be eating a diet that consists of 80% alkaline forming foods, 20% acid

forming foods, as wel as a limited amount of high concentration foods (i.e. those

containing low water content).





First, let's look at some foods that are acid forming: meat, eggs, al grains (except

mil et and buckwheat), and al nuts (except almonds and brazil nuts). These foods should

make up 20% of our diet, except for the meat and eggs, which we should not use. The

other 80% of our diet should be made up of al alkaline-forming foods, which are fresh

fruits and vegetables. Concentrated foods (those with low or no water content) should be

eaten in limited amounts, whereas fresh fruits and vegetables have a high water content

and can be eaten in large amounts. Since our bodies are composed of a high percentage

of water, then we need to eat large amounts of fruits and vegetables which are also a high

percentage of water. This water in the food we eat transports the nutrients in the food to

al the body's cel s, and in turn removes toxic wastes.



So we see then that for optimum health we need to be eating meals that consist

largely (80%) of fruits and vegetables, and 20% of acid forming foods such as grains and

nuts; and that the concentrated foods (foods low in water) should be eaten in limited

amounts. As you eat more natural fresh foods, your caloric intake wil become less, but yet

you wil feel ful . For example, one apple has 80 calories, is 83% water, and is alkaline, as

opposed to l/6th of an apple pie, which has 405 calories, is quite low in water content, and

is both alkaline (apples) and acid (the crust). If we fol ow these guidelines, our

eliminations, in time, wil become normal, our body wil be able to get rid of the large

amounts of excess weight and toxins, and we wil start feeling great and losing weight.



So far, we have looked only at the physical disadvantages of being overweight; but

what about the mental disadvantages. Overweight or obese persons, as a general rule,

are insecure; they don't feel accepted because of their weight. They are not happy

inwardly, even though many try to put on an outward show. They are not as ambitious

when it involves physical activities. They are not happy with themselves because of their

weight problems; and consequently they usual y are not happy with others. They also tend

to be highly emotional; and most are unable to control their tempers.



These are just a few of the mental disadvantages associated with being overweight

or obese. I personal y believe that through the power of prayer, and fol owing God, a

person can get the victory and wil become temperate in their appetite; and this wil

change them spiritual y, mental y, and physical y. Then they can be the happy, healthy

person God has always wanted them to be.



.





155

It takes wil power and determination with God's help, to overcome appetite. Just

like any other habit you want to overcome, you must plan your strategy so you wil not fal

again and again and again. What can I do when those hunger pangs strike and I am

tempted to be intemperate? Drinking a glass of water can displace cravings for food.

Since dehydration encourages cravings for food, it is vital to consume adequate water

every day. You wil find that if you drink your water quota between meals (a minimum of

eight (8) glasses daily, you wil feel satisfied and be less likely to crave food between

meals.





Because exercise helps to curb hunger, taking a brisk walk outside in the fresh air

is an excel ent aid. During working hours or whenever time is limited, even a few minutes

spent deeply breathing fresh air can rejuvenate you and take your mind off food. Diversion

tactics are also helpful, such as going to visit a friend, working in the garden, or shopping.





First of al , exercising in the morning increases the body's metabolism, causing the

body to burn calories at nearly twice the rate for the next six hours. Exercise gears up the

body's metabolism, and increases its ability to "burn" calories. Exercise should be a main

component in any weight-loss program.

OLIVE OIL





Many health enthusiasts advocate the use of olive oil in the diet, and claim that it is

not harmful to the body as other fats. Olive oil is great for the outside of the body, but not

for the inside, as it is no different from any other refined oil. It is 100% fat. You wil never

find a more natural lotion than COLD PRESSED OLIVE OIL or FRESH ALOE VERA. It

wil do wonders for your skin. I have found that it helps with sore muscles, inflamed joints,

arthritis, etc.

Regular olive oil wil not work; it must be cold pressed. Heating destroys the oil.

Most manufacturers use the cheapest and quickest way possible of processing the oil.

The method most commonly used includes crushing the olive, mixing it with water, then

heating it at 230 degrees F for 30 minutes. Fol owing this, the crushed olives are run

through a press that exerts ten to twenty tons of pressure per square inch. The result of

this great pressure is the exposure of the oil to a great amount of heat and the destruction

of the natural elements found in the oil of the olive.

The natural oil that is found in the olive has to be extracted mechanical y without

heat to produce cold pressed olive oil. If you are not sure that the olive oil you purchased

is cold pressed, there is a simple way to find out. Put your bottle of olive oil in the

refrigerator (not freezer) and let it sit overnight. If it turns cloudy it is cold pressed. When

you rub cold pressed olive oil on your skin, within a half hour it wil be absorbed into your

body and your skin wil not feel sticky or greasy. If you rub regular olive oil on your skin, it

wil stil be there half an hour later. The heating process destroys the natural health

producing properties of the olive oil.

While I am on the subject of oils, I want to share with you information on linseed oil,

and cod liver oil. Linseed oil comes from the flax seed, which is a weed, not a grain. Some

bakeries put ground flax seed in bread or cereals. Those who do this do not know food

chemistry and its relationship to body chemistry. Flax contains cyanide. The leaves and

seed chaff contain the cyaniogenetic clycoside, linamarin. An enzyme (linamarase) is

present in the plant material which is capable of releasing cyanide from linamarin. Cases

of poisoning after ingestion of linseed cake, meal, or flax seed chaff have been reported in

al classes of livestock. Symptoms and lesions are those of cyanide poisoning(1).

What about cod liver oil? Leave it alone! It is from an animal source, and, for that

reason, is of more harm than benefit. I believe God wants us to use only those things that

wil promote good health. Today we should benefit greatly if we were to use on our skin

cold pressed olive oil instead of al the man-made greasy chemical creations.

OSTEOPOROSIS





What is osteoporosis? How do we get it? Can we prevent it through natural means?

Are there natural ways to treat and reverse it? Do we need to fear it? Is more calcium the

answer?

Our bodies are made up of a number of elements. The two most prevalent minerals

in bones are calcium and phosphorus. When calcium is lost from the bones over a period

of time, the bones become porous and brittle and can easily break. This is osteoporosis, a

loss of weight and density in the bone cel s, and the development of a spongy rather than

solid texture of the bones.

The disease actual y consists of two aspects, the loss of bone material resulting in

an enlargement of the spaces in bones. With less material, the appearance of the bones

becomes porous. What looked solid like rock now appears as a sponge.



IS MORE CALCIUM THE SOLUTION?

Very often we have been told that increasing the intake of high-calcium sources,

such as dairy products, wil both prevent and reverse osteoporosis. Is this true?

Two investigators, doing independent research, suggested at the meeting of the

American Society for Bone and Mineral Research in 1986 that dietary calcium bears no

relationship to the development of osteoporosis(1).



Michael Parfitt, osteoporosis researcher at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan,

observes that the 1984 National Institutes of Health (NIH) panel report, recommending the

use of calcium to prevent osteoporosis, is based on weak evidence(2).

B. Lawrence Riggs, Mayo Clinic researcher, reported a study of 107 Rochester,

Minnesota women, 23 to 88 years old. Dr. Riggs fol owed them for 4.3 years, with

repeated measurement of their bone density. Calcium consumption in the study group

ranged from 269 to 2000 mil igrams daily, but the researchers could demonstrate no

relationship between bone loss and calcium intake, even on the lowest calcium intake(3).

Dr. C. Christiansen from Gosstrup Hospital in Denmark reported a two-year study in

which 43 women were placed on calcium supplements, placebos, or estrogen. Calcium

was ineffective in preventing bone loss(4).

Dr. Mazees states that in population studies adjusted for body size and ethnic

origin, individuals with high calcium intakes did not have denser bones than those on low

calcium intakes(5).

Dr. Richard Mazeses of the University of Wisconsin cal s calcium "the laetril of

osteoporosis11, and points out that there are no studies evaluating the safety or efficacy

of calcium supplements. It is known that high calcium intakes can interfere with vitamin D

utilization (also necessary for bone cel formation), and may cause kidney stones (6) .

Approximately 20 mil ion people in the United States are affected by osteoporosis.

Most of them do not understand why they are suffering with this disease. Many of these

people are taking calcium supplements, and believe that this should relieve their

problems. Calcium supplement sales were estimated to have reached 166 mil ion dol ars

in 1986(7).



159

Tragical y, most of these people should not be using this extra calcium, for excess

calcium in the body has several adverse side effects. It has been shown that excessive

calcium is picked up by the blood and deposited in the soft tissues, the blood vessels,

skin, eyes, joints, and internal organs. Little wonder we suffer.

In the blood vessels, calcium combines with fats and cholesterol to cause

hardening of the arteries. In the skin, excessive calcium causes wrinkling. In the joints it

crystal izes and forms very painful arthritic deposits. In the eyes, it solidifies into cataracts.

And in the kidneys, it forms hard deposits known as kidney stones. Thus it becomes

evident that taking extra calcium does much harm, rather than benefit to the body.



WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF OSTEOPOROSIS?

The major cause of osteoporosis is eating too much protein, especial y in

combination with fat, such as is found in meat and animal products. Most Americans, as

they enjoy their steaks and hamburgers, are eating far too much protein At present, the

World Health Organization suggests a minimum daily protein requirement of about 40

grams. The RDA recommendation is about 55 grams a day. But the average American is

getting over 100 grams a day.

What happens to al this excess protein? First it is broken down into amino acids,

some of which are metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys as urea.

Along with the urea and amino acids excreted into the urine go large amounts of minerals.

One of the minerals lost is calcium; and studies show that the more protein you use, the

more calcium you lose.

The many studies performed during the past fifty-five years consistently show that if

we want to create a positive calcium balance that wil keep our bones solid, then the most

important dietary change that we can make is to decrease the amount of protein we eat

each day.

Some other causes of osteoporosis are smoking, drinking alcohol, coffee, soft

drinks, eating too much salt, taking antacid, insufficient exercise, and lack of sunshine.
