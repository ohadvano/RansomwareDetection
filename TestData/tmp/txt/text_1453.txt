“Remember what I said.”
He stands from the table and leaves with his Betas in tow. I sigh and turn back around.
“Everything okay?” Max looks at me with concern on his face.
“Yeah, everything's fine.” I stand from the table and grab my bag off the floor. “If you want I can show you where the basketball court and gym is?”
He looks at my half-eaten plate. “You've barely eaten anything.”
“I've lost my appetite.”
We leave both of our trays on the table and leave the cafeteria.
Our school campus is huge and there would be no way in hell that Max could find the gym on his own. I lead him towards the back of the campus where the football pitch and the basketball court is, and see people there already changed for practice including Ryder, Bane and Kellan. I ignore them and move to the door leading to the changing rooms.
“So, here we are. The changing rooms are through there and there's another door on the end leading to coach's office.”
