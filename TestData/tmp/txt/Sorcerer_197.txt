Alarmed, the Riverwench looked down and saw black, rubbery matter around her foot. Kiran fired a second shot that glued her other foot to the ground. The human carefully climbed down the tree as the Riverwench tried to twist her feet free, but the wounds dealt by Gatril stole the strength from her muscles.
Seizing the chance, Gatril spat acid on the Riverwench’s right shoulder. She screamed and leered at the bosdrake. “I’ll kill you!”
Kiran went over to Gatril and shouldered some of her weight on him, gently lifting her. “Are you alright?” he said.
“I’ll be fine once we get to screw her,” said Gatril. Then she turned to the giant. “Hey, you!”
The Riverwench ignored them and continued to try and free her foot. Her arm strength wasn’t up to par thanks to Gatril strategically targeting her shoulder. Finally giving up, the Riverwench knelt and her hands and knees, breathing heavily.
“Curses…” she sneered. “To be beaten by the likes of prey like you. Go ahead, finish me.”
“No,” said Kiran. “That’s not what I’m here for.” Kiran wasn’t a man with a lust for blood, but he had to remember the monster wasn’t innocent. “I’m a sorcerer. I need your queex in order to complete a spell.”
“Sorcerer,” said the Riverwench. “Of course. You used magic. What…is my queex?”
“The juice from your womb,” said Kiran. “If you allow me to mate with you, I’ll set you free. So long as you move somewhere else where you won’t hurt selkies or humans.”
The Riverwench made something between a scowl and a frown. “You, mate with me? Absurd! It would be a disgrace to let my prey mount me. I rather die than be humiliated!”
“Really?” said Gatril. “Are you sure your life is worth less than swallowing a human cock?”
The Riverwench looked at the bosdrake, then the human. Both of who wore spiteful grins. She weighed her option, and the large female hung her head and growled. “Very well. If you promise to set me free, I’ll allow you to mate with me.”
“Definitely,” said Kiran. He gave his weapon to Gatril and took a jar out of his backpack. “Since you’re already on your hands and knees, just hold still.”
Kiran made his way around the back of the Riverwench, while Gatril kept a watchful eye on her. Kiran took off his pants and faced her behind, met with her vagina presenting itself to him. Knelt over like this, the Riverwench’s bottom reached just below Kiran’s chest, and he stooped to plan his face in her crotch. 
She had a slight fishy smell mixed with garlic and honey, which translated over to the taste when Kiran stuck his tongue inside her. The Riverwench shuddered as Kiran’s tongue slithered inside her, flailing against her clitoris like a slippery fish. She tried to bite back her moans to deny the human the satisfaction of pleasuring her, even going so far as to cover her mouth. She gripped the dirt in her hands as her body contorted, making guttural sounds as the human licked, sucked and drank from her. But Kiran was too much, and is no time the Riverwench dropped her hand and uttered a deep, long groan. 
Her body practically quaked as her queex poured into the jar and all over Kiran’s face.
“Whoa!” said Gatril. “She couldn’t handle it.” 
The Riverwench hung her head between her arms, closing her eyes in embarrassment. “Damned human…”
Gatril walked around to where Kiran was, and said, “The air smells strong from the queex. Let me try some.”
The Riverwench abruptly lifted her head. “What?”
Without warning Gatril licked the female’s labia and shot her tongue inside with electrifying grace. She grabbed the Riverwench’s bottom and held her steady as she contorted out of control, still sensitive from Kiran’s first round. 
“In that case,” said Kiran as he corked the jar and put it away in his backpack, “I’ll deal with you face-to-face.”
Kiran went to the Riverwench’s head and held her cheeks. She spotted the reddish tip of his veiny manhood and shuddered. “W-What are you doing?”
“Just letting off some steam,” said Kiran. “You don’t want to?”
Gatril nibbled on her clitoris and the Riverwench abruptly reeled like a horse, falling back on her hands. “P-Please!” she said. “I won’t eat humans or selkies anymore! This is embarrassing! Just let—”
Kiran silenced her by ramming his phallus into her mouth. The Riverwench choked and grabbed his waist to prevent him from thrusting, but her last orgasm left her a tad weary, powerless to stop Kiran from pounding her face. His balls slapped against her chin, and he closed his eyes and threw back his head as his mind melted away.
“Wow, you have a good mouth,” Kiran said, but his sex mate could only reply with garbled sounds and saliva running from her mouth. 
The Riverwench’s body shuddered once again as another orgasm consumed her. She clenched Kiran’s waist tighter to the point where he felt he was going to break.
“Ouch!” he said. “Hey, careful!”
Gatril took her face out of the Riverwench’s behind, licking the excess fluids from her lips. “Hey, Kiran. I’m hot over here.”
Kiran stopped, the Riverwench sighed inwardly. “Okay. Come over here and I’ll help you out.”
Kiran pulled out of the Riverwench’s mouth. He let go of her and she laid her head on her arms. “I-I’m so tired.”
“Don’t worry,” said Kiran. “I’ve already got what I wanted.”
Gatril grabbed Kiran’s penis. “Yeah,” she said, “now you’re gonna give me what I want.”
Kiran and Gatril quickly finished up in the missionary position. His thrusts and her contractions produced and intense heat in their groins that had them climaxing almost instantaneously.
