“I've been hearing her crying in there for over an hour.” “You could have told me that earlier!”
“I was playing a game. I wanted to beat Bane because he kept kicking my ass!”
“I seriously couldn't care less! Just help me get her out!”
The door surprisingly opens and the first thing I see is Sam's tear stained face with mascara running down both of her cheeks.
“You guys are so loud I couldn't even concentrate on crying anymore.”
I pull her into my arms. “You scared the shit out of me when I couldn't find you. I started thinking the worst.”
She steps away and wipes her eyes. 'Tonight didn't go as I'd hoped, but I just wanna go home and get the hell away from here.”
Kellan grasps a hold of her hands and smiles reassuringly at her. “Ignore Bane and what he said to you because he's like that with everybody. Like a girl such as yourself, he was probably intimidated by your beauty.”
Sam smiles back at him but says nothing in response.
Is that a blush!?
“I think someone needs to lay off the alcohol	”
The door on the other end suddenly slams open with Bane rushing down the stairs, yelling at Kellan to follow him.
The three of us follow Bane outside where tons of people have stopped and created a circle around the campfire. It's hard for me to see what's going on inside the circle, but with Bane pushing his way to the front it soon reveals who is inside.
The first thing I see are two male bodies throwing punches at each other, when suddenly they both fall to the floor with their faces facing away from me. The larger one out of the two has black hair with a muscular build while the smaller one has golden hair.
The bigger male head-butts the other and gains the upper hand by sitting on top of the other male's abdomen and starts punching him repeatedly in the face. The smaller male lies unmoving on the floor as the dark haired male rises off the floor and roars in triumph, but when his green eyes meet mine, I freeze and run to the bloodied body lying on the floor.
I run past Silver where I see her applauding for Ryder with a smirk on her face.
Lying on his back in his own blood with his face unrecognizable is Max. His face covered with bruises and cuts that without knowing the colour of his hair, I wouldn't have been able to make out who the person was.
I kneel down beside him and feel completely relieved when I see his chest slowly rising and falling. I gently caress his bloodied cheek comfortingly, but when he tries to speak, blood pours out of his mouth.
“Shhh.” I plead. “Try not to speak, okay?”
I look around me to see people leaving to go inside the house to probably carry on with the party.
I can't believe that not one person stopped the fight. Why is it that a fight is seen as entertainment? People get severely hurt and for what? To show who's bigger or stronger? Who does Ryder think he is?
“Sam!” I call her name from my position next to Max.
The moment she comes over she gasps in horror at the sight in front of her. “Alice!?”
“Can you help me carry Max to his car please?”
I get up and ready myself to pick Max's beaten body off the floor when I hear Kellan call out my name from behind me. “Here let me.”
I watch as Kellan picks up Max effortlessly off the floor, and leads him into the forest and out to where his car is.
“Are you coming?” Sam stops in her tracks when she realizes that I'm not following her.
“You go ahead with Kellan. I'll be right behind you guys.”
I turn my back to her, and rush back into the house in search for Ryder.
Chapter 14

I ignore the fact that I have Max's blood on my hands, but that doesn't stop the blood from pumping in my ears and the feeling of adrenaline running through my entire body.
With Ryder nowhere in sight in the living area or the kitchen, I take the stairs and cross the right side of the room.
One of the previous doors that was closed is now empty which makes me turn to the other door that is closed shut. This gut feeling inside of me suggests that Ryder's in there - I stand corrected when I open the door to see that he's not alone. There's no jealousy or anger when I notice Ryder's body and a pair of legs wrapped around his waist, I feel only pity.
It's hard to see who the girl is, but there is no denying who might be kissing Ryder right now.
“You know, I genuinely feel sorry for you.”
Both heads swing towards the doorway, Ryder looks like he's seen a ghost while Silver looks like she wants to kill me for interrupting them.
“I thought you left.” Ryder gets up from the bed.
They may not have been sleeping together, but seeing them kissing each other, bothers me somehow, but I still can't stand to look at either of them.
“Oh no please, don't stop on my account seeing as you both don't give a shit that someone nearly died tonight.”
Silver laughs. “He deserved it. He accused Ryder, Bane and Kellan for something that they didn't do and came here unannounced. I mean seriously, he had it coming”
“Silver get out.”
Silver stops laughing instantly. “What?”
“Get the hell out!” Ryder yells, causing a shiver to run down my back.
Silver scurries to pick up her shoes off the floor and runs out of the room.
“Shut the door.” Ryder commands as he lounges on his black leather couch.
“No, I'm good here.”
I can sense that he's growing impatient with me but after tonight, he's changed to being a completely different person to whom I thought he was before, “Shut the damn door and sit down, Alice.”
“Don't tell me what to do! What you did tonight was brutal and horrific! Why would you do something like that!? Do you realize that Max could've died or do you not care at all? He's not an Alpha like you, so stop whatever grudge you have against him and let it go!”
Ryder doesn't say anything for a few minutes then shakes his head. “There's something wrong with him Alice and you refuse to see past the nice act he's putting on.”
“What? Max has been nothing but kind to me.” Ryder looks at me with a nasty scowl on his face.
“Explain the injuries then. Tell me that you're not curious about how he didn't have a scratch on him tonight.” “You mean before you decided to beat him up again.”
“I didn't beat him up the first time, but I wish I did because I'm telling you right now, he's a lying shit who's messing with the wrong people.”
I'm still curious about Max's injuries but I won't admit that to Ryder - I still haven't come up with an explanation on how it could've been possible, and so I refuse to give him the satisfaction of agreeing.
“Max's mother's a nurse, she probably...”
“Don't tell me you actually believe that!?” He interrupts me. “Why are you refusing to see what's actually in front of you!?”
“And what exactly is that?”
He shoves himself off the couch and storms towards me where I stand in the doorway. 'I don't know yet but I will! Give me a few days and I'll soon find out.”
“Sounds to me like you really want something to be wrong with him.”
Ryder leans down closer to me. “I do because I want him to stay as far away from you as possible.”
I shove his chest but I always seem to forget that his body is as hard as steel. “How can you say that!? You have no right to speak to me like that after what I saw you doing.”
He waves me off. “Silver's meaningless, and I have needs just like any other wolf does. Besides, it's not like I need to give you an explanation on who I'm being intimate with.”
“There'd be too many to count if I did ask you anyway.” I taunt.
It's silent for a few seconds then I take a deep breath. “I don't care that you've slept with Silver in the past because that's between you and her. I don't know why I came up here, but I know for one thing that I didn't like what I saw out there. For a second, I thought for sure Max was dead. Now there's something bigger going on in this town, and you're taking it out on some guy that has no idea about it. This shit with Max ends right now because when the next month is here we're gonna have another dead body. That's what we should be focusing on.”
My heart is beating by the time I finish talking, but I also feel relieved that I spoke freely about how I felt. I can't believe that a part of me feared about speaking my mind to someone like Ryder, but somehow I feel like I'm getting through to him slowly.
“I'm not promising anything Alice because if he gets in my way one more time, I'll do more than just throw in a couple of punches. He's up to something, and I'm gonna find out what it is. You need to open your eyes and see what kind of person he actually is before it's too late.”
It's my turn to shake my head. “You're wrong about him, but you're not gonna change the way you feel about him so it looks like I'm done here.”
I turn to walk away but stop when I hear my name coming from Ryder.
“What?”
“For once Alice, please listen to me on this.”
I don't answer him. Instead I walk down the stairs, ignore the people still dancing and evacuate the house. I pass the empty campfire and carry on walking into the woods and end up at the clearing. I spot Max's black Range Rover straight away and see Kellan pacing in front of the bright headlights.
A couple of steps towards the Range Rover, Kellan stops pacing and rushes towards me.
“How's he doing?”
All Kellan does is run his hand through his hair. “He's in a really bad way and he's losing a lot of blood. If we don't treat him soon it's gonna get worse.”
“I'll take him to my house, it's much closer than the hospital. My mom won't be there and I'll use her spare medical kit.”
I make my way towards the driver's side to see Max lying in the backseat with his head resting on Sam's lap.
As soon as I reach for the handle it's pulled back by Kellan's hand. 'I'll drive.”
“You've had a few drinks.”
“I have but now I'm sober. The alcohol wears off much quicker when you're a wolf.”
Well, that sucks.
The journey in the car was somewhat peaceful - no one spoke the whole time and in a way the silence was comfortable. I think all of us felt that silence was what we needed in that moment and as we arrived, the house cast in complete blackness was a welcoming feeling that I've longed for all day.
“You girls go inside and I'll bring him in.”
I place my hand reassuringly on his shoulder. “Kellan, you don't need to do this. You've done enough.”
“I might not like the guy, but he didn't deserve this.”
I rush into the house, turn on all the lights and look around for a place where Max can lie down.
Sam soon follows after with a distant look on her face. “Sam? You okay?”
She says nothing for a while then wipes her eyes, “This wasn't how the night should've ended.”
I grab the medical kit from under the sink and place it on the dining table. “You know, it's not your fault.”
“What's not my fault?” Sam crosses her arms over her chest.
“The situation with Bane. He's like that with everyone, and he won't change.”
She looks at me in disdain. “This isn't just about Bane. This is about how our friend almost got killed by a shapeshifter tonight, and to make things worse he doesn't even know that! Why are we associating ourselves with people like Ryder!? Before you got bitten, they didn't even know that we existed, and now they can't seem to stop following us. I'm going to be honest with you and say that I hate the fact that we now know about Mr. Daniels, and with what's going on in this town because I'm scared about what could be out there, whether it be something of the supernatural or not. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder in fear that something is coming after me.”
“Sam..”
Before I can respond to her, Kellan chooses that moment to bring in a bloodied Max into the house. I immediately guide him towards the dining table where he gently lays Max down on the table. I quickly wash my hands to avoid catching any kind of infection from the wounds Ryder inflicted on Max and rush back to the table.
“Do you need my help?” Kellan asks me just as I gently put pressure on the wounds with a sterile clean cloth to stop the bleeding.
“Thanks but I'm sure I can do it by myself being a nurse's daughter and all.”
I rush to one of the overhead cupboards and grab a bowl to fill up with water.
“If you need anything, just call me alright?”
Kellan disappears into the living room followed by a silent Sam.
I take the bowl to the table where Max silently lies and use the clear water to rinse the wounds on his face. Having no idea if open wounds are on his body, I take a pair of scissors from the medical kit and cut up the middle of his shirt. I close my eyes hoping that his body has been left unscathed, but when I open them, tears start to fall when I notice the purple bruises on both sides of his ribs.
With my fingers, I gently examine him to find out if there's any broken ribs, but sigh in relief when I don't feel anything out of place. I draw my attention back to his badly injured face and apply some antibiotic cream to help keep the cuts moist and to help the body's natural healing process. Through it all, Max doesn't flinch or show any kind of discomfort as I treat him.
I take out one of the chairs and sit next to him when suddenly he starts to stir. He looks around in confusion but soon relaxes when he sees me sitting next to him.
He sits up so effortlessly and hangs his legs over the table when he overcomes with dizziness, I rush to him quickly and hold his shoulders to help keep him from falling forwards. “You should be lying down.”
Max only chuckles. “Alice, I'm fine, honestly.”
“No, you shouldn't do this to yourself. Your body needs to rest.”
Max pulls my hands off his shoulders and cradles them in his palms. “I've done enough resting for tonight.”
“You didn't see what I saw back at the party. Nothing will make me forget what I saw.”
He strokes his thumb gently along my fingertips. “I'm sorry you had to see me in that state. Again.”
“That's the second time I've seen you covered in bruises and cuts, and I still don't know the reason behind it. You shouldn't mess with someone like Ryder, because he'll win every time.”
Max doesn't say anything.
“I'm sorry, I didn't mean to insult you.”
“No, I like the fact that you care about me. It's nice to know that somebody does at least.”
As a way of an apology I lean forward, clutch him tightly to my chest in a friendly embrace, but as I pull back, his face is inches away from mine. I stay rooted to the spot not knowing what to do, and before I have the chance to process what's happening, Max's lips meet mine.
I jerk my head back quickly and move to put some distance between us.
Max closes his eyes and shakes his head. “I'm so sorry. I don't know what I was thinking.”
“No it's fine. You don't need to apologise.”
Max avoids eye contact, looks down at the floor to realize that his shirt is torn.
“I had to cut your shirt to see if you had anything underneath that needed some treatment.”
“Thanks.”
He climbs off the table and stands with his hands in his pockets. “I should be going. It shouldn't have been your responsibility to look after me so I really appreciate it. So, thanks.”
I shrug. “It's no big deal. Yu're my friend and friends help each other.”
We stand in the kitchen in awkward silence, when I hear footsteps coming closer to where I'm standing. Kellan enters the kitchen, and leans against the door nodding in greeting at me and Max.
“Right, I think that's my cue to leave.” Max makes his way to the front door when I remember that I'm still wearing his leather jacket.
“Max, wait your jacket.”
The door closes and I'm left standing alone in the entryway.
“So, he kissed you huh?” Kellan says from behind me.
“You heard that?” I turn to Kellan with a look of fascination on my face.
Kellan scoffs. “I heard everything. It's hard to shut everything out when you have heightened senses. As a wolf, you should be able to experience it for yourself.” “I'm actually starting to think that I'm not a wolf.”
He frowns. “Why do you say that?”
“I don't feel any different at all. It's like the change never happened and I'm back to my normal self. Tonight I tried finding Sam by hearing her or finding her scent, but nothing.”
Kellan thinks for a moment. “That's not abnormal. For some wolves it takes time for them to learn and get used to their new abilities. Maybe that's why you're going through this. Trust me, it's nothing to worry about, but it's not something I can teach you.”
“Then who can teach me?”
“To be able to learn your new abilities, you're gonna have to go to someone with a lot of experience, and obviously that someone can only be an Alpha. So, Ryder's gonna have to teach you himself.”
Great...
Chapter 15

The house is silent and slightly cold, but that doesn't stop the thoughts from rushing inside my head. I'm far from happy about the fact that I'll have to learn the wolf way by someone that I can barely stand, let alone talk to.
There has to be another way surely?
I'd take lessons with Bane first before learning anything from Ryder after what I saw tonight. Max's face will again be on my mind for a while, and until I find out all the answers that are left unresolved, I'm left feeling incomplete - I can't think of anything as to why Ryder did what he did.
I lie wide awake in my bed when I hear the door to my house closing downstairs. I lie awake most nights just to hear my mum coming through that door at ridiculous hours, and yet she still returns to the hospital. She loves doing what she does best - the things she can do mesmerizes me.
I turn to my side; away from the door and shut my eyes ready for sleep to overtake me.
When I hear the door to my bedroom open gently, I smile happily to myself. Not once has my mother forgotten to check on me straight when she comes home. In a way, I think she does it to reassure herself that I'm still here with her.
She never says anything to me, she has a quick look to see if I'm asleep and then leaves quietly, and she never closes the door. So when I hear the door start closing and footsteps approaching my bed, I know something isn't right. I swiftly turn the lamp on placed on my bedside table and turn to face whoever's entered my room.
It doesn't matter how many times I see him, he'll always make me feel nervous, but for some reason seeing him here right now, makes me forget about the argument we had earlier.
Ryder stands unmoving in the middle of my room - his clothes soaked from the wet weather outside. He wears black skinny jeans with a white shirt sticking to him that makes out his bare muscular chest underneath. His hair is slicked back with droplets of rain falling every so often on his face, and he also breathes heavily like he's been running to get here.
I'm frozen from the position in my bed wondering what has brought Ryder here in the middle of the night.
“Ryder, what are you doing?”
“Is it true?” Ryder asks in a gravelly voice which in return makes my heart skip a beat.
It takes me a couple of seconds for me to answer him. “Is what true?”
Ryder crosses his arms over his chest, causing the muscles of his biceps to bulge through the sleeves. “What Kellan said to me.”
I shake my head. “It was no big deal. Max kissed me and...”
“That's not what I meant.” “Oh.”
“I was told that you don't feel as though you're a wolf.”
I don't hesitate. “Yeah, it's true. I don't feel any different. At all.”
Ryder thinks for a moment then goes to lean on the wall right beside my window. “You'll come to my house tomorrow.”
“Excuse me?”
Never in my life have I ever had someone order me around like that other than my mother.
I don't know whether I like it or not....
“You need to learn fast. The full moon is in two weeks and we can't waste another day. Now, this could be because you fought the first transformation, or it's just because you're shutting your wolf out without realising it. Trust me doing that is the worst thing you could do. If you shut her out she's just going to disobey you on every decision you make, and that will make her go feral.
Making her feral could result in you never changing back into a human.”
“It's not my fault that I can't summon her. I'm new to this and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong.”
Ryder slowly approaches the bed and stands at my side; looking down at me. “I'm not gonna to say that it's not your fault because it is and deep down you know it too, but you need to let her run free because it's what she needs and wants. She's probably pacing around right now in irritation with you, and I bet she's one pissed off wolf.”
I don't say a word as he talks to me about how it's my fault that I don't feel connected to my wolf like I should be. I know that it's my fault and I feel guilty about it, but with him reminding me all the time for making that wrong decision, it's just going to make me feel worse than I already do. I want her to run free and give her the freedom that she needs, but I'm consciously worried about someone or something hurting the two of us. I'm new to this whole thing so maybe showing up at Ryder's house tomorrow wouldn't be such a bad thing, I mean, I'll be learning how to be a wolf and I'll see what amazing things I can do just like Kellan told me.
“I don't want her to be pissed off with me. Ever.”
That's the last thing I'd ever want..
Ryder places his hand firmly on my thigh. “Come tomorrow and I'll teach you everything you need to know, and we'll take it slow and steady. Most likely she's gonna be hard work, and she's going to think that she's in control, and considering that you're an Alpha too, you're gonna have a short fused stubborn son of a bitch of a wolf on your hands. So, we're going to need numbers.” “You're making it sound like she's feral already.”
Ryder backs away to look out the window. “I can sense her emotions right this second, and I'm telling you she is not happy. I don't know how I didn't pick up on it sooner.”
“Is that supposed to make me feel better?”
A second ticks by when Ryder sighs. “Your mom's home. I better leave before she thinks her daughter's up to no good.”
The bright lights of the headlights shine on Ryder's form as my mother turns into the driveway.
I get out of the bed, approach Ryder and place my hand on his arm. “I'll be there.”
He looks at my hand wrapped around his arm, moves to look at me then nods. “Good.”
I drop my hand from his arm as he moves to open my window when I remember the conversation we had earlier, I call his name but he doesn't turn around.
“About tonight, I just want you to know that I don't judge you for what you did.”
He turns to face me with his piercing green eyes. “Which part? The one where I beat the shit out of your friend or the fact that you caught me kissing Silver?”
I'm taken aback and look at Ryder with a frown. “I don't judge you for kissing her.”
Ryder leans right into my face. “Then answer me this, why do I feel so guilty that it was you who walked through that door?”
Before I have a chance to reply, the door downstairs closes and our little moment is broken too quickly. He looks at me one last time, turns and jumps out the window. I rush to it just as I see him remove his shirt and running away from my home in the pouring rain.
I don't hear the door to my room open, I just stare into the night and at the spot where I last saw Ryder before he disappeared into the woods.
“Alice? You're awake.”
When I meet my mother's eyes she smiles warmly at me. “Yeah, I couldn't sleep.”
“You okay?” She looks at me with worry written on her face.
I turn away from the window to look at her. “Yeah, I'll be fine.”
“Well, I for one can't wait to lie down.”
I chuckle. “I bet it's been a long day for you.”
My mother shrugs. “It's what you sign up for if you wanna save lives, right?”
“Yeah, I guess.”
“How was the party? Did you have a nice time?”
I look back at the events of tonight and try to think of anything that did make it a good night, but I come up with absolutely nothing.
“It was okay. I didn't really stay there long.” “And Sam? Is she here or did she go home?” “She went home.”
“Oh, I thought she would've stayed here. I mean, she's always welcome to stay here. We've got plenty of room.”
I just nod. “I know.” “Okay, well goodnight.”
Just as my mother turns to leave my bedroom, I really want to ask her this one question.
“Mum?”
“Yes, honey.” She faces me with a tired look in her eyes but she still smiles.
“Do you know a woman who works at the hospital that has the surname Fields?”
She thinks for a few minutes while murmuring the surname to herself over and over again, then she shakes her head. “No.”
“Are you sure?”
She thinks for a little while then nods. “I'm absolutely positive. We have no one working at the hospital with that surname. I'm the person that's in charge of arranging the shifts, and I've never come across that name.”
My heart has already stopped beating as my mother confidently tells me that Max's mother does not work at the place like he said. I knew something was wrong the minute I saw him in that hospital chair and called his name to see an expression that looked a lot like he didn't want to be caught.
And now that I know the truth I can't help but think why he was there in the first place?
“Is there a reason for this, Alice?”
I smile at her reassuringly. “No, I just needed to know something that's all.”
“Well, I hope that it was useful information.”
My mother turns away and goes to her own room where she'll stay for the rest of the night.
“It was.” I say to myself just as I get into bed hoping to have any kind of rest to get through tomorrow's big day.
I was wrong.
Chapter 16

Arriving at Ryder's place early the next morning wasn't something I was looking forward to doing. I've realized that I'm giving a lot of my time to Ryder lately, and I'm starting to think that his presence doesn't bother me as much as it should. Although being around him makes me feel somewhat safe, I do believe that he can also be one of the most dangerous people if he was ever threatened, which takes me back to Max.
When I climb out of my mother's car and walk slowly towards the house, I can't help but feel anxious about how today's gonna go. Last night's revelation was unexpected, but my mother's words are still haunting me and because of that, I believe that things are going to be very different from now on.
As the house comes into view, it seems odd that I was only here last night. The place shows no sign that a party was being held here, so when I see the glass surrounding the house, I check around to see if anyone's nearby until I realize that nobody is around the property.
I'm not the type of person to just walk into a house like it's my own, so when my attention is drawn from the sound of a door closing I exhale in relief.
I see Kellan standing by the door, wearing nothing but black jeans, he smiles at me but it doesn't reach his eyes which immediately makes me think that something is bothering him.
When I meet him where he stands, he welcomes me with a hug that I instantly accept. We break away and I notice that he's looking at me in concern.
“You okay?” His question takes me back to last night where I see Max's bloodied body on my table and the truth about his mother.
“Yeah, I'm fine, you?”
“Last night was pretty rough with Max and everything.”
“It was, but what were we supposed to do?” I shrug. “I couldn't just leave him there besides, no one would've helped him if I didn't.”
Kellan remains silent as he takes in my whole appearance. “You look exhausted.”
I'm running on very little sleep but I refuse to let my tiredness get in the way of me today. I'm determined to learn about how to be a wolf and what it means to be one. Furthermore I decide not to tell him about what I've learned, so I just nudge him playfully. “I'm just nervous about today that's all.”
He chuckles in response. “You'll be absolutely fine. You've got Ryder, Bane and myself to look out for you.”
“Wait, it's not just going to be me and Ryder?”
Kellan turns to open the front door and indicates me to
follow him. “We all kind of have to be there in case you try to attack one of us, and because you're an Alpha female, you'll most likely try to take out Ryder.”
“So you're basically saying that I could kick Ryder's ass, then?”
Kellan looks at me in surprise. “She jokes! Didn't expect that to come out of your mouth.”
“It's true though, right? I mean, I don't know what she's gonna do when I shift.”
He stops walking and faces me. “From what I heard from Ryder about what she did when you shifted, she probably still has a grudge against him, so it's up to you to communicate with her and try to soften things with the Alpha male. Naturally, she's gonna want to dominate those around her because she's an Alpha, but that's where Ryder comes in.”
“And what's he gonna do?”
Kellan smirks and starts walking away. “He's gonna dominate you and make you submit to him.”
“He's gonna do what!?”
I march to keep up with his long strides while he laughs at me. “How is he gonna do that if she can't stand him!?”
From out of nowhere, I feel somebody walking behind me, I turn around and smack right into Ryder's bare chest - who wears nothing other than blue jeans.
Why all of a sudden was everyone half naked?
“If she submits to me then I won't have to fight or hurt her for dominance which I shouldn't have to do anyway.”
He leaves with Kellan through a door at the back of the house where it leads out to the garden. I quickly have a look at the house and notice the white walls completely bare of any pictures or memories of either one of the wolves, and it makes me feel quite unhappy. Happy or sad, everyone should have pictures up on the wall. Now that I think about it, maybe I don't know these people as well as I thought I did.
I stand in a big archway that gives the view of the living area that I didn't see last night. I was so oblivious last night that I didn't see the beauty of this room, I feel downhearted that I missed seeing what I'm looking at now. The living area is enormous and by enormous I mean I could fit my kitchen and living room in this space. A large television takes up the whole wall on one side of the room with all sorts of consoles placed neatly on the floor. Potted plants are placed on either side of a glass desk with an expensive looking laptop left untouched. Two black sofas are placed on either side of each other with a black coffee table sitting between them, but what draws my attention is the white marble fireplace placed at the back of the room with flames already ignited. A sheepskin rug lying in front of the fireplace - making it look so tempting to lie on right this second.
I jerk in surprise when I hear my name being called from outside and rush to catch up with everyone. The moment I step out I see that all the wolves have gathered outside; waiting for me presumably.
Bane stands with his arms crossed over his chest with a bored look on his face.
As long as he isn't sneering at me then I guess we're making progress. Kellan stands with his back to me looking out into the woods while Silver stands beside Ryder; looking flirtatiously at him. Ryder looks at me with an expression I can't figure out. I stare back at him, but look down when I notice Silver placing her manicured hand on his bare chest. Why all of a sudden do I feel so territorial?
After what happened last night between us, I would've thought that we had somewhat of an understanding with where we stood with one another, but with the looks of things, he's not quite ready to let Silver know how he really feels.
The silence is broken when unexpectedly a womanly gasp breaks the stare I have on Ryder's chest to see that he has a firm grip around Silver's throat. Silver looks at him in desperation to let her free but Ryder shows no sign of letting her go just yet. I look to see Bane staring at them with a disinterested look while Kellan places his hands on his hips waiting for this moment to be over.
“That's the last time you do something like that, understand?” Ryder says to her in a serious tone.
Silver looks taken aback as she stares back at him with a look of confusion. With what happened last night I'd probably have the same reaction, so I don't really blame her for that.
Doesn't make me pity her though!
He lets go of her throat causing her to stumble backwards and walks to stand in front of me.
“Today's all about you. It's a chance for you to let your wolf go and explore the areas around the property.
Hopefully, she'll gather a sense of freedom while she's at it.”
“What are you guys gonna do while she's exploring?”
Ryder points to himself. “I'll be following you at a distance. Far enough for me to know where you go.”
“Didn't Kellan say before that if she sees you she might attack you...again?”
Ryder takes in my appearance. “She can try.”
“Okay, whatever.” I shake my head in denial even though I know that Ryder is much stronger than I am, “Shouldn't our strengths be the same considering that we're both Alphas?”
The moment the word leaves my mouth, Silver and Bane both look at me with frowns written on their faces, while Kellan looks at their reaction with a grin.
Ryder crosses his arms over his chest. “Just because you're an Alpha it doesn't mean that you can easily overpower another”
Bane steps into our conversation. “How is this even possible?”
Silver spits on the floor. “She doesn't even have a pack to be an Alpha.”
Kellan snorts. “You're one to talk. You couldn't even control two wolves in your previous pack until your rank lowered of course.”
“You really wanna talk about rankings, you weakling?” Silver hisses.
Ryder grunts. “'Enough! We'll discuss this later but for now, I need everyone's attention.” He looks at his pack. “We don't know what's gonna happen when Alice shifts. I'm going to make sure that I'm in her line of vision when she does. I want you three to stay behind her at a distance. I don't want her attacking either of you so if it's me she goes for, I want you to let it happen, and don't interfere.”
Silver huffs. “You want us to just sit back on our asses and watch you get attacked by that feral thing!” She growls at me.
“Silver don't say things like that.” Kellan looks at me with pity.
“Why? We all know it's true so what's the point in denying it?” She squares up to Kellan. She's clearly showing that she's a much higher ranking wolf than him. “I mean, she'll probably be much stronger than you, and she hasn't been a wolf even for a week. That would really hurt your pride, wouldn't it?”
Kellan goes to speak but not before I say. “I can stick up for myself you know Silver, but thanks for the vote of confidence.”
Her eyes shoot to mine. “As if I'd ever stick up for you! You're a pathetic excuse for a wolf!”
“I said enough, Silver! If you don't want to cooperate, then I'd rather you leave.”
Silver frowns at Ryder. “Would you like me to leave?” Ryder doesn't hesitate. “Yes.”
She sneers at me before she runs away into the clearing with the sound of her clothes ripping just before she disappears. Bane watches Silver's every footstep until he nods at Ryder. “She's gone.”
Ryder moves to put his hands in his pockets, stares at me and sighs,. “Take off your clothes.”
Excuse me?
“I'm sorry what”' I look at the three of them in confusion. “You heard me. Strip.” Ryder bites his lip in anticipation. “Why would I do that?”
Ryder grins. “To shift.”
“You're crazy if you think I'd actually strip in front of you three.”
Kellan chuckles. “We've seen it all before Alice.”
I cross my arms against my chest. “No, I won't do it.”
Ryder rolls his eyes. “Do you want to let your wolf out today or not?”
“Well yeah but...”
At that moment Ryder starts to undo the button of his trousers with Kellan and Bane doing the same.
Wow...okay.
I put both of my hands up to halt their movements, “Wait! How do I actually shift if all of you shift before me?”
“My only advice for you is to not think too much about it. Just relax, calm your breathing, steady your heartbeat, and just let her come to you. She'll know what to do.”
No pressure.
“You know, I think what would be better is if I shift on my own without having anyone around. I want to be able to shift on my own without having an audience. I think she'll attack you guys if you surround her. She might think it's a threat, and I don't want anyone to get hurt because of me.”
“Fine. We'll do it your way, but as part of teaching your new abilities, I want you to come and find me.” Ryder winks at me just before he slides down his blue jeans along with his briefs.
Maybe I should have turned away when I had the chance because that image will forever be inside my head.
When I try to gather my thoughts after seeing Ryder's
naked body, I turn to see that Kellan and Bane have shifted already and started to run into the woods. I look back at Ryder when I find that I can't contain my breathing. The view right in front of me suddenly feels unrealistic.
He stands twice the size he was just now, I'd need to stretch my whole arm upwards to be able to touch his snout. He lowers his head as if he's studying me very carefully, and he probably recognizes my scent from before when I attacked him in Sam's house. I don't move a single muscle in case any kind of movement will aggravate the Alpha standing fearless in front of me.
A few minutes go by with him just staring intensely at me, a part of me is scared of what this beast might do to me, but I know Ryder wouldn't hurt me on purpose. Ryder takes one more look at me, turns around and follows the same footprints as Bane and Kellan.
I let out a breath of relief when Ryder's form disappears but I'm left feeling lost with what to do next.
I was told to keep calm but how can I when my heart is racing?
I hastily take off my white sandals, my white tank top and throw it to the floor followed by my ripped jeans. I look around consciously hoping that nobody can see me but relax when I realize that nobody would be out here, other than the occupants that live here. I undo the straps of my bra followed by my underwear and stand alone in the wolves' yard. I close my eyes to focus on slowing my heart rate and take deep breaths.
I repeat this until my breathing and heartbeat is slow and steady.
I take one last breath and lower my posture to be on my hands and knees when suddenly I feel as if I'm shrinking on the inside. I don't know how I brought this feeling onto myself, but knowing that I'm about to shift into a beautiful wolf excites me. I shake off the feeling of stopping everything and just try to relax when suddenly the feeling of needing to shiver comes unexpectedly, and without realizing what could happen next, the shiver takes over my whole body.
And the shift happens so effortlessly.
I don't feel any different other than having the feeling that I'm in a bubble. She stands to her full height, and after a while of getting used to the new height, I try to get her to move but she seems reluctant.
Move!
I try to communicate with her from inside my mind but she seems to be ignoring me or she doesn't understand.
Forward!
Again, she doesn't listen to me.
Instead, she moves towards the discarded clothes and stands in front of Ryder's pile. She lowers her head and starts to inhale the scent. I expect her to start growling from what happened when she was in his presence the last time, but what I don't expect her to do is lie on top of his clothes and start rubbing her scent over them.
What are you doing!?
She does it for a while but suddenly stops, she stares into the woods like she's trying to figure something out.
Did she hear something or did she sense danger nearby?
She slowly starts towards the clearing where all the wolves disappeared through and stop just outside it. The view before me is utterly breath-taking.
Tightly knit trees stare at me as though they seek permission from me to enter the forest. The scent of foliage mixed with decay and dampness tickle my senses, the bright sun above playing hide and seek in between the leaves of the trees. I don't realize that we've moved deeper into the forest until I hear a spine tingling howl coming from the other side of the forest.
When I think that she'll turn around, afraid of what she might come across, she instead decides to run towards the source.
We continue running until we come across the end of the path. She looks around at her surroundings - probably wondering where the howl came from. She inhales the ground when suddenly a noise of a twig breaks nearby. Her head shoots up in alert - waiting for a clear sign that she's safe.
Steady.
I don't know why I'm telling her to keep steady but with fur as white as snow and this height, there's no explaining to anyone about what they can see.
A few seconds go by when suddenly a fierce growl comes from behind us. In a second she turns around and faces whoever dared to approach her and the first thing I see are the blood red eyes of an Alpha and the black mass of fur. Ryder walks towards us with integrity - clearly showing who the strongest Alpha is. He circles around us, drawing closer and closer until the two bodies start to touch each other. All through this, she does not growl once. Instead, she lets the Alpha does what needs to be done.
After the close inspection, Ryder then starts to inhale her scent for a long time.
Will he attack when he realizes that she was the one who fought him or is it all forgotten?
He lifts up his head, moves to stand nose to nose with her and gently nudges his face against hers.
I'm taking this as a sign of truce.
Both Alphas seem to be happy in the company of each other when suddenly a gut wrenching howl comes from the wolves' house. Ryder looks down at the path and runs at a dead fast speed.
I take it as a sign to follow him but for some reason, seeing Ryder run off like that stirs an unwelcome feeling inside me.
Can Ryder sense something that I can't?
I reach the clearing just after Ryder and notice the three wolves standing in a half circle - looking down at something in the middle of them. The wolves turn around as if sensing that their Alpha is in their company, but when Kellan spots me, he growls at me as if warning me away.
I ignore it and follow behind Ryder.
He stops and stares at the scene in front of him. My heart stops when I see that a body lies unmoving on the ground. A bloodied body of a man lies on his front.
With the face hidden from view, I have no idea who the dead body belongs too.
Kellan rushes to stand next to me, urging me to leave, but I have no idea why.
There must be a reason otherwise he wouldn't be doing this.
All the wolves have gone quiet, and when I reach over to turn over the lifeless body, I can fully understand why.
Terry!?
Chapter 17

I'm standing underneath a spray of hot water in the wolves' bathroom, feeling like a knife's been shoved into my chest.
The second we saw Terry's body, we all shifted back and changed into our clothes and took in the mess in front of us.
There were no words to express how I felt in that moment when I looked at Terry's dead body. His throat slashed, body mutilated with blood spattered everywhere on the ground. Numb would be a reasonable answer, but the realization that I knew this man who's been somewhat of a father figure to me for all these years, makes the pain inside my chest a lot worse.
The question I keep asking myself is why target someone like Terry? He was a man who kept to himself and worked extremely hard at the diner to earn his way in life. There were days where he'd shout at the customers who would insult his cooking, but nothing to result in him getting killed.
Another dead body found yet it's the same month as Mr Daniel's death - could it be a different killer or has the motive changed? But what could've changed to make the killer target two innocent men who were kind and forgiving?
It's still hard for me to process the fact that Terry is now gone and that there won't be someone there who was like a father to me.
I'm engrossed at the scene in front of me but when I realise that Kellan's moved from his position to grab something in Terry's hand, it takes my attention away from the lifeless body. Kellan picks up what appears to be a piece of crinkled paper and hands it to Ryder. He looks at the paper handed to him, takes it from Kellan and opens it in silence. I watch Ryder's face changing a split second from having no emotion at all to anger.
“Ryder, you alright?” Kellan looks worryingly at Ryder. Ryder looks away, I can see him tensing his jaw. “What's wrong?” I look at the piece of paper.
He puts the crinkled paper in the back pocket of his jeans. “Nothing's wrong. Let's just do something about the body.”
I frown. “What does it say?” “I said it's nothing.”
“Ryder, it's obviously something to do with me otherwise you'd show it.” I snap.
Ryder turns his back on us. “Alice, just leave it, okay?”
I scoff. “What do you mean just leave it? Another body has been found, and this time it's on your property. You're standing there like it's no big deal!”
He swings back around. “No big deal? Do you think that I don't care that there's a dead body here? You're wrong to think that I don't give a damn about this! Not only do we have a murderer to look out for, but someone who wants to definitely pursue you.” Ryder takes the crinkled paper from his pocket, grabs my hand and slams the paper in my palm.
I turn over the paper and feel nausea creeping up on me. In black handwriting are the words 'Over the clothes you're definitely an eight, but without the clothes, you're a ten. I hope you don't mind that I took a few pictures' ending with a smiley face.
The tears start falling as I look repeatedly at the message personally written to me just minutes after I shifted, but another realisation hits me when not only has someone caught me changing, but that person has undoubtedly watched me shift in pure daylight, putting me and the wolves in danger.
I look around to try and gather some sense from where that person could've been hiding.
“I thought I was alone.” I wipe my eyes. “Obviously not.”
Bane speaks up for the very first time. “The property goes on for miles, and the fucker could've been hiding anywhere.”
“What if they're watching us right now, making it look like we did this to Terry?” I point at the body.
“They've got no evidence to prove that we had anything to do with this.” Ryder frowns down at the body. “But why here? Of all places, why place the body here?”
A few minutes go by without anyone talking.
Kellan speaks with a gentle voice. “I think I need to call my dad. A dead body placed on your property Ryder is something we can't handle ourselves. This person really wants us to get caught for this murder. My dad would say a murder like this, is definitely personal.”
Each and every one of us looks at the body in silence.
Silver growls. “Why are we just standing here looking at a dead body like it's gonna come back alive? We should be out there looking for this psycho right now because, for all we know, they could still be out there.” Silver points out into the forest.
More silence.
Ryder doesn't say anything for a while. “Kellan call your dad, but make sure he doesn't bring any reporters here.
The last thing I need is people pointing their fingers at me making me out to be the murderer.”
He dismisses Kellan and looks at both of his Betas. “I want you two to stay clear when Kellan's dad gets here. Do whatever you feel the need to do. Search the area, look for footprints, but for gods sakes don't shift. We don't want to add more fuel to the fire.”
Both Silver and Bane leave without a word.
Ryder comes over to me and rests his hands gently on my shoulders. “The cops will be here soon, searching the area for a few hours, but you can stay and get yourself cleaned up or I can take you home.”
My mother won't be home for a few hours and the thought of being alone especially with someone out there watching me sickens me. “I'll stay if it's okay with you. I don't want to be alone after...” I look over at Terry and feel my eyes welling up with tears again.
Ryder immediately pulls me into his arms in an embracing hug and holds me for a few minutes. “You can stay with me as long as you want. It's easier for me to protect you if you're with me.”
I wrap my arms around his neck and pull him deeply to me. It's the first contact I've had with another person since finding Terry, and it's all become very overwhelming.
Shortly after the moment with Ryder, I leave to go into the house and into the en suite bathroom in Ryder's room. I spend a good amount of time in the shower to gather my thoughts and think about what will happen when word gets out that Terry has become a victim of the murderer.
Something tells me that after this death, citizens are going to start noticing that people are going missing, but will the people of Small Town realize the danger they are in, or will they completely ignore the fact that there's a killer out there on a murdering spree?
I'm so lost in thought that I don't realize the door to the bathroom is opening. The steam from the water covers the shower door hiding whoever it is that's entered unannounced.
My heart starts beating when I think the worst is going to happen.
“Who's there?” I try to sound confident but my voice trembles instead.
“Relax, it's just me.”
I relax the moment I hear Ryder's soothing voice. 'I did knock, but I didn't hear your answer. So, I thought I'd check on you just to make sure you're doing okay.”
I sigh and try to cover myself from Ryder even though he can't see me. “I'm sorry, I was just thinking about Terry, and how people are going to react when they start realizing that he and Mr. Daniels are gone.”
Ryder stands in front of the shower door where I can see his silhouette. “We will find whoever's killing these people. They'll make a mistake, they'll get caught and we'll be there when they do.”
Why do I not feel reassured?
I turn off the water and sit myself down on the tile floor. “I just can't believe he's gone. I mean, what am I supposed to do when I show up at the diner tomorrow? Do I act like nothing's happened or what?”
“Going to the diner tomorrow if this gets out might not be a great idea. The killer might be there looking for its next victim, and for some reason they targeted Terry. All I can think about is what if it results in you getting hurt.”
“Why would I get hurt? I've done nothing wrong. They've already hurt me by killing two people that I considered friends.”
Ryder sighs. “Just stay away from the diner at least until the questions stop.”
“And how long will that be?”
Ryder shrugs. “I don't know, but from now on we're gonna watch ourselves because for all we know, the person who took those photos of you could be the same person killing these people.”
I sigh. “Ryder they have photos of me shifting. I'm so sorry to put you in this position.”
Ryder says nothing other than opens the shower door.
I bring my knees closer to my chest. He's seen me in this state more than once, I can't bring myself to ask him to leave after all he's done for me.
Ryder comes to sit next to me with his legs stretched in front of him. “Don't ever apologise when it's not your fault.”
I look at him. “But it is my fault, I should've been more careful, or at least hid somewhere in the forest and out of sight.”
Ryder shakes his head. “It's their fault for trespassing on private property. Stop blaming yourself, Alice. They shouldn't have been there in the first place.” A moment of silence passes.
“Ryder, I have to tell you something.” “What is it?”
“It's about Max.”
Ryder tenses his jaw and nods.
I clear my throat. “When Max came to school on his first day, we talked about stuff, and he told me something about his mum that I found out was a lie.”
He indicates me to go on.
“He told me that his mum works at the hospital, and last night I asked my mum if she works with someone with the surname Fields, but the thing is, she told me that she's never come across that name before. My mother's worked there for over twenty years. Why would he lie about something like that?”
Ryder shows no expression other than a slight frown on his face. “I don't know.”
“Look, I think you're right about staying away from him because ever since he came to Small Town, it's like everything's fallen apart or something's gone wrong. The lies and that mysterious recovery he had after being in a fight. I'm pretty sure after last night's fight he's probably recovered by now.”
“I swear Alice, the fight you saw last night was the only one I was responsible for.”
I look closely at Ryder and for some reason, I feel that he's telling the truth. “Okay, I believe you.”
Ryder nods and picks himself off the floor getting ready to leave. “I went to look for some clothes for you, but I could only find these.”
“Thank you.”
Ryder looks at my position on the floor and clears his throat. “If this whole Max situation bothers you, we could always ask him, you know.”
I scoff. “I hope you don't mean beating him up again.”
“Alice, I only did that because he lied about the first beating. I don't mess around when it comes to being blamed for something I didn't do.”
I say nothing.
“If you want we'll go and you can ask him whatever it is you want to know. It's better to know than to not know. That's all I'm saying.”
I think for a moment whether confronting Max is a good idea but after today I need answers more than anything.
“I'll go tomorrow, you can come with me if you want.” Ryder grins. “I'd love to.”
Chapter 18

Ryder left me alone shortly after he agreed that he would come with me to Max's place tomorrow. For all we know, Max could be innocent in all of this, but with last night still playing on my mind with what my mother told me, the only way I'll feel reassured is if I ask Max about it personally.
I get up from the floor and decide to get dressed and pick the closest towel to dry myself quickly. The clothes Ryder brought for me rest in a pile on top of the bathroom counter. I rummage through the clothes one by one only to notice a lot of indecent clothes I would never wear, I guess they're owned by Silver.
Underneath all the skimpy clothes, I find a plain white t- shirt, put it on hastily and I notice some grey sweatpants lying by the shower that's obviously Ryder's.
A part of me feels that it would be somewhat inappropriate to wear them, but find that I don't have any other choice but to wear the sweats instead.
I smile to myself at the comfort the sweats provide, then leave the bathroom and make my way to the kitchen but stop when I hear two familiar voices and one unrecognizable. I quietly and carefully lean over to look at who the voice belongs to only to see a man standing next to Kellan in a police uniform with salt and pepper hair and very tired eyes. He looks at Ryder soberly who stands in front of him, who has worn a t-shirt by now with his arms crossed over his chest in a relaxed posture.
“Ryder, you know I consider you like a son, but I have to ask you these questions because it's mandatory.”
Ryder shakes his head. “I didn't kill him, Tom. Do you really think I'd do something like that?”
“Of course not but as of right now, you are a suspect considering where the body was found.”
Kellan looks at the officer. “None of us did it dad, but I'm telling you someone placed him there intentionally to make it look like Ryder did it.”
Tom nods. “I'm not pointing any fingers at anyone, but I'm going to have to ask you these questions. I'm just doing my job so just cooperate with me, okay?”
Ryder scoffs. “'Fine.”
The police officer takes out a pad, a pen then clears his throat. “Where were you between 10:00 am and 12:00 pm today?”
Ryder doesn't hesitate. “I went out for a run.” “Be more specific, where did you run?”
Ryder sighs and points behind Tom to where the clearing of the forest all of us ran through. “Through that clearing there and ran into the forest.”
Tom writes down Ryder's statement. “Were you with anyone or were you by yourself?”
“We went our separate ways for the run today, but none of us was in the area when the murder took place.”
Tom nods again. “Can anyone vouch for that?”
Ryder asks sharply. “What? Why are you asking me that Tom? Are you actually trying to pin this on me?”
Tom lowers the pad and looks directly at Ryder. “It's protocol. If someone can vouch for you then I can cross you out as a suspect.”
“Why does it matter if I was with someone or not?” “Well, was there anyone?” Tom asks impatiently. “Yes, she was.” My attention is drawn to where Kellan now looks towards my direction with his finger pointing at me.
Heads swing in my direction, including the officer. Ryder takes in my appearance as though he approves of the fact that I was wearing his clothes. The officer, on the other hand, looks at me with curiosity.
“Who are you?” Tom tilts his head as though he's trying to understand why I'm in this house, with these people. Why all of a sudden did I feel so unwelcome?
Kellan indicates to me. “This is Alice, she's...”
“My girlfriend.” Ryder finishes for Kellan. They both exchange glances.
I stand there quietly, not knowing what to say or do to Ryder's declaration, but I decide to go with it.
Tom frowns and indicates me to come forward. “And what's your name?”
I approach the officer, stand next to Ryder and smile softly. “I'm Alice Smith.”
Tom takes in my whole appearance, moves to look at Ryder then at his own son. “Are you aware of what happened here today, Alice?”
I nod. “I am aware, yes. Terry was a good person.”
Tom looks at me as though I have piqued his curiosity. “You knew the victim?” He writes on his notepad.
“Yes, we worked together at the diner.” I can feel myself getting emotional just by talking about him.
“And were you and the victim	close?”
Ryder snarls. “What are you suggesting? That she was romantically involved with a guy that's old enough to be her dad?”
Ryder's words cause me to wince to which he notices straight away and looks at me apologetically.
I shake my head. “Terry was someone that I considered a very close friend of mine. He always kept to himself and he loved working at the diner. It was like his second home.” I wipe away a tear.
Tom looks at me with sorrow. “Boys, I'd like to have a few words with Alice here alone.”
Why would Tom want to speak with me? He didn't think I was suspicious, did he?
Ryder looks like he's going to argue with the officer but soon composes himself when Tom reassures him that it's only to speak with me. “Ryder, I just want to speak with her. I'm not accusing her of anything.” Tom looks at Kellan. “I'll see you back at home, son.”
Kellan leaves the room taking Ryder with him.
As soon as the door of the house closes, Tom indicates for me to sit down at the table. “Would you like something to drink Alice?”
I smile gently and nod. “A glass of water, please.”
Silently, Tom takes out a glass, fills it with water and gives it to me. “Thank you.”
Tom moves to sit in the chair opposite me and clears his throat. “Alice, I know this must be hard for you and I'm sorry for your loss.”
I sit quietly listening to what Kellan's father has to say but there's nothing right now anyone could say to make me feel better. Hearing that Mr Daniels had died was a complete surprise and I still can't believe that's really happened, but after finding Terry's dead body, I can finally believe that Mr Daniels is dead too.
“I don't really know where I go from here.”
Tom sighs. “Losing someone that was close to you will hurt, and it will take a sufficient amount of time for the heart to heal, but I can tell just by looking at you that you're a strong independent young woman.”
I shake my head. “That's not true officer because if I was a strong woman, I'd be out there trying to look for the killer, but instead I'm trying to decide what to do next.”
Tom frowns. “You've lost someone you cared about deeply, and that feeling doesn't just wash away after a few hours. It could take days, months or even a few years to get over something that you've lost.”
I wipe away another tear. “I can still see Terry's dead body inside my head. How long will it take to get those images out of my mind?”
Tom shakes his head. “That will take some time and it won't get any easier, Alice. Only time will truly tell you.”
A few minutes go by in uncomfortable silence.
“Were you there when Mr. Daniels' body was found?”
Tom nods. “I was there at the scene when I heard that Mr. Daniels was found in his home.”
“Do you think whatever killed him did the same to Terry?”
He shrugs. “I can't say for sure but the cause of death of both victims are very similar to each other.”
I'm not sure what I'm trying to accomplish here but for some reason, I can't stop asking Tom about what happened to Mr. Daniels that night.
“Mr. Daniels was found ripped to shreds, wasn't he?” I ask even though I already know the answer.
Tom looks away. “This isn't the right time to talk about such things.”
“But it's true, isn't it?” I wait patiently.
Would now be a good time to ask about Anna's death considering that she was found ripped to shreds too?
He slowly looks back at me and nods his head leisurely. “Suspicions are that whoever killed these victims were likely caused by an animal, but there's not enough evidence to show what truly killed them.”
I pick up the glass and take a sip of the water. “Maybe it isn't an animal attack, but I can't think of why someone would want to kill them unless they had a good reason to which I sincerely doubt it.”
Tom just shrugs. “Maybe there is a motive, but we somehow haven't found it yet.”
I slam down the glass on the table. “Well, then you need to find it before somebody else dies.”
His eyes widen at my response.
I take a deep breath. “The next victim could be anyone or do you not realize that officer? Why haven't you gone to the press and why keep the murders a secret from the town?” I'm bombarded with questions that I want to be answered, but something tells me that I won't get anything out of Kellan's father.
He looks down at the floor. “Myself and the officers are doing everything we can, and the reason behind why the police haven't gone to the reporters is because we want to make sure that we know exactly who's responsible, whether it be an animal or a human being. We don't want to scare the town.”
For some reason, I can understand why the police haven't gone to the reporters. Who knows what could happen when the whole town finds out that there's a murderer out there?
I stand from the chair preparing to leave when Tom suddenly stands too. “Before you leave, I'd like to ask you something.”' He looks perplexed at me. “Did you and Mr. Daniels get along at all?”
Is he being serious?
“First, you ask me if I was close to Terry and now you're asking me if I got along with my English teacher. What is it that you really want to know?”
He becomes serious. “I do have my reasons to ask you this question Alice because after listening to you talk about Terry, I can't help but be suspicious that maybe you're somehow involved in this case.”
What!?
“How can I possibly be involved in this case?”
Tom slicks his hair back in frustration. “I know how this must sound to you, but just help me out here.”
I can only stare at him and wonder where I fit in all of this. “If you must know officer, Mr. Daniels was a great teacher who loved his job and cared about a lot of people. He'd always make sure that if any student of his needed extra help or support that he'd always be there for them. So, to answer your question about if I got along with him then the answer would be of course I did. He was always there whenever I needed someone to talk to about my dad who left, and no matter what he'd always listen and he'd tell me that I didn't need a father because I was strong enough to look after myself and my mother. I hope that answers your question.” I leave Tom standing alone in the kitchen and rush out to the front of the house making my way towards the car.
I get to my car, pick the right key and open the door when I hear my name being called several times. I ignore the voice and start getting into the car when a hand grabs onto my arm pulling me away from the car. I turn and stare directly into Ryder's eyes.
“Where do you think you're going?”
I remove Ryder's hand from my arm and move back to the car. “Away from here where I won't be interrogated like a bad person.”
Ryder's voice deepens. “Did Tom say something to you?”
I scoff. “What do you think we've been talking about for the past half hour? The weather?”
Ryder just looks at me. “Did he give you a hard time in there?”
“A hard time? He thinks...” I shake my head dumbfounded. “He thinks I'm somehow involved in the case because I knew the victims.”
“What?” Ryder looks at me in confusion. “Why would he think that you're involved?”
I point to myself. “You're asking me? I don't even know where I fit into this.”
Ryder stands in front of me and cups my cheek gently. “Tom's under a lot of stress, and he probably wasn't thinking straight when he said that to you.”
I stare at him for a moment and consider his words. “Aren't we all under a lot of stress after what happened today?”
Ryder looks away from me. “We'll find whoever took those pictures of you and I'm telling you now, I won't stop until I find that person and make them suffer for what they've done.” He looks back at me. “But until then, you don't leave my side until I know that you're safe again.”
Well if that isn't a nice thing to say to someone then I don't know what is.
I clear my throat. “But what if we never catch whoever did it?”
Ryder smirks. “Then I suggest you pack your bags and have yourself prepared to stay with me forever.” He chuckles as he walks away.
That doesn't sound fun. At all. “You're not actually serious are you?”
Ryder faces me with his hands in his pockets. “I don't joke around when it comes to your safety, Alice.”
“But my mother...?”
“Call your mum and tell her that you'll be staying with Sam for a couple of days. I'm sure she won't mind.” Ryder walks back into the house without a backward glance.
Would staying here with Ryder, Silver, Bane and Kellan be a good idea? For some reason, I do feel somewhat protected whenever I'm with them, but I also feel terrible for leaving my mother alone in that big house. She's hardly ever at home and I know she spends most of the time at the hospital, but I don't want to make her feel as though I'm leaving her just like my father did. Someone out there knows the truth about me, and I know that what I'm about to do might be the wrong decision to make, but something tells me that this is the right decision.
I walk into the wolves' house, dial my mother's number and wait patiently for her to answer.
Chapter 19

The rest of the night passed by in a blur. I kept to myself spending most of the night in one of the spare bedrooms thinking about how tomorrow would go. I recall about the last time I spoke with Max and how we left things that night when he kissed me. It was only for a second but it felt so much longer. The feeling that I'll have to face him tomorrow makes me uneasy and I wish I knew what will happen when we finally confront Max about his lies.
The moment the call ended with my mother, I went in search for Ryder and asked him if there was a place I could rest for the night. He showed me to a substantial room that I'd be staying in for the next few nights and assured me that if I needed anything to just ask him. He told me that dinner would be at six o'clock to which I informed him that I would stay in the room for the rest of the night. The moment he left the room I glanced around at the bedroom and took in the beautiful decor.
The purple painted walls decorated with various sizes of flowers with a four poster bed placed opposite the large window overlooking the forest. Two bedside tables placed neatly at both sides of the bed with a chaise lounge resting at the end of the bed that has neatly piled clothes resting on top of it. I walk to the left side of the room and notice a bookshelf holding various novels that are obviously suited for a young teenaged girl.
Whoever owns this room sure likes to read about vampires and romance.
Who could this room possibly belong to?
I chuckle to myself and look at the clock hanging on the right side of the room to see that it's 5:30 pm. I wonder if the wolves are preparing themselves dinner or if they're already eating. I'm actually surprised that after today they have an appetite.
To think about it, today wasn't how I imagined things would go and it's all been very draining. The world lost a good person today, and it will be hard for me to accept that he's gone. Work will be different from now on and what makes things worse is that Robbie probably won't even know where his most reliable worker has gone.
The fact that myself and a few other people know exactly what happened to Terry makes me feel guilty. I wish I could tell people the truth about what's going on in this town.
I walk to the pile of clothes on the chaise lounge where I find a pair of men's black boxers and a plain white vest. I wear what I assume are Ryder's clothes, climb onto the bed and wrap myself in the black and silver bedspread.
Then, I decide to go to bed early in preparation for the dreaded day that awaits for me tomorrow.
Chapter 20

At exactly 8:00 am I was up and ready to go. By 8:30 I'd had a shower, brushed my teeth and changed into a pair of jeans and an oversized hoodie that was left for me just as I got out of the shower.
The moment I open the bedroom door, the smell of bacon fills my senses; making my stomach growl in yearning that reminds me at that moment that I hadn't had anything to eat the day before.
I enter the kitchen where I see different flavours of juice, a fresh fruit salad, fresh toast and various flavours of cereal neatly placed on the kitchen table. My stomach growls again as I take in the untouched food that has been prepared for me.
“Morning.” I jerk as I hear Bane's gruff like voice that stirs my attention from the kitchen table to where I see him pouring an orange juice.
Was he talking to me?
I look behind me to see if he's actually speaking to me and point to myself. “Are you talking to me?”
“Who else would I be talking to? The wall?” Bane turns his back on me to keep an eye on the bacon.
I don't know why but with Bane talking like this kind of freaks me out considering he always acts like an asshole.
“I don't know. It's just that you always look at me like I'm a piece of shit, so it's really weird that you're talking like a normal human being.” I pull out a chair and sit at the table.
He snorts. “I look at everyone like that so why should I treat you any different?”
I stare at his back with imaginable lasers - wishing it was the real thing. “Whatever.”
I pour myself some apple juice and butter a piece of toast when I hear someone coming down the stairs. The footfalls are too heavy to be Silver's and Kellan's probably at home with his dad, so when Ryder comes into view it's really hard for me to take my eyes away from him.
Oh, Lord.
He comes into the kitchen while running his hand through his freshly showered hair, wearing a tight white wife- beater that showcases his perfectly sculpted body, black jeans with his feet bare. He smiles, sits directly in front of me and pours some cranberry juice for himself. Neither of us breaks the staring contest we seem to have, but it breaks just as Silver comes barging into the kitchen over to where Bane stands.
“I'll have some of that bacon, Bane.” Silver inhales the bacon one last time before taking the seat next to Ryder.
Bane scowls from behind her. “You thought this was for you?” Bane scoffs as he holds up the bacon sandwich that immediately causes my mouth to water. “I ain't no one's bitch Silver, especially not yours.” He takes a bite of the sandwich, and walks out of the kitchen followed by a now annoyed Silver.
Ryder shakes his head. “I swear those two will be the death of me.”
“Are they that bad?” I take another sip of the apple juice.
Ryder takes the bowl of the fresh salad and dishes himself a bowl. “When they came into my pack they absolutely hated each other. Couldn't stand to be in the same room without one or the other starting a fight.”
“Why did they hate each other so much?”
He shrugs. “I can't say for sure but I think it had something to do with both of them being my Betas. You see, Silver thought that because we were sleeping together that she was entitled to being my second in command, but considering that Bane's saved my life more than once, he's gained that right for himself and he'll never give that up. I know that he comes off as rude and hot headed, but he's loyal and he's good at what he does.”
That I can believe.
“How did you make them stop fighting?”
“It was simple, I told Silver to get over it or she'll be kicked out from the pack.”
“Wow, I bet she took that well.” I say enthusiastically. After that, we finish eating our breakfast in comfortable silence. We don't talk about what might happen today or if something could go wrong, but I can only imagine the worst when it involves Max and Ryder.
After clearing the dirty dishes, I go up the stairs, into the bedroom and change into the sweats and t-shirt I wore yesterday. I don't think twice about how I look when I leave the house, and I find Ryder in a black sports car waiting for me. The moment I close the door and put my seatbelt on, we're on our way towards Max's house.
We arrive outside his house forty minutes later and throughout the whole journey, I kept asking myself if Ryder actually knew where Max lived. I know he's a wolf and all but can a wolf actually lead you to someone's house?
What am I talking about of course wolves can!
I take in the small bungalow in front of me and to be truthful I didn't expect Max to live in such a small and unkempt place. I'm not sure what I expected, but this is definitely not what I pictured.
I get out of the car with Ryder close behind and make my way towards the door. I look behind me and look at Ryder without any reason to. Maybe I'm looking at him for an answer on if we should do this or not, but when he nods at me to go on, I know I have my answer.
After knocking the first couple of times, there wasn't any sign of Max, I even called and texted him a few times to ask where he was but received no answer. When I start thinking about giving up, Ryder surprises me by moving me out of the way and kicking the front door.
“What the hell do you think you're doing? You can't just kick down someone's door!” I look around to see if anyone saw.
He kicks the door again making the door slam against the wall and break off its hinges, caused by his strength. “How else are we going to get in?”
I stand in the doorway debating whether to go into the house or not. “We could've just waited for Max to get here!”
“Nah, that doesn't work for me.”
I roll my eyes. “Nothing ever works for you, does it?”
His head swings to my direction. “What the hell does that even mean?”
“Nothing. Just forget it.” I go into the house and look around. We stand across from each other in the living area in complete silence.
“So, what? We just wait for him to get here?” I take a seat on the brown leather couch while Ryder stands in the middle of the room. “That's the plan.”
“And we're just gonna talk to him.” Ryder says nothing.
“Right, Ryder? You've got to remember that he's not an Alpha like you, so no fighting, okay?”
Ryder grits out. “Whatever you say.”
We waited a full hour and when we thought he'd be a no show, we were both startled by the sound of the back door slamming.
We remain quiet from our positions, waiting for Max to appear. There's no surprise when he shows less than a minute later without any sign of an injury from the fight with Ryder.
He stares at the broken down door in confusion. “What the fuck man?” Max looks at Ryder with a disapproving frown.
Something tells me that it wasn't a good idea to come here after all.
Ryder sighs and looks at him with a bored expression, “Sit down. We need to talk.”
“About what? What could be that bad of a reason to kick my door down?”
I stand from the couch. “I tried to call and text but you wouldn't answer.”
Max scoffs. “And you've done this because I didn't answer the phone?” He indicates the mess Ryder's done.
“Please Max, we just want to talk.”
Max shakes his head. “I don't need to do anything, Alice. I'd appreciate it if you both left.”
“It'll only take a couple of minutes.” I take a step towards him.
He tenses his jaw. “I said no, I won't ask you again.”
Ryder moves to stand in front of me with his arms crossed over his chest. “You are going to talk because we came here for a reason, and we're not gonna leave until you give us what we need.”
Max rolls his eyes. “And what is it that you need from me?”
“Answers.” I take another step towards him.
“What answers could you possibly want from me?” He glares intensely at both of us.
“Well first, how about you tell us asshole	”
I stop Ryder. “Ryder, please.” I give him a look to indicate that I'll do the talking. I can't risk him pissing off Max before we get any answers.
I clear my throat and begin my interrogation. “Do you remember that day, out by the football field when I saw you on crutches?”
“Of course I remember. It's kinda hard to forget being in a fight that happened on my first day of school.” He stares at Ryder.
