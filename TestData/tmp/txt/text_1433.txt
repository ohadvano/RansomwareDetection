“You may not have been bitten by either one of us, but the wolf that bit you seems to have not claimed you as being part of its pack. Perhaps if you joined a pack, your Alpha might find you and claim you back. Now, I'll consider having you being a part of my pack but I'm guessing that's gonna be a problem seeing as two of my Betas can't stand you.”
“Wait, who said anything about being in your pack? Or any pack for that matter?”
“Alice, you're gonna need a pack. An Omega rarely survives on its own. You could get killed.”
“Why would I wanna be in a pack that doesn't even want me? I'd rather stay on my own and live my life like a normal person.”
Why can't things go back to the way they were? “What's an Omega?” Asks Sam.
Kellan clears his throat and pulls the blanket around him tighter. “You have three rankings of a wolf. Alpha, Beta and Omega. Alpha's are considered to be the most powerful, strongest and lethal.” He points at Ryder. “Ryder's the Alpha as we all know.”
Kellan points at Bane. “Bane and Silver are the Beta's of the pack. Betas are the second in command. When the Alpha dies one of the Betas take over. Then you have the Omega. the Lone wolf to be exact. Omegas are considered to being weaker than the Beta's. Wolves can become Omegas by choice or sometimes they can be forced to leave the pack.”
Kellan places his hands gently on my shoulders, “Alice, I advise you to think about Ryder's offer. You won't survive on your own.”
I take his hands away from me. “I can take care of myself.”
