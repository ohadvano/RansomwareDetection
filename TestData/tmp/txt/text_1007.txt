There has to be another way surely?
I'd take lessons with Bane first before learning anything from Ryder after what I saw tonight. Max's face will again be on my mind for a while, and until I find out all the answers that are left unresolved, I'm left feeling incomplete - I can't think of anything as to why Ryder did what he did.
I lie wide awake in my bed when I hear the door to my house closing downstairs. I lie awake most nights just to hear my mum coming through that door at ridiculous hours, and yet she still returns to the hospital. She loves doing what she does best - the things she can do mesmerizes me.
I turn to my side; away from the door and shut my eyes ready for sleep to overtake me.
When I hear the door to my bedroom open gently, I smile happily to myself. Not once has my mother forgotten to check on me straight when she comes home. In a way, I think she does it to reassure herself that I'm still here with her.
She never says anything to me, she has a quick look to see if I'm asleep and then leaves quietly, and she never closes the door. So when I hear the door start closing and footsteps approaching my bed, I know something isn't right. I swiftly turn the lamp on placed on my bedside table and turn to face whoever's entered my room.
It doesn't matter how many times I see him, he'll always make me feel nervous, but for some reason seeing him here right now, makes me forget about the argument we had earlier.
Ryder stands unmoving in the middle of my room - his clothes soaked from the wet weather outside. He wears black skinny jeans with a white shirt sticking to him that makes out his bare muscular chest underneath. His hair is slicked back with droplets of rain falling every so often on his face, and he also breathes heavily like he's been running to get here.
I'm frozen from the position in my bed wondering what has brought Ryder here in the middle of the night.
