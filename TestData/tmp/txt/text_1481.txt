I turn to leave but not before someone grabs a hold of my arm.
I roll my eyes when I see it's Ryder.
“You've had your chance to speak, now it's my turn to talk.”
He leans into me and brushes his lips over my ear. My whole body shivers as he whispers to me. “Don't ever slap me again otherwise I'll have to do something about it.
Now, for beating up your precious friend, if I remember correctly, Kellan and I were at the diner right after you left yesterday. And for Bane?” Ryder shrugs. “He doesn't give a shit about anybody but seeing as he doesn't know what the hell you're talking about, then I guess you're at a loss here.”
He turns away from me with Bane on his heels.
Kellan remains looking at the ground. “You really think we'd do something like that?”
“Kellan, I don't know what to believe right now, but if you saw the state Max is in then you wouldn't know what to think.”
“Alice, we don't just go around beating people.”
