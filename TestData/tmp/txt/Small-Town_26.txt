When I come downstairs, I see that Sam's mother has prepared us both breakfast.
“Morning Alice, did you sleep well?”
She grabs the steaming kettle and pours the hot water into three mugs.
I smile as I make my way to the table. “Morning Sally. I actually slept better than I thought I would.”
I cross my arms on the table and look out towards the window.
“Sam should be down in a minute. She's probably trying to decide what to wear to school.”
Sally brings a mug of tea over and places it in front of me.
I thank her and place my hands around the hot mug to keep my hands nice and warm.
Sally also brings over a plate with butter covered toast to the table and sits down next to me. “How's things at home? Your mom doing okay?” She grabs a little plate from the middle of the table and takes a piece of toast.
Things at home have been kinda strange since recent events. Before being bitten, I never once had a boy over at my house, let alone having four shapeshifters in my living room.
I take a sip from the mug and look at my best friend's mother. “Everything's fine and mom's always working at the hospital so I barely get to see her.”
Sally smiles warmly. “Your mother's always been a workaholic. I remember when your mother and I went to school together. She always carried a box of tissues with her at all times just in case someone got a nosebleed.”
I snicker. “Sounds like my mother.” I grab a piece of toast and take a bite.
“Everything alright at school? Sam mentioned that you've got a new English teacher?” Sally looks behind her at the clock and shakes her head.
I nod my head.
Do I mention what happened to Mr. Daniels to her or not?
“Yeah, Mr. Edmund has taken over the class.” I clear my throat. “And school? The same as always, I guess.”
Sally raises her brow. “Meaning?”
“Meaning...” Before I have a chance to answer I get interrupted.
“Meaning it's an absolutely pointless ritual that's full of hormonal teenage boys who drool at even a slight peak of cleavage.”
I'm looking at my best friend with my mouth hanging wide open; stunned into silence. When I think that her mother is going to yell at her daughter for being crude, Sally surprises me when she bursts out laughing. “The words that come out of your mouth, Sam.” She stands from the table and empties the contents into the sink. “You're definitely my daughter.”
Sam scoffs. “And here I thought I was adopted.”
Sam takes an apple from the fruit bowl that sits on the end of the table.
“Oh honey, sorry to disappoint you.”
Sally kisses the top of Sam's head and winks at me. “You girls have a good day at school.”
She waves and leaves the room.
When the house door closes I smirk towards Sam. “You wish you were adopted?”
“You would be too if you heard what goes on in this house.” Sam looks in the microwave and looks at herself through the reflection. “They're at it all the time.”
I may have thrown up a little in my mouth hearing about Sam's parents' love life. I guess with how close we are as best friends it's nice to know that she feels comfortable sharing things with me, but sharing things about her parents might just be a little bit too personal. “That's a little too much information, Sam.”
Sam turns around. “I bet sex with Ryder was on your mind last night.”
I groan. “Can you please not bring last night up again. I feel weird that you had to witness that.”
“Please.” Sam scoffs. “Last night was nothing compared to what I've done. My parents have caught me doing way worse things.”
I get up from the table, grab my shoes and bag from where I left them yesterday under the stairs.
“My dad chased a guy once right down the drive with a baseball bat in his hands. He never visited again.”
Sam grabs her keys and opens the front door.
“I don't blame the poor guy. No one would wanna mess with your dad.”
“That's what dads are for. Chasing away every guy on the planet who wants to date their daughter, I mean what would your dad.	” I turn to see her clenching her eyes
tightly. “Shit	I shouldn't have brought him up. I'm so sorry, Alice.”
In the past when people would ask a simple question like, 'what do your parents do?' I always responded with a lie. For eighteen years, I've learnt to accept the fact that he isn't coming back to me and my mother. Besides, after all these years I don't think she'd want anything to do with him. I remember the days when she'd lock herself in her room and never come out, I'd sit outside her bedroom door for hours just to make sure that she was still breathing.
Being that young and oblivious, I didn't know what was happening, there was nothing I could do to make her happy. I see it sometimes on her face when she isn't looking, the faraway look she has in her eyes, and it makes me wonder if she actually misses him. It was hard seeing my mother lost like that, I never want to see my mother in that state ever again.
I shrug. “There's nothing to be sorry for. It's not your fault my dad just up and left.”
She sighs. “I know that we don't talk about it. It's just, why?” Sam shakes her head. “Do you ever wonder why he left?”
“Yeah, but after all these years I've stopped asking myself why because I'm not gonna find the answer. He's gone and I'd rather he didn't come back.”
“And if he did?”
I clench my jaw. “I'd make him wish that he made a big mistake coming back here.”
When me and Sam arrive at school, we both part ways to our lessons; Sam making her way towards Math while I make my way towards Biology. I quietly walk to my desk at the front but realize that Max hasn't arrived yet.
Maybe he's running late?
He's probably missed the bus or something. I'd understand if he didn't come after what happened to him yesterday. I can't help but picture Max's beaten face, and it makes me want to check up on him to see if he's okay.
As Mr. Thompson enters the classroom, he places his brown leather briefcase on his desk, and claps his hands to gather the attention of his students.
“Good morning everyone. For today's session, I'd like everybody to do some individual revision for the test next week. Any questions, just ask me.” Mr Thompson looks around the classroom, nods to himself then turns to sit behind his desk and starts up his laptop.
Through the hour of Biology, I couldn't concentrate looking over my notes I'd written on the variations of genetics and gave up halfway through the lesson to watch the clock ticking instead.
I sigh in contempt when I hear the bell that signals the end of lesson, I couldn't stand to sit at my desk any longer. I gather my notes and walk out of the classroom to head to my next class. English.
As I round the corner I see Sam huddled over her phone with a huge grin on her face.
“Did Bane finally send you a friend request on Facebook?” I nudge Sam as I stand next to her waiting for Mr. Edmund to arrive.
She pouts. “Still waiting for that too, but I've found something better.”
I arch my brows. “What did you find?”
Sam lowers her phone and looks at me. “Do you want to go to a house party tonight?”
Those were not the words I expected her to say. “Is someone we know throwing a party?”
I don't really know that many people in this school, so it's most likely one of Sam's friends.
“Kind of.” She bites her lip. “Oh God, whose party is it?”
Sam clears her throat and mumbles as she looks away from me.
“Sam!?”
“Don't get pissed off with me!” “Whose party is it!?”
“Alright! It's at Ryder's house! I really really want to go! Please come with me Alice!”
Sam is practically begging me and she's causing a scene in front of our class.
Just as I'm about to respond to her, Mr. Edmund rounds the corner in his navy pea coat and black slacks. For a teacher he actually dresses quite smart.
He unlocks the classroom door and ushers everyone in. He waits in front of the classroom and stands opposite my desk with a smirk on his face. I take my seat when
suddenly the whole classroom goes silent, I understand why when I look up to see Ryder and his crew enter the room.
Mr. Edmund watches them very closely as they sit in their seats.
“Was I not clear yesterday?” Mr. Edmund's voice gathers everyone's attention.
The class remains silent.
I think about what Mr. Edmund's referring to and think about what happened in yesterday's lesson. The only events I can remember yesterday was the change, the fight with Ryder and Max's injuries.
Mr. Edmund looks at me with disappointment.
“Can someone remind me what I said yesterday before I had to leave to deal with an important matter?”
I peak a glance at Ryder to see him lounging in his seat watching Mr. Edmunds' every move. He looks worn out but my attention is drawn back to the front when I hear my name being called out.
“Yes, sir?”
He crosses his arms against his chest and moves to stand right in front of my desk. “What did I tell everyone not to do before I left this classroom?”
I don't know! I can't remember!
I clear my throat and shake my head. “I don't know.”
He tilts his head and frowns. “You don't know?” “No, sir.”
Minutes go by and no one says a word.
Then out of nowhere, Mr. Edmund slams his fist down on my desk that creates a loud deafening sound echo throughout the whole class.
He stares at me a little longer, shakes his head then goes to stand directly in front of Ryder's desk.
“Mr. King, do you remember what I said yesterday?” Mr. Edmund places his hands on his hips, showing no sign of the fact that he's hurt himself.
Ryder remains silent.
“Surely you can remember? No?”
I look towards Ryder to see him scowling at the teacher. “I'm not fond of the silent treatment, Ryder.”
Mr. Edmund leans right into Ryder's face. “I mean, is it really that hard to remember what I said? I'll take that as a yes! Are you deaf? Incompetent or just lazy?”
Again, Ryder says nothing.
“You disappoint me Ryder, just like Alice here.”
Mr. Edmund waits a little longer at Ryder's desk then strides towards Bane's desk.
“And what about you Bane? Will you be the one to tell me what I said yesterday?”
Bane looks at him with distaste. “Nope.”
Mr. Edmund chuckles and walks to the classroom door. “Seeing as this lesson has not gone to plan, class is dismissed.”
Students begin to gather their things and rush to leave the classroom. I look at Sam in confusion to see her smiling as she gets up from her seat and leaves the room. She's probably waiting for me outside the class so that she can beg me to go to the party with her tonight.
Just as I get up from my chair, Mr. Edmund closes the door so all that's left in the classroom is me, and the four wolves.
“You three can keep me company at detention starting from 2:30 in here.” He then looks at Kellan and Silver. “You two clearly know how to listen better than these three.”
He smirks as he opens the door. “Hopefully this time you won't forget, otherwise there will be serious consequences.”
I couldn't eat during lunch break. The thought of eating anything made me feel nauseas. Sam kept begging me and begging me to go tonight and after continuously saying no to her, she just wouldn't give up. I gave up after the hundredth time and told her that I would go, but only for a little while. To say that she was happy was an understatement. She screamed so loud in the cafeteria, everyone was staring at her.
After lunch, Sam told me that she'd be leaving early in preparation for tonight because she wants to look perfect for Bane even though she looks pretty good in absolutely anything.
At 2:30, I arrive in our English class where detention is being held. I open the door to see Mr. Edmund already in his chair.
He indicates for me to enter and have a seat.
I take my usual seat in the front and wait for further instructions.
After last night, I thought a part of me would feel different, like I'd be able to hear and smell things that no ordinary person could do, but nothing.
The door opens and in walks Ryder followed by Bane.
Ryder pulls the chair out placed next to me while Bane sits on his own at another desk.
Mr. Edmund stands from his chair and stares at each of us individually. “Yesterday, you three decided to disobey my orders by leaving this very classroom. Therefore you will stay here until the end of the day. I will allow you to speak, but you will not, I repeat not be allowed to move from this room. Do I make myself clear?”
Neither Bane nor Ryder say a word. I quietly murmur. “Yes, sir.”
As Mr. Edmund sits, I take out my notes for Biology and pretend to look over them to make myself look busy.
Ryder lounges in his chair with one leg propped on the other while Bane puts his head on the desk.
“You okay?”
I swivel my head towards Ryder. “I'm fine.” A moment of silence. I turn back to my notes. “Are you sure?”
“Mhm.”
Another moment of silence.
“Are you just gonna sit there and ignore me?”
“I'm not ignoring you. I'm just revising for my test.” He scoffs. “Sure, I know what you're doing.”
“And what exactly is that.” My focus remains on the paper.
“Don't pretend that last night never happened because it did.”
I face him, my voice rising a little. “Nothing happened so just forget about it!”
Mr. Edmund's head rises from the papers in front of him. “Shush!”
“Keep telling yourself that Alice because we both know you wanted me.”
“It was a mistake!” I hiss.
Ryder looks angrily at me, shoves himself out of the chair and throws his chair to the back of the class.
Mr. Edmund remains seated in his chair with a look of boredom on his face.
“Get the chair and sit down Mr. King.” “Nah, screw this.”
He calls Bane and they both leave the classroom.
I sit in shock just as Mr. Edmund casually walks to the front of my desk.
“Let today be the first warning Alice, because disobedience is not tolerated in my classroom. Ever. Those two will definitely not be returning to this class after their behaviour this evening. One thing I will tell is that I would carefully advise you to think about who you surround yourself with.” He turns back to his desk. “You are dismissed, Alice.”
I quickly gather my things and rush out of the classroom.
At the end of the day, I decide to surprise my mother at the hospital with an early supper. My mother adores Chinese food but working night shifts she barely has the chance to eat any. I stop by at the reception to give them my name and my reason for being there, when I see a recognisable face reading a magazine.
“Max?”
He pauses for a minute then decides to look up at me. I'm taken aback when I don't see any bruises on his face or any sign of the crutches he had with him yesterday.
“Oh...hey Alice.”
He remains seated in the chair.
“You look much better than you did yesterday.”
There are no words I can manage to formulate. Max was beaten to a pulp yesterday and he looks very much unscathed.
“Yeah, my mom has healing powers.” He nervously chuckles.
I look down at his leg to see no cast either. “And your leg?”
He shrugs. “My mom can fix anything. I told you yesterday that it was nothing to worry about. Look at me, I'm fine.”
I frown, trying to come up with a reasonable explanation on how he's gone from looking like a beaten up rag doll, to looking completely fine, but I come up empty handed.
“So what brings you here?”
I show him the Chinese that I've brought to my mother. “I've brought my mum dinner. What brings you here?”
“I'm giving a ride home to my mother.”
I nod in understanding when I hear my mother calling my name. “Alice! What a surprise!”
I hug my mother tightly. “Yeah, I brought you your favourite Chinese, seeing as you never have the chance to eat on the weekends.”
My mother smiles. “Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.”
“When do you get off work?” “Late, sweetie.”
As always.
She takes the bag from me and kisses my forehead. “Do you have plans with Sam tonight?”
“There's a party tonight and I told her I'd go but...”
“No buts! You're going! It's the weekend and you deserve to have some fun, alright?” She hugs me again and leaves.
“There's a party tonight?” Max asks from behind me.
“Yeah, but it's at Ryder's house.” I face Max as he stands from his chair.
“Do you think I could come with you?”
“For someone that was beaten up by them, you don't seem that bothered.”
He shrugs. “What's the harm in attending their party, right?”
“Are you sure you wanna go?”
“Yeah! Why not? It's not like anything is going to happen!”
And so we both leave.
Chapter 13

The first thing I do when I leave the hospital is text Sam for the address of the party. The sensible side of me would be to not text her and go home where I can sit down with a good book or catch up with homework. After this week, I feel that going tonight to the party and having a few drinks couldn't hurt anybody because for once in my life, I can let my hair down and enjoy myself.
I won't have to worry about changing unexpectedly, I've proven all that I needed to prove, so for that I won't let anything stop me from having somewhat of a good time.
“So whereabouts is this party?” Max asks as he takes out his car keys and twirls them around his fingers.
“I don't know, but I've texted Sam to ask where it is because she's probably there right now dancing on the tables or something.”
He chuckles. “Is that something she does at every party?”
I shiver against the gust of wind that passes by which makes me rub both of my hands together. “She likes to have fun which is the complete opposite of me.” I sigh and shake my head in despair. “I don't even know why I'm going to this party. I mean I hate social activities.”
Max takes off his leather jacket and places it around my shoulders. “Here, this will keep you nice and warm.”
He presses the button to unlock his black Range Rover, stands on the passenger side, places his hand on the door and looks at me. “You're going tonight because you wanna look out for your friend, and that makes you a good person. Maybe you know deep down that she needs someone to look after her.”
I consider his words and slowly nod.
He opens the door of the car and waits for me to sit so that he can close it behind me. In that moment I get a text from Sam with the address. I show it to Max as soon as he closes his door.
The first thing I notice when we arrive closer to our destination are the cars lined up along the pavement and the people scattered everywhere along the property. I see people dancing, drinking and even some already passed out.
I get out from the car and walk alongside Max towards the house, the music playing so loud I can recognize the song from inside.
The house is hidden like the trees are purposely hiding it from view. I can't imagine what Ryder's house must look like.
I look around to see nothing but trees and it instantly makes me wonder what lurks beyond these woods.
Max and I follow a path that leads further into the woods, I place my hands in his jacket to keep warm when suddenly I inhale the intoxicating aroma of musk and pine needles overrunning the fresh air.
I walk a little farther, come to the clearing of the woods when I see the flickering flames of a campfire. I look at each person individually but see no recognizable faces.
We pass the campfire without a backward glance and slowly reach the house.
Wow...
The only word that comes to my mind when I look at this house is utterly breath-taking. The house is surrounded by glass and from the exact spot to where I'm standing, I can see everything. From here I see people dancing together, playing beer pong and some even doing body shots.
Hopefully Sam wasn't embarrassing herself in there.
I decide to go inside before changing my mind and take the stairs two at a time. Max can choose whether to follow or stick around outside but I have someone that I need to find. I push through the bodies that are in my way, to which I receive dirty looks and murmurs that are too quiet for me to understand. I finally get myself into the living room where I see a lot of people kissing and some doing things that I wish they could take outside.
People dance in the middle of the room but Sam is nowhere to be seen. I look behind me to see Max pushing his way through with the look of annoyance on his face, I call out his name but it's drowned out by the sound of music.
Having looked around the living area more than once, I decide to look for Sam in the kitchen, and the first thing I see is a stunning girl propped up on the steel counter wearing a tight silver dress covered in sparkles. The minute Silver's eyes meet mine she rolls her eyes.
“If you're trying to get Ryder's attention, he won't spare you a glance dressed like that.”
She takes in my black skinny jeans, the band t-shirt and leather jacket.
I ignore her and get right to the point. “Have you seen Sam anywhere?”
“Why would I care about where your annoying little friend is?”
She picks up the solo cup next to her and drains the whole thing.
“Because I'm trying to look for her, and I'd really appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction?”
Silver gets down from the counter and sways seductively to stand in front of me. “Sure I'll point you in the right direction. Go find Sam yourself, leave this house and stay away from what's mine, otherwise I'll kick your ass.”
I look at her in confusion. “What are you talking about?” “Stay away from Ryder.”
“I couldn't care less about him. All I want to do is find Sam because she came on her own, and I just wanna see if she's alright.”
“Look little wolf. You have no business here so take your blonde trash ass and get the hell off my property.”
“I'm not going anywhere until I find Sam.” She sighs, 'You never listen, do you?'
Suddenly, Max comes to joins us in the kitchen with relief written on his face. “I didn't know how to get through without pissing somebody off.”
Silver sneers at Max. “What the hell do you think you're doing?”
“What?” Max looks taken aback.
“Who said you could come to this party?” She places her hands on her hips.
“Well, I thought that if someone's throwing a party, then everyone's obliged to come.”
Silver tuts. “You thought wrong new guy, and for that you better watch out before someone really shows you how things are done around here.”
Max squares his shoulders and approaches her. “Silver, isn't it?”
She arches her brow in confirmation.
“See, where I come from, people don't usually talk like that and get away with things. I may not be good enough to pass as being a cool or a tough guy, but at least I have the decency to treat others with respect. Fair enough if you don't like me, because truth be told I'm not utterly fond of you either. So, the next time you threaten me or anyone I care about Silver, you won't like the outcome. That I assure you.”
Silver shakes her head and murmurs. “You're dead.” Then walks away.
He turns back to me with an expressionless look on his face. “Did you find Sam yet?”
I shake my head.
“We'll search the house. I'm sure she's fine Alice.”
Knowing Sam she's probably somewhere really obvious because she blends in so well with these people. Maybe she's found some guy to spend the night with and doesn't want to be disturbed, but as a concerned friend I just want to see for myself that she's okay.
“I think I'm gonna look for her upstairs to see if she's in one of the bedrooms. Do you mind checking outside?”
“Sure. We'll meet up in a few minutes by the campfire?” “Yeah.”
I rush out of the kitchen and make my way up the stairs. People are sitting on the steps which makes it extremely hard for me to pass - I slither my way as quickly as possible to reach the second level of the house and to my left, I see three doors, one of which is open, one ajar and one closed completely. I look to the right and see another three doors, two of which are open and one closed.
With my new ability, I try as hard as I can to reach out to hear Sam's voice but fail to hear her for I have no idea on how to use it.
With a disappointed sigh, I walk to the left side of the house and come face to face with the door that's ajar. The room is cast in blackness and the first thing I notice is the distinctive smell of beer and the sound of deep male voices. I open the door slowly only to see Bane and Kellan playing what looks like a first person shooting game, but the moment I step foot inside both of their heads turn in unison to my direction - it takes them a while to realize who I am. Bane looks at me for a second but loses interest and carries on playing the game, Kellan however smiles and gets up from his position on the couch.
“Alice! Didn't know you'd be attending our amazing party?” He picks me off the floor and crushes me tightly to his chest.
I scowl even though it's pretty hard to breathe considering his strength and the unmistakable smell of beer. “Please let go of me. You stink of alcohol.”
Kellan just chuckles. “I might be drunk right now, but I'm still happy to see you.”
He lets go of me and goes to sit back on the couch and picks up the controller, I take this as an opportunity to ask if either of them have seen Sam.
“Hey guys, have you seen Sam anywhere? She said she'd be at this party, but I can't seem to find her.”
Kellan thinks for a moment then nods. 'I saw her a few hours ago but she was more interested in our big sexy beast over here.” Kellan nudges Bane suggestively but receives what sounds like a menacing growl in return.
“Where is she now?”
Kellan shrugs. “I've no idea. One minute she was all over Bane, and the next she ran off crying.”
What could he have done to make her run off? “Bane?”
He doesn't acknowledge me. “Bane? What did you do?”
I wait a few seconds to see if he'll say anything but when I realize that he won't answer me, I march up to the TV and switch it off.
“What the fuck is your problem!?” He roars in agitation.
“Right now you're my problem asshole. What did you do to Sam?”
“Who the fuck is Sam?”
I can't believe this is the guy Sam's pining after. “Sam? The girl you were with that ran off crying.” My patience is starting to run out.
“I make a lot of girls cry. That's why it makes it easy to forget their faces.” Bane dismisses me as he gets up from the couch, looks out the window where he sees people
outside enjoying the party.
“This is not a joke Bane. Just please tell me where she went because I'm starting to think that something bad has actually happened to her, and with the murders going  on.	”
He sighs and turns to look at me and Kellan. “Relax, she followed me up here, but I told her to leave me alone cause she was trying too hard to get my attention. She chose to ignore that and started groping me that may have had me insulting her.”
“I thought you liked it when women got a little frisky with you.” Kellan winks jokingly at Bane.
“Shut your damn mouth Kellan!”
Kellan might be amused, but I certainly am not. “So, after you insulted her she ran off? Do you know where?”
“It's not like I give a shit but she ran into the bathroom at the other end of the hallway.”
“See? Was that really hard to tell me.”
I leave the room to go to the other end of the hall. I have no idea which of the three rooms is the bathroom so I decide to knock on the closed door and wait patiently.
“Sam?” I listen intently for anything on the other side but still nothing.
I call her name again when I hear footsteps on the other end of the hall and see Kellan.
“She's in there.”
“How do you know for sure?” I try the door only to find that it's locked.
“I've been hearing her crying in there for over an hour.” “You could have told me that earlier!”
“I was playing a game. I wanted to beat Bane because he kept kicking my ass!”
“I seriously couldn't care less! Just help me get her out!”
The door surprisingly opens and the first thing I see is Sam's tear stained face with mascara running down both of her cheeks.
“You guys are so loud I couldn't even concentrate on crying anymore.”
I pull her into my arms. “You scared the shit out of me when I couldn't find you. I started thinking the worst.”
She steps away and wipes her eyes. 'Tonight didn't go as I'd hoped, but I just wanna go home and get the hell away from here.”
Kellan grasps a hold of her hands and smiles reassuringly at her. “Ignore Bane and what he said to you because he's like that with everybody. Like a girl such as yourself, he was probably intimidated by your beauty.”
Sam smiles back at him but says nothing in response.
Is that a blush!?
“I think someone needs to lay off the alcohol	”
The door on the other end suddenly slams open with Bane rushing down the stairs, yelling at Kellan to follow him.
The three of us follow Bane outside where tons of people have stopped and created a circle around the campfire. It's hard for me to see what's going on inside the circle, but with Bane pushing his way to the front it soon reveals who is inside.
The first thing I see are two male bodies throwing punches at each other, when suddenly they both fall to the floor with their faces facing away from me. The larger one out of the two has black hair with a muscular build while the smaller one has golden hair.
The bigger male head-butts the other and gains the upper hand by sitting on top of the other male's abdomen and starts punching him repeatedly in the face. The smaller male lies unmoving on the floor as the dark haired male rises off the floor and roars in triumph, but when his green eyes meet mine, I freeze and run to the bloodied body lying on the floor.
I run past Silver where I see her applauding for Ryder with a smirk on her face.
Lying on his back in his own blood with his face unrecognizable is Max. His face covered with bruises and cuts that without knowing the colour of his hair, I wouldn't have been able to make out who the person was.
I kneel down beside him and feel completely relieved when I see his chest slowly rising and falling. I gently caress his bloodied cheek comfortingly, but when he tries to speak, blood pours out of his mouth.
“Shhh.” I plead. “Try not to speak, okay?”
I look around me to see people leaving to go inside the house to probably carry on with the party.
I can't believe that not one person stopped the fight. Why is it that a fight is seen as entertainment? People get severely hurt and for what? To show who's bigger or stronger? Who does Ryder think he is?
“Sam!” I call her name from my position next to Max.
The moment she comes over she gasps in horror at the sight in front of her. “Alice!?”
“Can you help me carry Max to his car please?”
I get up and ready myself to pick Max's beaten body off the floor when I hear Kellan call out my name from behind me. “Here let me.”
I watch as Kellan picks up Max effortlessly off the floor, and leads him into the forest and out to where his car is.
“Are you coming?” Sam stops in her tracks when she realizes that I'm not following her.
“You go ahead with Kellan. I'll be right behind you guys.”
I turn my back to her, and rush back into the house in search for Ryder.
Chapter 14

I ignore the fact that I have Max's blood on my hands, but that doesn't stop the blood from pumping in my ears and the feeling of adrenaline running through my entire body.
With Ryder nowhere in sight in the living area or the kitchen, I take the stairs and cross the right side of the room.
One of the previous doors that was closed is now empty which makes me turn to the other door that is closed shut. This gut feeling inside of me suggests that Ryder's in there - I stand corrected when I open the door to see that he's not alone. There's no jealousy or anger when I notice Ryder's body and a pair of legs wrapped around his waist, I feel only pity.
It's hard to see who the girl is, but there is no denying who might be kissing Ryder right now.
“You know, I genuinely feel sorry for you.”
Both heads swing towards the doorway, Ryder looks like he's seen a ghost while Silver looks like she wants to kill me for interrupting them.
“I thought you left.” Ryder gets up from the bed.
They may not have been sleeping together, but seeing them kissing each other, bothers me somehow, but I still can't stand to look at either of them.
“Oh no please, don't stop on my account seeing as you both don't give a shit that someone nearly died tonight.”
Silver laughs. “He deserved it. He accused Ryder, Bane and Kellan for something that they didn't do and came here unannounced. I mean seriously, he had it coming”
“Silver get out.”
Silver stops laughing instantly. “What?”
“Get the hell out!” Ryder yells, causing a shiver to run down my back.
Silver scurries to pick up her shoes off the floor and runs out of the room.
“Shut the door.” Ryder commands as he lounges on his black leather couch.
“No, I'm good here.”
I can sense that he's growing impatient with me but after tonight, he's changed to being a completely different person to whom I thought he was before, “Shut the damn door and sit down, Alice.”
“Don't tell me what to do! What you did tonight was brutal and horrific! Why would you do something like that!? Do you realize that Max could've died or do you not care at all? He's not an Alpha like you, so stop whatever grudge you have against him and let it go!”
Ryder doesn't say anything for a few minutes then shakes his head. “There's something wrong with him Alice and you refuse to see past the nice act he's putting on.”
“What? Max has been nothing but kind to me.” Ryder looks at me with a nasty scowl on his face.
“Explain the injuries then. Tell me that you're not curious about how he didn't have a scratch on him tonight.” “You mean before you decided to beat him up again.”
“I didn't beat him up the first time, but I wish I did because I'm telling you right now, he's a lying shit who's messing with the wrong people.”
I'm still curious about Max's injuries but I won't admit that to Ryder - I still haven't come up with an explanation on how it could've been possible, and so I refuse to give him the satisfaction of agreeing.
“Max's mother's a nurse, she probably...”
“Don't tell me you actually believe that!?” He interrupts me. “Why are you refusing to see what's actually in front of you!?”
“And what exactly is that?”
He shoves himself off the couch and storms towards me where I stand in the doorway. 'I don't know yet but I will! Give me a few days and I'll soon find out.”
“Sounds to me like you really want something to be wrong with him.”
Ryder leans down closer to me. “I do because I want him to stay as far away from you as possible.”
I shove his chest but I always seem to forget that his body is as hard as steel. “How can you say that!? You have no right to speak to me like that after what I saw you doing.”
He waves me off. “Silver's meaningless, and I have needs just like any other wolf does. Besides, it's not like I need to give you an explanation on who I'm being intimate with.”
“There'd be too many to count if I did ask you anyway.” I taunt.
It's silent for a few seconds then I take a deep breath. “I don't care that you've slept with Silver in the past because that's between you and her. I don't know why I came up here, but I know for one thing that I didn't like what I saw out there. For a second, I thought for sure Max was dead. Now there's something bigger going on in this town, and you're taking it out on some guy that has no idea about it. This shit with Max ends right now because when the next month is here we're gonna have another dead body. That's what we should be focusing on.”
My heart is beating by the time I finish talking, but I also feel relieved that I spoke freely about how I felt. I can't believe that a part of me feared about speaking my mind to someone like Ryder, but somehow I feel like I'm getting through to him slowly.
“I'm not promising anything Alice because if he gets in my way one more time, I'll do more than just throw in a couple of punches. He's up to something, and I'm gonna find out what it is. You need to open your eyes and see what kind of person he actually is before it's too late.”
It's my turn to shake my head. “You're wrong about him, but you're not gonna change the way you feel about him so it looks like I'm done here.”
I turn to walk away but stop when I hear my name coming from Ryder.
“What?”
“For once Alice, please listen to me on this.”
I don't answer him. Instead I walk down the stairs, ignore the people still dancing and evacuate the house. I pass the empty campfire and carry on walking into the woods and end up at the clearing. I spot Max's black Range Rover straight away and see Kellan pacing in front of the bright headlights.
A couple of steps towards the Range Rover, Kellan stops pacing and rushes towards me.
“How's he doing?”
All Kellan does is run his hand through his hair. “He's in a really bad way and he's losing a lot of blood. If we don't treat him soon it's gonna get worse.”
“I'll take him to my house, it's much closer than the hospital. My mom won't be there and I'll use her spare medical kit.”
I make my way towards the driver's side to see Max lying in the backseat with his head resting on Sam's lap.
As soon as I reach for the handle it's pulled back by Kellan's hand. 'I'll drive.”
“You've had a few drinks.”
“I have but now I'm sober. The alcohol wears off much quicker when you're a wolf.”
Well, that sucks.
The journey in the car was somewhat peaceful - no one spoke the whole time and in a way the silence was comfortable. I think all of us felt that silence was what we needed in that moment and as we arrived, the house cast in complete blackness was a welcoming feeling that I've longed for all day.
“You girls go inside and I'll bring him in.”
I place my hand reassuringly on his shoulder. “Kellan, you don't need to do this. You've done enough.”
“I might not like the guy, but he didn't deserve this.”
I rush into the house, turn on all the lights and look around for a place where Max can lie down.
Sam soon follows after with a distant look on her face. “Sam? You okay?”
She says nothing for a while then wipes her eyes, “This wasn't how the night should've ended.”
I grab the medical kit from under the sink and place it on the dining table. “You know, it's not your fault.”
“What's not my fault?” Sam crosses her arms over her chest.
“The situation with Bane. He's like that with everyone, and he won't change.”
She looks at me in disdain. “This isn't just about Bane. This is about how our friend almost got killed by a shapeshifter tonight, and to make things worse he doesn't even know that! Why are we associating ourselves with people like Ryder!? Before you got bitten, they didn't even know that we existed, and now they can't seem to stop following us. I'm going to be honest with you and say that I hate the fact that we now know about Mr. Daniels, and with what's going on in this town because I'm scared about what could be out there, whether it be something of the supernatural or not. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder in fear that something is coming after me.”
“Sam..”
Before I can respond to her, Kellan chooses that moment to bring in a bloodied Max into the house. I immediately guide him towards the dining table where he gently lays Max down on the table. I quickly wash my hands to avoid catching any kind of infection from the wounds Ryder inflicted on Max and rush back to the table.
“Do you need my help?” Kellan asks me just as I gently put pressure on the wounds with a sterile clean cloth to stop the bleeding.
“Thanks but I'm sure I can do it by myself being a nurse's daughter and all.”
I rush to one of the overhead cupboards and grab a bowl to fill up with water.
“If you need anything, just call me alright?”
Kellan disappears into the living room followed by a silent Sam.
I take the bowl to the table where Max silently lies and use the clear water to rinse the wounds on his face. Having no idea if open wounds are on his body, I take a pair of scissors from the medical kit and cut up the middle of his shirt. I close my eyes hoping that his body has been left unscathed, but when I open them, tears start to fall when I notice the purple bruises on both sides of his ribs.
With my fingers, I gently examine him to find out if there's any broken ribs, but sigh in relief when I don't feel anything out of place. I draw my attention back to his badly injured face and apply some antibiotic cream to help keep the cuts moist and to help the body's natural healing process. Through it all, Max doesn't flinch or show any kind of discomfort as I treat him.
I take out one of the chairs and sit next to him when suddenly he starts to stir. He looks around in confusion but soon relaxes when he sees me sitting next to him.
He sits up so effortlessly and hangs his legs over the table when he overcomes with dizziness, I rush to him quickly and hold his shoulders to help keep him from falling forwards. “You should be lying down.”
Max only chuckles. “Alice, I'm fine, honestly.”
“No, you shouldn't do this to yourself. Your body needs to rest.”
