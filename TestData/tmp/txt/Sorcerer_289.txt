The Riverwench abruptly lifted her head. “What?”
Without warning Gatril licked the female’s labia and shot her tongue inside with electrifying grace. She grabbed the Riverwench’s bottom and held her steady as she contorted out of control, still sensitive from Kiran’s first round. 
“In that case,” said Kiran as he corked the jar and put it away in his backpack, “I’ll deal with you face-to-face.”
Kiran went to the Riverwench’s head and held her cheeks. She spotted the reddish tip of his veiny manhood and shuddered. “W-What are you doing?”
“Just letting off some steam,” said Kiran. “You don’t want to?”
Gatril nibbled on her clitoris and the Riverwench abruptly reeled like a horse, falling back on her hands. “P-Please!” she said. “I won’t eat humans or selkies anymore! This is embarrassing! Just let—”
Kiran silenced her by ramming his phallus into her mouth. The Riverwench choked and grabbed his waist to prevent him from thrusting, but her last orgasm left her a tad weary, powerless to stop Kiran from pounding her face. His balls slapped against her chin, and he closed his eyes and threw back his head as his mind melted away.
“Wow, you have a good mouth,” Kiran said, but his sex mate could only reply with garbled sounds and saliva running from her mouth. 
The Riverwench’s body shuddered once again as another orgasm consumed her. She clenched Kiran’s waist tighter to the point where he felt he was going to break.
“Ouch!” he said. “Hey, careful!”
Gatril took her face out of the Riverwench’s behind, licking the excess fluids from her lips. “Hey, Kiran. I’m hot over here.”
Kiran stopped, the Riverwench sighed inwardly. “Okay. Come over here and I’ll help you out.”
Kiran pulled out of the Riverwench’s mouth. He let go of her and she laid her head on her arms. “I-I’m so tired.”
“Don’t worry,” said Kiran. “I’ve already got what I wanted.”
Gatril grabbed Kiran’s penis. “Yeah,” she said, “now you’re gonna give me what I want.”
Kiran and Gatril quickly finished up in the missionary position. His thrusts and her contractions produced and intense heat in their groins that had them climaxing almost instantaneously. 
They recovered and gathered their belongings, after which they cut the rubbery material from around the Riverwench’s feet. She stood unsteadily, almost losing her balance. She made no hostile action but her face wore an expression of pure hate.
“Okay,” said Kiran, “you will have to leave the jungle now. Or you can stay and leave the selkies and humans alone.”
She grunted. “Fine,” she said. “I will stay, and keep away from them.”
“Good,” said Gatril. “Or we’ll come back here and give you some more good loving.”
“Thank you miss Riverwench,” said Kiran. “Your queex will really help me. Well, we’ll be leaving now.”
“Wait,” she said. “before you go…at least know my name. I’m not a whore for a human to mount and leave.”
Kiran said, “Okay… What is your name?”
“Kundis,” she said. “That is the name I choose to go by.”
Kiran nodded. “Kundis. That’s a nice name.”
Kundis didn’t smile at the compliment, but simply said. “I need to rebuild my nest. Good night, Kiran.” And she turned and went into the trees.
Kiran held Gatril’s hand. “Come on. Let’s go back.”

After Kiran returned to the cottage and reported the news to Eyeka and the selkies, he was given their gratitude, which was enough for him, even though Gatril urged him to ask her for her queex.
The pair snuck back to the inn under the cover of night. Kiran had himself a bath in the shower, as Gatril had already cleaned herself in the river. When Kiran returned to his room he relaxed in the bed next to Gatril, both naked. There was no arousal amongst them, but they enjoyed the warmth of each other.
It was in the middle of the night when Kiran was awakened to Gatril munching on some meat in the corner of the room. He rubbed the stagnation out of his eyes and said, “Late night snack?”
“Well, I can’t exactly go downstairs,” she said, taking another bite of her jaguar meat.
Kiran chuckled and rolled out of the covers. He put on his underpants, ran his hands through his dreadlocks and went over to the wardrobe where he had his things. “I might as well work on the spell while I’m up.”
Kiran took out the jar of queex along with a paper containing fish scales and powdered aquamarine stone. He sat on the floor before Gatril, sneaking glances at her as he worked. 
“Is something wrong?” said Gatril.
