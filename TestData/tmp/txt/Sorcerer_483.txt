But in the distance, Kiran and Gatril saw it.
“There’s a cave!” said Gatril, her keen eyesight catching it before the human.
The dark hollow was supplanted into the side of a high mound. Threads stained in yellow split from the mouth and matted around it. The plants were withered as if the threads were robbing them of life, and the pungent smell tripled.
Kiran spun around with his staff, ready. But to his surprise the spiders hesitated. “Look, they stopped.”
Gatril witnessed the once bloodthirsty arachnids stalling, placing their feet forward and back, hesitant as their food was so close, yet so was the abode of the female. 
“Are they afraid of the female?” said Gatril.
“At least they aren’t going to kill us anymore.” Kiran took Gatril’s arm and walked back into the cave, keeping his eyes on the males just in case they mustered enough courage to come closer. 
The sunlight died soon inside, and Kiran felt goosebumps all over him. “We forgot the lantern back on the quacycle,” he said. “Gatril, can you by any chance breathe fire yet?”
“Not naturally like my stomach acid,” she said. “If we had some potassium and glycerin to eat I could though.”
Kiran channeled his spirit energy into his staff. “I guess it’s a good thing I made this spell with Trewanti’s queex.”
Kiran activated his fourth spell from a white orb with blue streaks. Light swelled from it, forming its photons into the shape of an eye. The iris sparkled and a second body of radiance stung the dark out of existence, revealing a rocky ceiling from which twisting roots ran into the walls and floor, all covered in moss. Insects who relished the dark hurried from the scorching light exuding from Kiran’s staff.
“Shall we?” said Kiran.
Gatril shoved Kiran along. “Stop trying to sound all fancy like.”
Kiran and Gatril found two separate, winding paths. The angle making it seem the lumpy walls intended to close and chew them up. The first one they took revealed insects and small rodents who expertly traverse the surface of the web-laden walls and ceiling. It seemed to have been an adaptation, which made Gatril in particular wonder how long the j’bafofi had been here.
The width of the path grew as they went, seeming more befitting of the massive beast fabled to live inside here. Then they reached the end, but contrary to the fangs, claws and beady eyes they were expecting, a mass of corpses piled on top of each other stood at the end, waiting on them like some sick trick.
“Holy crap…” Kiran tried to contain the urge to vomit, triggered by the scent that burnt his lungs. 
“They’re hundreds of them,” said Gatril.
The corpses were a menagerie of humans, beasts and animals, like a deranged necromancer’s collection. The ones at the very bottom were nothing but bones infused with moss and other discoloration over time, while at the top the newcomers still had their skin, though it was shriveled, and with the impact of the moisture had sagged and fused with heat of the others as if they were all trying to become one—souls locked together in an embrace of death. 
Kiran pointed the light above the bodies, where they found a tunnel leading to probably the source of where all these remains came from.
Kiran shuddered as if he could feel multiple hairy legs on him. “It’s like this place is—”
“A dumpster,” Gatril finished. She saw rats scrabbling to the top where others nibbled at the scraps of flesh left. “Come. We should go.”
They went back to the beginning of the fork in the cave and took the other path. This one was larger, very. Big enough to permit an elephant passage. Gatril’s intuition gnawed at her body and she readied her cannon. Kiran drew his knife just for safe measure.
And it came so unsuspectingly that it had the same effect as something leaping out of the dark to bite them. A sweet tune, a hum that came from a throat of liquid crystal. It was soft and reassuring, like the lullabies Kiran’s mother would sing to him.
“What? Who is that?” Kiran wondered if the cave was playing tricks on him. The song was unbefitting of the accursed hole they’d wondered into. It had to be a trap; a siren’s song to lure wary sailors to their doom, as his grandfather would tell Kiran at night when he visited the old man.
And then came an orange glow from around the bed. Faint, flickering, casting jagged shadows on the walls.
“Are you sure we’re in the right place?” said Kiran.
Gatril gestured to the ground briefly. “The webs here are a bit fresh. And now that I know the scent of spiders, it’s like this one’s right under my nose.”
They closer they got the slowler their steps became. But it seemed by the room they found, they had been right to be so cautious in their approach.
A flame burnt in a bronze urn close to the wall, and the essence of freshly sundered wood and mint seeped from it. Thick branches were stuck to the walls of the chamber, holding enough books that seemed to be the humble beginnings of a library. In the corners of the room were trinkets, jewelry that sparkled from the grace of the flames. And in the center, there she was.
It was something humanoid, female in shape, but the body parts composed of jointed limbs and a segmented torso. She had four long arms, each ending in four digits, and her pelvis was squishy looking and pink, contrasting the brown of her chitinous body. The thighs were thick and attached to the outermost of pelvis, from which a long tail hung, tipped with spinnerets. Her six eyes were occupied by a book before, her mandibles clicking thoughtfully as she processed the information, and she briefly brushed back a lock of her black hair with a hand.
But the legs weren’t set in preparation for a lunging attack. The hands weren’t about to wring their necks, and her fangs weren’t dripping neurotoxin in the hindsight of puncturing their flesh. Even when she lifted her head from the book she was reading and spared them a glance, she looked away, only to do a double take as if surprised by who was there instead of the fact that they snuck up upon her.
“Who are you two?” she said, her voice high pitched but grainy.
“My name is Kiran Kehomba,” the boy said. “I’m sorcerer seeking the queex of a j’bafofi. I came here seeking your assistance.”
The six eyes turned to the bosdrake. “And who is this?” the spider said.
“I’m Gatril,” she said. “I’m his friend.”
