“I think someone needs to lay off the alcohol	”
The door on the other end suddenly slams open with Bane rushing down the stairs, yelling at Kellan to follow him.
The three of us follow Bane outside where tons of people have stopped and created a circle around the campfire. It's hard for me to see what's going on inside the circle, but with Bane pushing his way to the front it soon reveals who is inside.
The first thing I see are two male bodies throwing punches at each other, when suddenly they both fall to the floor with their faces facing away from me. The larger one out of the two has black hair with a muscular build while the smaller one has golden hair.
The bigger male head-butts the other and gains the upper hand by sitting on top of the other male's abdomen and starts punching him repeatedly in the face. The smaller male lies unmoving on the floor as the dark haired male rises off the floor and roars in triumph, but when his green eyes meet mine, I freeze and run to the bloodied body lying on the floor.
I run past Silver where I see her applauding for Ryder with a smirk on her face.
Lying on his back in his own blood with his face unrecognizable is Max. His face covered with bruises and cuts that without knowing the colour of his hair, I wouldn't have been able to make out who the person was.
I kneel down beside him and feel completely relieved when I see his chest slowly rising and falling. I gently caress his bloodied cheek comfortingly, but when he tries to speak, blood pours out of his mouth.
“Shhh.” I plead. “Try not to speak, okay?”
