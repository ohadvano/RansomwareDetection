“Oh, that’s simple,” said Gatril as she stood and removed her bra and loincloth. “I’ll just get the queex from her for him. You can stimulate Kiran while he watches.”
Kiran shot Aparna a startled glance. It seemed outrageous to think this newcomer would be willing to join their special recreational activity. Aparna met Kiran with a contemplative, almost cynical stare, making him retract his neck in embarrassment.
Kiran turned to Gatril and said, “I think Aparna would be more willing to get the queex from her while you do me.”
“That’s fine,” said Aparna. 
“I-It is?” stammered Kiran.
Aparna stood and took off her clothes. “I’ve always wanted to try a Tatanuese man.”
Aparna’s pubic hair was shaved in a “V” pattern. The fresh smell of bitterweed and sweat wafted off into Kiran’s nose, arousing his sense like an intoxicating drug. 
Aparna gently laid next to Kiran and pulled down his underwear, stroking his swelling penis. She kissed him, and brought her chest up to his face where he could see her dark nipples ready and waiting. As Kiran nibbled and sucked on them, his flaccid phallus had swollen into a sturdy pole.
Gatril got a bowl and got behind the popobawa, sitting her down in her lap and spreading open her legs. Kiran multitasked amongst milking Aparna’s nipple, fingering the inside of her warm damp crotch and watching as Gatril placed the jar between the popobawa’s legs, kissing her cheek and neck.
The popobawa felt Gatril’s clawed fingers slide inside her and winced. “Aah! S-Slow down!”
“Quiet,” said Gatril, and locked her lips with hers, swiveling her tongue in her mouth. The bosdrake tweaked the popobawa’s nipple and vigorously fingered her. The popobawa moaned against her will, unwittingly riding the hand inside her with the contractions.
Aparna applied another wet kiss on Kiran’s lips before she knelt over him and slowly crawled back. Her dark, mysterious eyes glinted like black pearls, locking Kiran in an entrancement. She took his penis and nibbled on it. Kiran bit his lips and twisted his nose. Aparna licked his shaft from the base to the tip. Then she engulfed it.
Kiran had thought the inside of a woman’s vagina was spectacular, but Aparna was proving him silly for ever having considered such a thing. 
As Aparna vibrated her tongue on the tip of Kiran’s penis, her lips applied suction that almost pulled the blood out of him, bobbing her head with the force of a engine’s piston. Kiran clenched his teeth and clutched the leaves on the floor, resisting the urge to scream. Across from him Gatril unleashed upon the popobawa a cataclysmic sensation as well that had her making muffled screams. Spit and froth fell from between her and Gatril’s lips, as did Aparna’s mouth as she vacuumed the energy from Kiran.
Kiran unleashed a mighty roar, as he did his semen slapped into the back of Aparna’s mouth. The popobawa screamed. Her body quaked, and like a busted pipe her queex sprayed on the floor and inside the bowl.
Gatril took her tongue out of the popobawa’s mouth and allowed the woman to catch her breath. Gatril pushed her aside and took up the bowl. While she brought it over to a jar, Aparna approached the popobawa on the ground and took her by the head. Aparna’s lips were tight, and she pried open the popobawa’s mouth. She was too weak to resist as Aparna slowly opened her lips, and the semen plopped onto her tongue.
“Now be a good girl and swallow,” Aparna said.
The popobawa reluctantly ingested the semen, grimacing. “That was disgusting.”
Aparna patted her head and kissed her. “That’s karma for you.” She laid the woman onto her back and stooped over her face. “Now, time for round two.”
“That’s right,” said Gatril, also with her bottom over Kiran’s face. “Time for you two to make us feel good.”
“At least my tongue isn’t injured,” said Kiran, giggling along with the other women. The popobawa, though frustrated with its defeat, was at least pleased to know a cock wouldn’t be penetrating her, and as Aparna and Gatril sat, both her and Kiran leisurely began eating out the snatch of the women.
Kiran and the popobawa were experts in their own right, able to maintain a rigid flexibility to their tongues while the women bounced on their faces. Aparna and Gatril increased their pace as they made sensuous moans. Aparna was first to reach her climax, then Gatril.
The popobawa licked the scented liquid off her face, savoring the taste. “You Gabanyese women are spicy.”
Aparna saw a tiny smile on the popobawa’s face. “Thanks for the compliment,” she said.
Getting up, Gatril said, “Sounds like someone’s enjoying themselves. In that case…” Gatril gestured for Aparna to get off the popobawa, and the bosdrake cut her restraints with a claw. She helped her to her feet and motioned to Kiran. “Why don’t you finish things off for us.”
The popobawa saw Kiran looking at her expectantly, stroking his still rigid cock with one hand. He smiled at her. She made a frown, but Kiran could tell it was forced. “Why don’t you come over here and…have a seat.”
The popobawa smirked. “None of you tell anyone about this.”
“My lips are sealed,” said Gatril. She turned and kissed Aparna—stuck her fingers inside her. “Let’s cuddle.”
The popobawa crawled over Kiran. She kissed him on his lips, his chin, his neck. With one hand she steadied his penis and slowly sat on it. She moaned softly at the pressure against her insides at the size that filled her. “…Boy…you have a gift it seems.”
Kiran held on her waist with his one hand, while she pressed against his chest. The popobawa started out with slow motions of with her hips. She leaned over Kiran and offered her breasts to him, and happily obliging, the boy sucked on each of them. 
The popobawa chuckled and held him close. Their love sounds filled the nest, with Aparna and Gatril watching from the other side. Once the popobawa felt Kiran’s grip tighten on her flesh she knew what was coming. She clenched her muscles and held him in place as Kiran’s warm juices flooded inside her. The popobawa closed her eyes and as the hot fluid nestled inside her, her flesh willingly absorbing everything he had to offer.
“Wow,” said Gatril. “That was…”
“Sensual,” said Aparna.
“Well,” Gatril said, “I was thinking more of, fricking aces!”
