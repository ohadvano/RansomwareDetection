I find myself walking out of her bedroom to somehow escape. “I'm not talking about this with you.”
Sam follows. “Yeah, but aren't you a little curious about what sex is like?” I turn to look at Sam.
“Honestly Sam, I haven't thought about it and it didn't even cross my mind.”
Sam sticks her tongue out playfully. “Until now.” “Look, we just kissed, that's all. No big deal.” End of discussion.
I turn back around and walk into the kitchen to put the kettle on. “Tea?”
“Please.”
Sam sits at the table and takes her phone out of her pocket. “Can I ask you a question?”
Sam puts her phone down on the table and frowns. “Sure.” “How did you have Ryder's number?”
Sam shifts her weight on the seat and plays with her phone. “I got it the other day at school when you and Max were getting food together. Ryder sat at the next table and he wanted to exchange numbers in case anything happened to you, so I gave it to him.”
