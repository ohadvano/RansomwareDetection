“Is she gonna be okay?”
“Her teeth and claws have formed perfectly but..” Ryder places his hand on my abdomen.
“But what?” Sam sits next to me on the bed.
“Her bones need to break through, and it's not gonna be pretty.”
Ryder holds my hand reassuringly.
Sam crosses her arms over her chest. “Will that be the last thing that happens to her because I can't stand to see her like this?”
“Sam, it needs to happen whether she likes it or not. She was stupid enough to fight the first time. She would have avoided all of this if she would have listened to me.”
Sam jumps off the bed and confronts Ryder. “How dare you speak about her like that! It's not her fault!”
I'm lying on the bed drenched in sweat with my whole body in indescribable pain when I notice that both Sam and Ryder arguing. I struggle to open my mouth to make them stop, but I can't do anything other than listen to them.
