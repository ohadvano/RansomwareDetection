
The last thing I wanted do right now is to have a conversation with Ryder. I'd rather stick pins in my eyes and cut out my tongue than speak to him. But here we are, in the middle of the night.
“Look, I'm really tired and a little pissed off with you and your friends. So just say what you got to say and leave me alone.”
Hopefully, he'll never have to speak to me again. “What happened to you last night?”
I should have moved when I had the chance because right now, my boobs are getting to know his chest really well.
“Absolutely nothing. And anyway, it's not like I owe you an explanation.”
Ryder cages me in with both of his hands on either side of my head. “You think I didn't see you inside that diner? We all did! So I need to know what happened to you last night.”
“Why is it so important for you to know?” I duck underneath his arm, and start walking.
“Alice! You need to listen to me.”
