As I stand at the clearing, I feel nothing but power. I've experienced the feeling of becoming close to death, and I couldn't feel more alive.
I dash through the forest and leap over the thin winding creeks and the slippery rocks. I dodge and zip past rotting oak trees and under lowered branches. Bugs zip in and out of my ears, humming and buzzing their little song. Green leaves, yellow leaves and red leaves scatter on the ground like a rainbow of rich, autumnal colours. Ahead, the forest trees get thinner.
I'm close to home.
As I draw closer, I see the old worn bridge that leads to the road opposite my home.
Home sweet home.
I live with my mother in a quiet residential area in a beautiful detached house. It's been the only home I've ever lived in, and there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be because of the silence and peacefulness the house provides. The house has a big garden with beautiful trees, plants and even a swimming pool. The house is pretty spacious for only the two of us, with two floors and a smaller third floor with big windows.
The gate is on the ground floor where the big hall communicates with two comfortable airy living rooms, a bathroom, and a modern large kitchen is placed in the heart of the house. One living room has a door that leads out to the terrace that overlooks the garden. On the first floor are four rooms which consist of two doubles and two singles with two bathrooms.
My mother sleeps in the main bedroom which has its own bathroom and her own balcony.
I walk across the road and reach the wraparound porch in front of the house, and turn the handle to see that it's locked.
