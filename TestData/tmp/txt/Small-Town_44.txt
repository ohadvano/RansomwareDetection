People say that the crime scene was like something out of a horror film. Nevertheless, Kellan lost a part of himself after losing Anna, and I didn't blame him.
“What makes her so special? I bet she has like a magic vagina or something plus, she's probably slept with all three of them.”
I look away from Kellan just as he passes by us, and gasp at my best friend. “Sam, stop staring before she beats you up as well as you ending up in the hospital!”
“What? It's not like she can hear me.”
I grab Sam's hand and drag her down the corridor towards our English class. We take our seats near the front row, take out the reading book and wait for Mr Daniels. “Honestly, I guarantee you that she's sleeping with one of them.” Sam points with the tip of her pen to the back of the class without looking back. I look over my shoulder towards the back and see the four of them sitting together, but neither of them speak to each other. Silver sits beside Ryder as always. She always remains by his side.
I look over at Ryder, his expression remaining impassive as Silver strokes his arm compassionately. Anyone could tell just by looking at her that she's in awe of him. Kellan on the other hand, remains silent and sits with his elbows on the table, his head resting between them. Bane sits with his legs crossed on top of the table with his hands resting behind his head. He looks around the room like he's observing everything around him. Only then did it hit me. “Sam!” I hit her hand as I'm turning around and accidentally knock the pen out of her hand.
“That's my favourite pen.” She points down towards the floor. “It never hurt anybody.”
“Are they even supposed to be in this class? Why am I only realizing this now?” I motion towards the back and tilt my head to the back of the room.
“It's the middle of senior year so...no. The school doesn't let people change course in the middle of the year but I don't know. Maybe they worked something out with Mr Daniels?”
She picks up her pen and inspects the damage “You owe me a new pen by the way. This fountain pen was a gift I got on my birthday.”
“Yeah, sure.” I look towards the back of the class again, only to realize that they're all staring back at me. They really were intimidating.
Silver tilts her head to the side and stares at me with a hateful glare, while Bane's jaw ticks.
I knit my brows and look towards Kellan. He smiles a small smile, his eyes crinkle at the sides when I smile back at him. He only smiles for a second, then looks down at his desk again. I move my head completely to face Ryder, and for the first time in years, I really take a good look at him.
He has a chiselled shaped face with tanned spotless skin. Emerald green eyes that keep you staring, but his eyes hold no threat nor hatred, just a pure curious stare. I look at him as he stares back at me to see him smirking. His lips are full, yet firm.
I bet he's kissed a lot of girls with those lips...
After adjusting his beanie, he slicks his shiny black hair to the side and sticks his tongue out at me. I knit my brows in confusion again, and turn around, “Asshole.”
As I face the front of the class all I hear is Ryder laughing from the back.
Shit! Can he lip-read!?
“Who's the asshole?” Sam looks around the room to find the culprit but only finds me staring at her.
She points to herself in panic. “If this is about the pen don't worry about it.”
“No it's nothing. I'm just not up for work tonight.” I pick up the book and skim over the blurb.
“Behind on homework? I can help you at the diner tonight if you want?'
“Thanks, but I'm sure I'll be able to catch up on time.”
I pull out a pen from my pencil case just as the door to the classroom opens.
Is Mr. Daniels off sick today?
“Good morning students, my name is Mr Edmund, and I will be your English teacher for the rest of the school semester. I believe you are reading the novel Wuthering Heights. Can anyone volunteer to start us off?”
He writes his name on the whiteboard as Oliver Edmund. “Where's Mr. Daniels?”
“I'm not obliged to share that information with you, Ms. Frey.”
He turns around, and stares at Sam with his cold demeanour.
“Sir? We were promised to have our test results back today.”
This practice test was everything I needed to pass for next weeks exam. If I'm going to fail another class, I'm not sure I'm going to survive the rest of senior year.
“Alice, isn't it?”
He walks down the aisle holding the clipboard that holds everyone's name, and tilts his head to the side.
“That is correct, yes.” I say with a calm, and collected voice.
“Always raise your hand if you have a question.”
He does a once over on me, then walks to the front of the class, and points to the board.
“I'm your teacher now. Whatever Mr Daniels taught you before, forget about it because he's not coming back.”
He claps his hands together and looks at me. “Now Alice, why don't you start reading for us. Chapter 8, I presume?” He sits down in the chair, and motions with his hand for me start reading.
Where are you, Mr. Daniels?
Chapter 3

At six o'clock, I work my way towards the back of the diner to the office, where Robbie sits behind his desk on the phone.
“Yes, love. Of course, I'll make sure to buy the right one this time, alright love you too. Bye.”
He looks at me with his toothless grin. “Alice, how are you?”
“I'm good, thank you, but I just wanted to ask you if there's an extra uniform here somewhere?”
“What happened to the uniform you have?”
He stands from the old wooden chair, and looks in the cardboard boxes that are placed at the back of the office.
“I spilt some coffee on the shirt, and the stain won't come off.”
I can't lie for shit, but he seems to be buying it.
He sits back down just as he hands me a new uniform, “Be careful this time, alright? I mean, I know you like your coffee, but if it happens again, I'm going to have to ask you to pay for it.”
I take the uniform from him, “Thank you, Robbie, and this time I promise to be more careful.”
I walk rapidly towards the bathroom, lock the door and look at myself in the mirror. I had a heart-shaped face with rosy coloured cheekbones. My never-ending white blonde hair is always kept in a braid down my back. Ivory skin with bright pale blue eyes; like the clear sky. My mother tells me that my eyes are like the colour of diamonds, eyes that are so pale they could appear as white. My teeth are perfectly straight and white after years of my mother lecturing me about how to look after them. My nose is a little on the prominent side, but you can blame my father for that. Thankfully, that's the only thing I have of him.
I've never known my father, nor will I ever want to know him.
After a few moments I sigh, close my eyes and rest my hands on either side of the sink.
Just get it over and done with!
I open my eyes and take off my shirt swiftly, and look over my shoulder to look at the bite.
“What the hell...?”
I look in the mirror to see nothing but pure smooth skin, “Where is it...?”
Not a single bite mark was to be seen.
I didn't understand. It happened just hours ago and yet it's gone?
After changing into my uniform, I walk out of the bathroom and place myself behind the counter, but I couldn't concentrate on doing anything. Questions kept interrupting my thoughts, but I couldn't answer either of them. Maybe it healed overnight?
I peel my shirt over my right shoulder and check again. Nothing.
“Christ, Alice, you trying to give these people a strip tease or something?”
I roll my eyes when I hear her voice. I look towards the front of the diner to see Sam walking towards me with her school bag draped over her shoulder. She takes out her laptop and today's homework, and sits directly in front of me on our new red diner stools.
“I'll have a strawberry milkshake and a few fries please.” She types away on her laptop as I prepare the milkshake.
I walk to the kitchen to see Terry preparing the food for the waiting customers.
“Another order of fries on its own but it's Sam, so take your time, okay”' I do a thumbs up but he doesn't see it, or he's probably ignoring it.
As I walk back into the diner, I realize it's not as busy as I thought it would be.
“Alice, the milkshake's kinda overflowing.” Sam says nonchalantly.
“Shit!”
I rush to the milkshake machine, clean up the mess and pass it over the counter.
“Thank you kindly.” Sam takes a sip of the milkshake, sighs in delight and puts away the laptop.
“So, what do you think of our new English teacher? Hot right?” She winks at me. “I mean, I would.”
“Sam! He's like forty years old!” I hit her with the dishcloth that I keep on my shoulder.
“Age is just a number!”
All the patrons in the diner stop talking, turn in their chairs and stare at the two of us as we laugh over Sam's infatuation with our new teacher. I apologize immediately to them for our adolescent behaviour.
“Sam seriously, he's old enough to be your father.” I clean the counter to look busy when the diner door opens.
Almost immediately, I notice everything falling silent.
I glance over to see why the place has gone quiet, only to see four tall frames at the diner's entrance.Why were they here? They looked so out of place.
Bane walks with confidence towards the closest patron, leaving the other three standing guard at the door. He leans down to one of the regulars and speaks to him. I didn't know how I could hear him, but I heard every single word.
“You might wanna stop staring at us before I tear you apart piece by piece big man.”
“Hey!” I rush from behind the counter, stand directly in front of him only to be met with a broad chest.
“I don't care who you are, but I won't have you talking to the regulars like that.”
At this point, Ryder stands by Bane's side, never taking his eyes away from me.
“Are you saying we aren't welcome here because we're not regulars?” Bane looks at me with pure disgust written on his face.
“Of course, you're welcome here, but if you're going to disrespect the regulars then I'm going to have to ask you to leave.”
I say this with as much confidence as I can muster, but with Ryder standing with his eyes on me the whole time, I'm really quite surprised I haven't shat myself.
“We aren't here to start trouble. We just came to have some food in this highly recommended diner that you have here.” Ryder's voice fills the whole diner. While he speaks, I can't help but stand there looking into his bright green eyes.
“Well, as long as you don't start trouble, take a seat, and I'll grab you some menus.” I say.
Neither of us takes our eyes away from each other, but the connection is broken too quickly when I hear Sam's voice calling me.
“Alice! Where the hell are my goddamn fries!?”
I turn around to see Sam giving me the grumpiest look ever known to mankind.
Without looking at Ryder, I excuse myself and walk behind the counter, my hands shake as I grab four menus and four pairs of cutlery. I glance up again to see Ryder sitting in one of the booths with his friends, but his eyes remain on me.
“I'm known for being a patient person, but please give me my fries!”
“I told Terry to take his time, so whenever Terry's ready to make your fries, he'll make them.”
I walk past the counter, and laugh when I hear Sam confronting Terry in the kitchen.
While that's happening, I stand at the edge of the table and hand Ryder all the menus.
“I'll be back in a few minutes to take your order. Kitchen closes at seven thirty.” I hurry back to the cashier, when I notice Sam sitting back in her seat, with a few fries on a plate.
“Those aren't yours, are they?” I point towards the fries on the plate just as I hear Terry yelling from the kitchen.
“Nope, but they're mine now.” She grabs for another fry just as her elbow knocks the milkshake over, and that's when everything happens in slow motion.
Time slows down as I see the milkshake descend to the floor. I feel this uncontrollable urge to catch it before it falls. With the time slowing down, it gives me enough time to catch it, just inches before it spills everywhere. I look at the milkshake resting in my hand and check around me to see if anyone noticed, but I'm only met with four curious sets of eyes.
“Nice reflexes you got there Alice.”
Sam doesn't seem as freaked out like I am right now. Instead, she picks up another fry just as I slam down the milkshake on the counter, to which it topples over.
My breath hitches, “You didn't see that?”
“See what? You rescuing my delicious milkshake that is now spilling everywhere on this counter?”
“Sam, honestly, I'm freaking out right now!” “Are you okay? Want me to call your mum?”
“No, I just. I need to tell you something about what happened here last night.” I whisper to her over the counter in the hope that nobody hears me.
“What's going on with you today? And why are you whispering? No one's looking at us.”
“They're watching.” I answer.
Sam remains looking at them until she turns around and tells me that they're leaving.
“What's the problem? What happened last night?”
I take a steady breath, and replay the events of last night. “I was working here last night until closing hour. Terry and I were the only ones left at the diner. He asked me to take the trash out to the dumpster and I heard a growl from behind me. It was so quiet I thought I didn't hear anything, but I turned around and saw the biggest wolf I've ever seen, and I've never seen a wolf that big before in Small Town.”
Sam rolls her eyes. “I mean we see wolves all the time, we live in Small Town for gods sakes! We're gonna see wolves running around and for one being here, it was probably drawn to the smell of rotting food or something.”
Sam grabs her schoolbag from the floor, and starts packing her things.
“Sam, I'm telling you, it was huge! It bit me right on the shoulder and ran away!”
Sam stops packing her thing, and looks at me with pure worry on her face.
“It bit you? Did you tell your mum to look at it?”
I shake my head knowing she's about to have an outburst. “No.”
“Why the hell not!? She's a nurse! God knows what that thing carries.”
“There wasn't any point in telling her because by the time I went to bed the cuts were all sealed closed, and the marks were completely gone when I changed for work.”
I show her my shoulder to find it still the same. No bite marks.
“Why didn't you say anything in school?”
“I didn't think it really mattered when I woke up this morning and only saw a few cuts there.” A pause.
“I wish I knew what to tell you or at least give you advice but...”
Sam remains calm and collected, but I know that on the inside she worries too.
“Your milkshake would have been on the floor if I hadn't moved to grab it in time. I'm telling you now, everything in this room moved in slow motion like the time was slowing down for me to catch it before it leaked on the floor. And then hearing Bane whispering to Paul to stop staring or he'd tear him apart. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he's sitting right by the door and I'm all the way back here! Something's wrong with me!”
I turn around to face the coffee machine and pour myself a large cup of coffee.
Sam speaks to me in a quiet and comforting tone, she probably knows that I'm close to losing my mind.
“This all happened after it bit you?”
“Yeah, and it scares me to even think about what could happen to me. What if I actually turn into one?” I turn around with my mug of coffee and sit next to her.
Sam scoffs, “You're my best friend, and whatever happens just know that I'll be there for you. Even if you don't want my help, you shouldn't go through this alone. So, if you do turn into a big scary wolf, which is impossible by the way, I promise not to tell anyone. The last thing I want is you chasing me on a full moon.”
Sam stays with me till the end of the shift but leaves shortly when her mother comes to take her home. Sally offers to take me home, but I politely decline because I've got to lock up the diner.
I take out the trash, brush and mop the floor, then change out of my uniform. I lock up the back and exit through the front.
I double check that the door is locked when I hear rustling coming from behind me. I shrug it off blaming the wind, but when I hear it again I can't help but think it's the wolf from last night. I stay rooted to the ground in absolute fright when I hear laughter coming from behind me.
I turn around a little too quickly, and fall forwards on the floor.
“I didn't know for sure, but I had to check to see if I was right and now that I know, I was right about you.”
I look up into Ryder's cold, distrusting green eyes.
I stand with unsteady legs, and shiver when my back connects with the diner's cold, damp door, “What are you talking about?”
Ryder, Bane and Silver create a half circle around me. Ryder was standing in front of me while the other two stands on either side.
Kellan remains a little further behind Ryder, showing no signs of joining this little confrontation.
Silver steps forward, grabs my braid and pulls my head back hard. She leans forward right into my jugular and inhales. “She's new, but she's changing fast. I wouldn't be surprised if she changes tonight if she survives that is.”
She shoves my head forward and stands back.
It's Bane's turn to step forward. He stands in front of me, shielding Ryder from view. Bane reaches out with his giant-sized hand and wraps his hand around my delicate throat. “Let's get one thing clear here. I don't like you nor will I ever like you. I don't trust easily when it comes to people like you. His scent is all over you, and it's taking every ounce of control I have not to kill you.”
“Kill me?” I stutter.
“I promise you, if you get in my way and humiliate me again as you did in there, I'll kill you myself.”
I reach with both of my hands to stop Bane from strangling me. His figure goes all blurry, when suddenly his hand disappears from my throat. I fall to the ground like a rag doll on all fours, and start gasping for air.
I hear them arguing above me, but I can't make out a single word.
I look up with blurry eyes to see Kellan standing in front of me in a protective stance.
“He was killing her and you weren't gonna do shit about it! She's got nothing to do with the murders here!”
Ryder's head tilts to the side as he listens to Kellan, “You don't know that. Anyway, leave us. I need to have a little conversation with Alice. Alone.”
Both Silver and Bane snicker like hyenas as they run into the middle of the road.
“Kellan, leave. I'm not going to hurt her.”
Ryder kneels down in front of me and cups my cheek gently.
As Kellan walks away, he turns around and looks at Ryder with warm, sorrowful eyes. “She's no threat to us.”
“Go home, Kellan!”
By the time I can stand on my own two feet, Kellan's already out of sight.
Chapter 4

The last thing I wanted do right now is to have a conversation with Ryder. I'd rather stick pins in my eyes and cut out my tongue than speak to him. But here we are, in the middle of the night.
“Look, I'm really tired and a little pissed off with you and your friends. So just say what you got to say and leave me alone.”
Hopefully, he'll never have to speak to me again. “What happened to you last night?”
I should have moved when I had the chance because right now, my boobs are getting to know his chest really well.
“Absolutely nothing. And anyway, it's not like I owe you an explanation.”
Ryder cages me in with both of his hands on either side of my head. “You think I didn't see you inside that diner? We all did! So I need to know what happened to you last night.”
“Why is it so important for you to know?” I duck underneath his arm, and start walking.
“Alice! You need to listen to me.”
Before I know it, Ryder grabs my wrist and turns me around to face him. “You may not believe me, but I'm trying to help you.” “Help me!?”
“I'm trying to help you understand what you're about to go through.”
“And what would that be?” I take my hand from his hold, and place my hands on my hips in expectation of his answer.
“You might think I'm joking, but trust me I'm not.” Ryder turns his back on me, places his hands in his pockets and sighs in defeat. “In a few days, you'll go through the change.”
I frown. “The change?”
“Very soon, you'll experience the change. The change of becoming a wolf.”
A what?
I look at him in confusion, then burst out laughing.
He turns around and looks at me, his nostrils flaring “Stop laughing. This is not a joke. I don't joke about things like this. By the look of things, it's going to happen pretty soon.”
Surely he doesn't mean that I'm actually going to turn into a wolf because that's just crazy.
I roll my eyes, “Okay, I'll play along. What happens during this change?”
“Pain. A lot of pain.”
I sigh, “I've been in pain before you know.”
“Not this kind of pain. You'll start sweating a lot and you're gonna feel really hot. You'll also start to feel nauseous and if I remember correctly a headache too. Just think of it as a bad fever because that's not the worst part.”
I scoff. “What could possibly be worse than turning into a monster?”
He ignores my question and continues. “Your body is gonna feel like it's going to explode, and the last thing you want to do is fight it. Your body's telling you that the wolf inside of you is ready to take over, and if you fight it the first time, you're most likely to not survive the next change. So, whatever you do, don't fight it.”
“How do you know all of this? Are you a wolf?” Ryder merely shrugs. “We all are.”
“Who's we?”
Ryder doesn't answer me. He only gives me this knowing look that gives me the realization that I need to know what he means by his expression.
“You're saying that Bane, Silver and Kellan are wolves? Come on, be serious?”
“You think I'd be helping you if you weren't becoming one of us? Your scent was all over that diner for any wolf to pick up on it.”
Ryder's hands are balled into fists as he stares at me with a dark evil glint in his eyes. I don't care if he's angry or frustrated with me. I just wanted to go home and forget this conversation ever happened.
I scoff in disbelief. “I'm not becoming one of you! This kind of thing just doesn't happen to people!”
“You what to know what happened to Mr Daniels!? How his body was found ripped to shreds in his own home!?”
I can't take this anymore, I do the only thing I can think of to block Ryder's voice. I cover my ears and pray that he stops.
“Stop it!”
I beg and beg for him to stop, but he only carries on. “What's going on out here?”
Not only has Ryder stopped shouting, but his whole body stiffens when he notices Terry standing with a flashlight pointed right at him. “He giving you trouble, Alice?”
I take my hands away from my ears and shake my head. “No, he was just leaving.”
Ryder looks back at with me desperation in his eyes, but I can't listen to another word he has to say.
“Goodnight Terry.” I walk away, leaving both men standing alone in the dark.
The walk to my home was surprisingly peaceful. There were no run-ins with Ryder nor an encounter with a wolf. Just me and the sounds of nature. I hear the blood-curdling screams of the wild fox and the loud belching of the red deer stags in the night.
I take the shortcut home and come across the clearing of the forest that stands between me and my home. I believe that many secrets are in this forest, but I feel no threat nor am I afraid to know what hides inside it.
As I stand at the clearing, I feel nothing but power. I've experienced the feeling of becoming close to death, and I couldn't feel more alive.
I dash through the forest and leap over the thin winding creeks and the slippery rocks. I dodge and zip past rotting oak trees and under lowered branches. Bugs zip in and out of my ears, humming and buzzing their little song. Green leaves, yellow leaves and red leaves scatter on the ground like a rainbow of rich, autumnal colours. Ahead, the forest trees get thinner.
I'm close to home.
As I draw closer, I see the old worn bridge that leads to the road opposite my home.
Home sweet home.
I live with my mother in a quiet residential area in a beautiful detached house. It's been the only home I've ever lived in, and there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be because of the silence and peacefulness the house provides. The house has a big garden with beautiful trees, plants and even a swimming pool. The house is pretty spacious for only the two of us, with two floors and a smaller third floor with big windows.
The gate is on the ground floor where the big hall communicates with two comfortable airy living rooms, a bathroom, and a modern large kitchen is placed in the heart of the house. One living room has a door that leads out to the terrace that overlooks the garden. On the first floor are four rooms which consist of two doubles and two singles with two bathrooms.
My mother sleeps in the main bedroom which has its own bathroom and her own balcony.
I walk across the road and reach the wraparound porch in front of the house, and turn the handle to see that it's locked.
Mum should be home by now.
I tap my knuckles on the pristine glass door, and wait for any sign of movement.
I tap again and wait a few minutes longer. Nothing.
I move to check underneath the doormat and see the lone silver key.
I guess she's not home.
I pick up the key and enter the house, “Mum? Are you home?”
Not once did she answer me when I called her. Maybe she had a date tonight?
I take the stairs down into the kitchen, and notice a piece of paper stuck on the refrigerator.
Alice,
Got called down to the hospital, Probably won't be home till morning, Supper is in the microwave
Love you, Mum x
I guess that adds up to where she is.
I open the microwave and groan in satisfaction when I smell the sweet aroma of the pepperoni pizza.
My mother knows me too well.
Before I change out of my clothes and into my nightwear, I reheat the pizza and grab myself a can of coke.
By the time I come down the stairs, I take the pizza and can over to the sofa in front of the TV, and download the season finale of Game of Thrones.
Again, questions rush inside my head.
What if what Ryder says is true? That I'm changing into one of the most dangerous predators known to humans?
Whatever happens to me, the last thing I want to do is hurt somebody. I'd never forgive myself if I did.
I come out of my trance to the opening theme of Game of Thrones when suddenly everything in the room starts to blur. I can't see anything.
I wipe my eyes with the palm of my hands to feel that my face is burning.
I hear my heart beating rapidly inside my chest, and I start to notice that I'm struggling to breathe properly.
I stand on my feet to work my way towards the bathroom when suddenly I feel a stabbing pain in my stomach. It was like my insides were being twisted and pulled.
I pull the bathroom door open and balance myself on the sink.
I look in the mirror to see myself completely drenched in sweat.
Oh no...It's happening! What do I do!?
My head starts to throb as the pain in my stomach becomes too excruciating to cope with.
The more I try to stop the agonizing pain, I feel the most intense agony searing into my lower back, and all I can do is scream.
The pain becomes worse whenever I try to fight it, and straight away I feel nausea creeping up my throat. I double over and vomit violently to see black liquid coating the edges of the toilet.
I lose count of the amounts of time I vomit, but I refuse to stop fighting.
I refuse to change.
I don't care how long the pain takes, I won't give in to the change.
After what feels like intense hours, I sigh in relief as I rest my cheekbone on the cold surface of the toilet. My vision was starting to clear ever so slowly. The pain in my stomach, and lower back have subsided, and I can finally breathe again. My heart beats to its normal two-beat rhythm, and my head stops throbbing.
With unsteady legs, I get up from the position on the toilet and clean the bathroom from top to bottom.
After I finish cleaning, I sit on the floor and promise myself to only rest my eyes for a couple of minutes.
I don't hear the door open, nor do I hear my mother calling my name several times. She finds me exactly as I am sitting on the floor with my head resting on the toilet. I open my eyes and look at her.
“Alice honey, what are you doing on the floor?” She looks at me with worry in her eyes.
She stands by the bathroom door in her pink scrubs, holding her black knitted cardigan in her arms.
“I got sick.”
My mother kneels down on the floor in front of me and places her hand on my forehead.
“Did you catch a fever or something?”
“Yeah, maybe.”
'Right, well I think you should rest and drink plenty of water, and I'll call the doctor tomorrow if you want before I go to work, okay honey? No school for you tomorrow.”
She kisses me on the forehead and helps me slowly off the floor.
“How was work?” I follow my mother into the kitchen, and sit on the bar stool as she turns off the TV.
I've missed Game of Thrones. Again.
“Work was a little hectic but I'm happy to be home. Everything okay in school?”' She brings the uneaten pizza, and the unopened can of coke, into the kitchen and sets them on the counter.
“School was okay I guess. We have a new English teacher.”
“A new teacher? What happened to Mr. Daniels?” “I don't know. Maybe he quit?”
I don't know why I didn't tell my mother about Mr. Daniels, but I don't think telling her that he was supposedly found ripped to shreds in his home a good idea.
Who knows? Maybe Ryder only told me that to scare me?
“Well that's a shame. He was such a good teacher and he adored you.”
“I know, but.” I shrug my shoulders and stand to give my mother a hug. “Goodnight mom.”
She squeezes me tightly as she kisses the top of my head. “Goodnight honey. I love you.”
“Love you too.”
I walk up the stairs into my bedroom and lean my head against the door.
I actually did it, I did not change into a wolf.
I laugh hysterically to myself, feeling a great amount of triumph.
My body feels incredibly weak and drained after the events of last night and tonight, but at least the vomiting has stopped.
A part of me feels relieved that I won't have to face Ryder tomorrow, but the other part of me wants to tell him what happened here tonight.
He did tell me though that if I fought the change the first time, I'm less likely to survive the next change.
Chapter 5

Early the next morning, I wake up to my mother asking me if she needs to phone the doctor for me, but I decide to go back to sleep when I tell her that I was feeling better.
She kissed me goodbye and left for work soon after.
I don't wake up till late afternoon and when I do, I wake up to see five missed calls from Sam.
Great.
I sit up and dial her phone number, she answers immediately.
“Fucking finally! She's alive!” I hear her laughing on the other end.
“Very funny Sam.” I get up from the bed and walk downstairs into the kitchen to prepare myself breakfast.
“I'm sorry, I just wanted to know where my partner in crime was.”
“I'm at home. Didn't feel well last night.”
I open the cupboard, grab the loaf of bread and put one in the toaster.
“Did you get sick or something?”
“Yeah and guess what, mum found me on the edge of the toilet seat. She told me to stay home and sleep it off.”
“Okay your mum sucks for telling you that, but I guess if you aren't feeling well, then the best place for you to be is at home.”
“I guess, but I'm totally feeling fine right now. How's school?”
I hear nothing but silence on the other end. “Sam?” I warm up the kettle, take the toast out of the toaster and start spreading the butter.
I look to see if she accidentally pressed the end call button, but call her name again when I see that she hasn't. “Sam?”
“Ryder keeps staring at me and it's really creepy.” She whispers into the phone.
“What do you mean?” I grab myself a mug from the cupboard, make myself a cup of tea and sit down on the brown leather sofa.
“Well I'm sitting next to Alex who sits at the back of the class because he knows all the answers, and I don't know why but Ryder keeps looking at me.”
“Well, maybe he fancies you?” I question her but I only mean it as a joke.
“Cut the crap Alice. We both know that's not true.” Sam spits in disgust.
“How would you know?”
“Because he couldn't take his eyes off you at the diner.”
Yeah for all the wrong reasons!
“Look, just ask him why he's staring at you. It's not like he's going to bite.” I stifle a giggle.
If only she knew.
Sam groans. “Yeah, I'd rather not do that. Look I gotta go. Mr Jackson just came in.'
“Alright, have fun in Math.”
“Fuck you, I'll see you after school.” “Okay, see you soon.”
When I end the call, I look around the house and wonder what to do in the spare time that I have before Sam comes over.
I look up at the clock to see that it's 12:30, school finishes at 3:30.
I decide to make Sam proud and watch the season finale of Game of Thrones.
As the opening credits start, I can't help but feel sad that another season has come to its end. It makes me think back to when Sam and I met when we started out as freshmen. We were seated next to each other in our English class when Mr. Daniels told us to introduce ourselves and share to each other which one character in the whole world we wanted to be. When Sam told me who she wanted to be, she instantly became my best friend because she wanted to be Arya Stark. It was one of the happiest moments of my life because I wanted to be Daenerys Targaryen; The Mother of Dragons herself. We spent our first day as freshman talking about Game of Thrones, and we've been best friends ever since.
As I watch the show and see Arya Stark training with The Waif in the House of Black and White, all I can see is Sam. A long stern face, grey eyes and short brown hair.
Skinny but athletic. Where Arya gets mistaken for looking like a boy, Sam ignores the attention from the boys in our school. She can't think of anything worse than dating a guy from high school.
When the end credits of the show roll on the black screen, all I can think about is how I'm going to cope without having this show to watch every Sunday. Maybe I should start watching something like Prison Break or True Blood? True Blood has wolves in it so I'm not gonna watch that, and Prison Break?
Maybe I'll consider it.
I look again at the clock to see that it's 2:30.
An hour till Sam gets here!
I decide to put on a blue flannel shirt and some denim shorts leaving my feet bare. With only a few minutes to spare, I wash and dry the dishes, mop and hoover the floor and wipe down all the surfaces in the house.
By the time I put the hoover and mop in the storage closet, I hear a knock on the door.
I walk casually to it, open it to find Sam looking miserable at me.
“What's with the long face?”
She rushes past me and face-plants into the sofa. “I just had to endure the whole day with creepy stares coming from Ryder and his stupid gang all day!”
I laugh softly and move to sit in front of her on the coffee table.
“Did you ask him why he was staring at you?”
She turns her head to look at me and shakes her head. “Nope. He freaks me out, and it wasn't just him staring, it was all of them.”
I can only shrug. “I don't know what to say.”
Sam frowns. “Do you think maybe they were trying to lip read me?”
“What makes you think that?”
“Well, when I was sitting in the cafeteria, they were all staring at me like they were waiting for something. And then again in Math, I was talking to you on the phone and Ryder would not stop looking at me, and he doesn't even have Math!”
Maybe I should tell Sam about what happened last night at the diner, I want to involve her in on what goes on in my life.
“Maybe they were staring because they kind of ambushed me last night after work.”
She shrieks, “What!?”
“I was ambushed by the four of them after work except for Kellan, he stayed out of the confrontation part, but the rest of them interrogated me about the night I was bitten.”
Sam moves to lie on her side with a confused expression on her face. “Why would they want to know about what happened to you that night?”
Before I can respond to her question, I hear a knock on the door and see Sam frowning at me.
“Are you expecting someone?” “No, just you.”
We both look towards the door and wait.
“Should I go answer it?” I ask. “Maybe it's someone for my mum?”
“Leave it.” Sam grabs the remote off the coffee table and turns on the TV.
“Sam, I can't just leave whoever's out there waiting. I'll be right back.”
I hear Sam murmur something under her breath, but it's too quiet for me to hear what she said.
I walk briskly to the front door and can't believe my eyes who I see on the other side. I stare at him open-mouthed.
“Didn't think I'd find you?” Ryder's hip leans against the door jamb.
I step outside and shut the door behind me.
“What the hell are you doing here!?” I spit. “How did you find me!?”
“I came over to apologize about last night.” “How did you find me!?”' I repeat.
'You know the answer to that question. Besides, I had to check on you.” He frowns and shakes his head, “Something's wrong with your scent.”
“What do you mean?”
“It's different. Like it's receding.”
He looks at me in confusion. “Did something happen to you last night, Alice?”
I don't say a word.
He backs me up against the wall next to the door and places his palm next to my face. “I won't ask you again. If something happened to you then I need to know.”
I bite my lip and look away from him. “I think you better leave.”
“I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what happened.”
