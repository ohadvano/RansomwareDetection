
Tolinase, Diabinese or Dymelor are oral medicines which many Type 2 diabetics take.

These medicines are not insulin, but drugs that stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin.

There are many natural ways to stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin without taking

the drugs which have side effects.



NATURAL WAYS TO HELP

Diet - There is not a known remedy that wil cure diabetes without a reformation

along the lines that caused it. The number one dietary consideration for diabetes must be

a strict vegetarian, low calorie, alkaline diet of high quality natural foods. Plenty of whole

grains, bran and oatmeal are very beneficial in diabetes, as wel as raw vegetables of al

kinds - red cabbage, cauliflower, watercress, brussel sprouts, okra, cucumbers, onions,

etc. A big emphasis needs to be placed on raw foods as they stimulate the pancreas and

increase insulin production. Green beans and cucumber juice contain a hormone needed

by the cel s of the pancreas in order to produce insulin. No table sugar should be used.

When sugar is eaten and absorbed into the blood stream, it requires insulin and a trace

element cal ed chromium to move the sugar from the blood stream into the cel s where it

can be burned for energy. In the diabetic the insulin is missing. Therefore sugar piles up in

the blood stream and cannot move into the cel . When insulin is given, the sugar is able to

move into the cel and the sugar level wil drop in the blood stream. If chromium is missing,

the blood sugar wil rise again, for the sugar is stil not able to enter the cel . Chromium is

available in many natural foods (especial y whole grains), but most of it is removed when

foods are refined. The average American diet is lacking in chromium. At birth we have a

good supply of chromium, but as we get older we gradual y lose it if we do not eat

properly. Many older individuals are deficient in chromium. Why is this happening? When

refined sugar is eaten, it requires chromium to be utilized. If none is taken in with food,

chromium from the body stores, if available, has to be used. Thus chromium is gradual y

depleted and sickness occurs.



What about fresh fruits, as they contain sugar? Fresh fruits of al kinds are excel ent

for the diabetic.(1) The sugar in fresh fruit is fructose sugar and is very different from the

refined table sugar (which is sucrose sugar). When we eat sugar or starch our body

breaks it down into simple sugar and the blood then carries it to the cel s of the body. For

this simple sugar to enter the cel s it needs insulin and chromium, but if you have eaten

only fructose sugar (the good kind that is found only in fresh fruits), no insulin is needed

for the sugar to enter the cel s. This is why a diabetic can eat al the fresh fruit desired, but

no canned or frozen fruit juices (even if they are supposedly al natural). Al of these are

refined; they have been heated (even the frozen ones) and are hard for a diabetic to

assimilate.

Use no free fats - only natural fats as found in avocados, nuts, etc. Recent studies

show excess fat intake can decrease the number of receptors and/or deactivate them.

This results in the gradual build up of sugar in the bloodstream. Dr. James Anderson, one

of the most respected authorities on diabetes in the world, did a study with Dr. Kiehm.

They took thirteen diabetics off the 34 percent fat, 23 percent protein diet prescribed by

the American Diabetes Association and fed them a 9 percent fat diet of mostly natural high



100

fiber, starchy foods. Blood sugar levels were significantly lowered in al thirteen. Al five

patients taking oral drugs and four of the eight patients taking insulin were able to

discontinue their medication completely. (2)



Diabetics should discontinue the use of baking powder or soda, as these decrease

the activity of the pancreatic juices, which are used in the body to digest protein, fats and

carbohydrates. The pancreas is one of the most important organs of digestion.



Fasting is usual y not advisable for diabetics. Avoid al mental nervous stresses and

strains. Avoid constipation; the bowels must be kept loose with at least three good

eliminations every day. This is imperative to improved health.





Herb Tea - Tea, made from any one of the fol owing herbs is beneficial: raspberry

leaves, red root or dandelion root. Mix one tsp. of herb per 8 oz. of distil ed water. Let

steep for 20 minutes or longer. Drink three cups daily.





Exercise - Exercise wil lower the blood sugar and enable the diabetic to require

less insulin.(3) Deep breathing and lots of exercise of hard physical labor wil help keep the

fire of the metabolic processes burning fast, and this wil diminish the need for insulin.



Sunlight - The effect of direct sunlight on the body's sugar metabolism paral els

that of insulin. Sunlight facilitates the absorption of glucose into the cel s of the body and

stimulates the body to convert its blood sugar (glucose) into stored sugar (glycogen).(4)

This is minimal in a normal individual but dramatic in diabetics. A diabetic must gradual y

expose his body to the sunlight. Diabetics who choose to sunbathe should always keep in

touch with their physician as their insulin dosage wil have to be decreased.

In conclusion, diabetes is unknown in countries where people can't afford to

overeat. Americans may be the richest people in the world, but they are also one of the

sickest. In America, a new diabetic is discovered every 50 seconds. I want to encourage

al to eat in moderation, only those things that are wholesome and natural.

ELECTRICAL CURRENTS





Our body runs on electricity. An electrocardiogram wil record the electrical activity

of the heart. An electroencephalograph records the electrical activity of the brain. Today

we know the human body runs on electrical energy.

Very few health professionals have any information on the electrical currents in the

body and how they can be altered to either produce good or bad results in the human

body.



WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?

No one real y knows what electricity is. We only partial y know how to use it and

how it works. This definition of electricity is given in Taber's Cyclopedic Medica Dictionary;

"A form of energy that exhibits magnetic, chemical, mechanical and thermal effects.

Electricity is formed from the interactions of positive and negative charges." The medical

field today uses electricity on the body. Three examples of this are found in electro

hemostasis, which uses high frequency current to stop bleeding; electroconvulsive

therapy, the use of electrical shock to produce convulsions; and electro analygesia, using

low intensity electrical currents to bring relief from pain. These forms of electrical

treatments may cause harm to the body, as they disturb the natural circulation of electrical

currents. Did you know that cancer cel s are weaker than normal cel s, and that cancer

cel s have a different electrical frequency than normal cel s?



NATURAL WAYS OF KEEPING THE BODYâ€™S ELECTRICAL CURRENTS

IN BALANCE



I'm sure, as research in this area goes on, more natural ways to keep the body's

electrical currents in balance wil be found. Two natural ways that I'm aware of are

breathing fresh outside air, and having the body in contact with the soil.





102





BREATHING FRESH AIR



Al air contains electricity. Air can be either positively charged or negatively charged.

Negatively charged air, which is the kind that is beneficial to us, is found in the open air,

especial y in the mountains or the country; these are examples of air

that has been undisturbed by pol ution. The air with the most negative

ions in it is ocean air, or the air near a river or waterfal , and the air just

after a rainstorm. Positively charged air is not beneficial to us and is

the air found inside a closed room. Al electrical appliances and

heating and air conditioning systems use up good negative ions and

give off bad positive ions. This is especial y true of TV's, computers,

microwaves and fluorescent lights. The air we exhale is also positively

charged.



As the number of positive ions increases, with a corresponding

decrease in negative ions, one may feel such adverse effects as headaches, nasal

obstruction, hoarseness, fatigue, dry throat and dizziness. Negatively charged air, on the

other hand, produces a feeling of exhilaration and wel -being. Negatively charged air also

has been shown to decrease the respiration rate and lower blood pressure, while

positively charged air has just the opposite effect. (1)



There are over 3,000 - 4,000 negative ions in one cubic centimeter of mountain air,

but only 100 negative ions in one cubic centimeter of air in an office building at the end of

an eight hour day. Thus, we can readily see that to keep our body's electrical currents high

in negative ions, and thus experience good health, we need a continuous supply of fresh

outdoor air. "The stomach, liver, lungs and brain are suffering for the want of deep, ful

inspirations of air, which would electrify the blood and impart to it a bright, lively color, and

which alone can keep it pure, giving tone and vigor to every part of the living machinery".

(2)



BODY CONTACT WITH THE SOIL



To help keep our body's electrical frequency correct, we should spend some time

outside each day working with the soil or standing (or walking) with our bare feet in direct

contact with the earth. Our body and the earth are both electrical; and you do not get an

electrical exchange with the earth when you are wearing shoes, as the soles insulate you

from the ground. Just a short time, (10 minutes min.) each day wil greatly benefit a

person. This exercise is especial y true for those who are nervous or emotional y

disturbed.



CONCLUSION



The more knowledge man acquires the more he realizes how little he actual y

knows. We stil have much to learn about the electrical currents that control the human

body. This is an area that has been sadly neglected in the health field and I hope that as

time goes on we wil understand more ful y the good and bad effects of electricity on the

body.

ELIMINATION





This is a subject that everyone talks about and usual y suffer bad experiences

about sooner or later in life. Over 80 mil ion Americans suffer from bowel problems.

Cancer is the second major cause of death in the United States and of al cancer deaths,

cancer of the colon ranks second only to lung cancer.



Toxic bowel waste matter within our body is a big factor in diseases of al types. A

person who eats 3 meals a day should have three bowel movements a day. If a person

eats two meals a day, then they should have two bowel movements a day. One should

eliminate the residue of each meal 15 to 18 hours after eating. When a person goes two or

more days without an elimination, al that waste is putrefying in the body and being

reabsorbed through the colon wal s. The body is thus being poisoned from within. It would

be the same as keeping some food in a covered garbage can for two days in a

temperature slightly above 98.6 degrees,



CAUSES





The major causes of constipation are poor diet, inadequate intake of water, lack of

physical exercise, emotional or mental distress, and the use of medications. Low Fiber

Diet - Most foods that are eaten today are highly refined and lacking in fiber and bulk.

Good health and regular eliminations depend on a lot of fiber. Unrefined grains, nuts,

legumes, fruits and vegetables are high in fiber.



All types of cheeses are the most constipating foods one can eat.



Fiber should be cal ed the staff of life. When people change from a soft diet (which

are foods lacking in fiber and bulk), to wholesome natural unrefined foods that take time to

chew, it is amazing how much better they feel in a short period of time. They themselves

are amazed at how much more stamina and strength they have. Fewer people would

experience constipation, if they would eat more foods containing fiber. Processed,

devitalized foods are lacking in fiber and bulk. They tend to be dry, sticky and pasty. They

have a tendency to stick to the insides of the colon like glue and are difficult to eliminate.

Dr. J. N. Morris states that a lack of fiber in the diet may be one of the major causes of

coronary thrombosis (blockage of the coronary arteries). (1)

Both British and South African medical scientists strongly insist that insufficient

numbers of bowel movements and too little fiber and bulk in the feces may often explain

the existence of gal bladder disorder, heart problems, varicose veins, appendicitis, clotting

in deep veins, hiatal hernia, diverticulosis, arthritis and cancer of the colon. This complete

turnaround in medical orientation comes from professional and respected surgeons and

biochemists.(2)

After a tremendous amount of research work done by the Senate Select Committee

on Nutrition and Human Needs, the fol owing conclusion was reported. They

recommended a 25 percent reduction in the consumption of fat, and a 25 percent increase

in carbohydrates (particularly in the form of whole grains, fruits and vegetables). the



104

committee cited the relationship between the current fat rich, fiber deficient American diet,

and the high risk of cancer as wel as heart ailments and other diseases.



Water - One should drink a minimum of two quarts of distil ed water daily. If you are

overweight or doing hard physical work then you need more than 2 quarts. When we do

not drink enough water our body wil absorb water from the fecal matter that is in our

colon. This in turn makes the fecal matter hard, which causes constipation. Our bodies

use much more water than we realize. Each day we lose one and one half glasses of

water, through breathing alone. Over a quart a day is lost in urine; and every time we blink

our eyes, our body loses some water. Of course, our body loses large amounts of water

through perspiration.

Exercise - Exercise wil help one to have regular eliminations. You have six

hundred thirty three muscles, every one of which needs to be used. If we do not use our

muscles, they lose their tone, strength and flexibility. Exercise doesn't have to be painful.

There are hundreds of ways to exercise the human body. The exercise having the most

benefit is walking and no special equipment is required, except a good pair of shoes.

Stress - Do you remember a time when you were enjoying a good meal with

friends and you received a phone cal giving you terrible news? You suddenly lost your

appetite and you even felt light headed and sick. The relation that exists between the

mind, and the body is very intimate. When one is affected the other sympathizes. Stress

today is one of the causes of poor digestion, ulcers and constipation. Grief, anxiety,

discontent, remorse, guilt, distrust, or other emotions, al tend to break down the life

forces. Isaiah 26:3 gives us the answer to this problem.

Medications - Medications can cause many problems with the bowel. The side

effects of many medications cause constipation for many physiological reasons.

Antibiotics, such as penicil in and sulfa can completely eliminate the favorable intestinal

flora, leaving the opportunity for reinfestation by harmful bacteria and viruses.

Laxatives - Laxatives are irritating to the bowel and are dangerous. Today there

are more than 45,000 laxative and cathartic medications being manufactured and used in

America. These substances, in order to evacuate the colon, are essential y poisons and

irritants. The poisoned intestinal tract tries to evacuate the offending substance as quickly

as possible and pushes everything out. Often times, these harsh poisonous substances

are absorbed through the lymph and blood vessels and find their way to al parts of the

body affecting the liver, kidneys, and other vital areas. Many of these medications can

become addicting, and can destroy the ability of the bowel to eliminate natural y.



HERBS

Herbs can be used successful y and safely for constipation. One of the best herbs

for constipation is Cascara Sagrada. Mix four teaspoonfuls in a quart of distil ed water

(that was boiling and just taken off the stove). Let it steep for one hour, then drink one or

two cupfuls one hour before meals or on an empty stomach.

To get wel and stay wel , our bodies have to be clean on the inside as wel as the

outside. If you wil eat natural unrefined foods, drink plenty of pure water, gets proper

exercise, stay away from medications, and al ow God to handle the stress in your life, you

should not have any problems with proper elimination.

FASTING



Fasting is the oldest therapeutic method known to man. Even before the advent of

the healing arts, man instinctively stopped eating when feeling il and abstained from food

until his health was restored. Perhaps he learned this from animals, which always fast

when not feeling wel

There is much said throughout the entire Bible about fasting. God instituted fasting

for both spiritual and physical blessings. Fasting has two purposes - the up building of the

body and the spiritual up building of the soul. As fasting improves physical health, it also

improves mental health causing the mind to be open to a greater extent to the leading and

impressions of the Holy Spirit.

I am thoroughly convinced that a great many people eat too much (over 60% of al

Americans are overweight). Many eat food that does not give them proper nourishment;

they eat food that is highly refined and unwholesome. This food wil gradual y, over a

period of time, bring upon them sickness and death.

Many scientific studies are now being made around the world, particularly in Europe, to

determine the therapeutic effects of fasting. The Karalinska Institute in Stockholm, a world

famous medical research institution, has made clinical studies of fasting under Drs. P.

Reizenstein and J. Kel berg. These studies demonstrated that fasting has a definite

beneficial healing effect.



WATER FAST VS. JUICE FAST VS. FRUIT & VEGETABLE FAST

There are persons who advocate long fasts for health, but I discourage long water

fasts as they can be quite harmful to the body. However, a prolonged fresh fruit and

vegetable fast I highly recommend. Proper fasting can do a lot in helping with one's health;

but improper fasting can be harmful to one's health. A normal person can fast one to three

days on only distil ed water without any injury and it wil be quite beneficial both spiritual y

and physical y to one's health. If you fast on water only for more than three days, then you

are living on the broken down tissues in your body which produces an acid reaction. This

thickens the blood; and with a high concentration of poisons in the bloodstream, puts a

burden on the heart, arteries, kidneys, liver, lungs, etc.

We can help this cleansing process by eating lots of fresh raw vegetables and fruits

as most are alkaline forming and wil increase the healing effect of fasting as elimination of

uric acid and other inorganic acids wil be accelerated. The vitamins, minerals, enzymes

and trace elements of raw vegetables and fruits are important in supplying needed

elements for the body's own healing.

Fasting in Europe is practiced on a grand scale. There are hundreds of clinics in

Germany alone where fasting is a number one method of healing. Al of them use juice

fasting exclusively. I believe that juice fasting is preferable to water fasting, but that the

whole fruit or vegetable fast is preferable to a juice fast. Which is more natural, the orange

or orange juice? He would have put a lid on top of the orange. When you use juice

instead of the whole food, while you are fasting, you wil have problems with elimination as

there is no fiber or bulk in juice.





106

FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLESS: FAST CLEANSES THE BODY

It is wel to know the process your body goes through in the course of a fast. The

first three days are usual y the most difficult in terms of hunger pains. By the fourth day the

hunger pains are beginning to subside, though you wil have feelings of weakness and

occasional dizziness. During a prolonged fast (after the first three days) your body wil live

on its own substance. When it is deprived of needed nutrition such as proteins and fats, it

wil burn and digest its own tissues. But your body wil not do it indiscriminately -and here

lies the secret of the effectiveness of fasting -your body wil first decompose and burn

those cel s and tissues which are diseased, damaged, aged, or dead.



In fasting, your body feeds itself on the most impure and inferior materials such as

tumors, abscesses, fat deposits, etc. Dr. Otto Buchanan, M.D. (one of the greatest fasting

authorities in the world) cal s fasting -very pertinently - a "refuse disposal", a "burning of

rubbish". During fasting, while the old cel s and diseased tissues are decomposed and

burned, the building of new healthy cel s is speeded up. This eliminative process is

evidenced by some of the fol owing typical symptoms: offensive breath, dark urine, skin

eruptions, excessive perspiration, catarrhal eliminations of mucus, and headaches. Do not

be disturbed by those symptoms; rather, be grateful for the increased health and wel -

being that wil result.

By the ninth or tenth day of a longer fast, the body wil normal y have eliminated the

bulk of toxic poisons and you wil start feeling great. Your sense of concentration wil be

greater, and you wil feel as if you could continue fasting indefinitely as you are not

hungry. Your fast can last as long as you like (it could go on for weeks as it depends upon

how much fresh fruit and vegetables you are eating), but it must end when your hunger

pains return. This is the signal that the body has used up al its excess reserves. The fast

should be broken at this time.





ADDITIONAL TIPS ON FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLE FAST

Do not drink with meals, and do not mix fruits and vegetables at the same meal. Eat

only fresh fruits and vegetables, nothing cooked or dried. Eat no more than twice a day at

a regular time each day, and nothing between meals, except water or herb tea. One must

drink a minimum of two quarts of distil ed water daily; more is better. Bathing once or twice

daily is also beneficial, as one third of al body impurities and wastes are eliminated

through the skin. Do lots of deep breathing of outside air. Red clover tea is a very good

herb to take while one is on a fast. It is an excel ent blood purifier and wil help your body

detoxify. Drink it as often as you like.



107





FEVERS





The normal temperature taken oral y is 98.6Â° F.

However, it may be within the range of normal if it is one

degree above or two degrees below this value. When an

individual comes down with a fever, their body is trying to tel

them something is wrong.



Fever happens to be a defense strategy employed by

the body that helps to destroy bacteria and viruses that have

gotten out of hand. Bacteria and viral microbes live normal y

and natural y inside of human beings. They co-exist with us,

around us and inside us, and when our body's immune

system is working properly, these microbes cause us little

concern. In fact, many scientists have demonstrated that

these microbes are often important to our inner functioning

and biochemical existence. Our body's own innate ability to

keep bacteria and viruses in check inside of us via our immune system is the best way to

stay wel . Our bodies contain over seventy thousand tril ion cel s that al make their own

chemicals. They make them in the right quantities and there are no il side effects. When a

person does get a fever it is the body's natural way of destroying bacteria and viruses.

These bacteria and viruses find it extremely difficult to sustain their existence in higher

temperature ranges, and so the body's immune system causes the fever to kil off the

microbes.



Thus, when our body has a fever, it is not good to lower the fever as this wil hinder

the body from doing its job of getting rid of the problems causing the fever.

What we need to do is help our body by raising our temperature. Many years ago

when someone had a fever, they would put them to bee cover them up with lots of

blankets, and eve put hot water bottles on their feet. They would also give the individual

large amounts of put soft water to drink. After a time the fever would break and the person

was on their way to recovery.



ISN'T TOO HIGH A FEVER DANGEROUS?



Conventional medicine spends most of its time treating symptoms or signs of

disease instead of treating the disease. For example, when one has a fever and goes to

the doctor h is given medication, such as aspirin, to lower the fever. By lowering the fever

by chemical y introducing a drug, the medical profession is not treating the disease but

instead only addressing the symptom. Medicine as a profession ha taught us that it is

beneficial to lower the fever whereas, in reality, this wil cause harm to the body. By

lowering the fever artificial y this prevents the immune system from doing the job is

supposed to do, thus the person gets sicker 2 the microbes increase.



As long as the temperature is below 105Â° F, it wil not cause harm or brain damage

to normal person. When I worked at a hospital in Central America we had patients come in

with malaria who had high temperatures and it didnâ€™t cause brain damage.



108





IS THERE A NATURAL WAY TO LOWER A FEVER?

If a person's temperature goes over 105Â° make sure they are drinking plenty of

water. If they are drinking the water and their temperature is stil over 105Â° F. then the best

way to lower the fever is by putting them into a ful bath tub of water that is around 98Â° -

100Â° F. Never put them into ice water or cold water. This wil cause most of the blood from

the legs and arms to go to the trunk of the body and wil hinder circulation and be

detrimental.



WHAT ELSE SHOULD BE DONE FOR A HIGH FEVER?

As long as the fever is below 105Â° F. let it take its course. Give plenty of water as

mentioned earlier. If they want to eat give them only fresh fruit. Make sure they are

comfortable and in quiet surroundings. Be sure they have plenty of fresh air and sunshine,

and that they bathe everyday. Most fevers are of a rather short duration, but occasional y

they can last for a longer period of time. The human body is the greatest doctor alive.

When one has a fever, help the fever to do its job natural y.

FOODS - ACID AND ALKALINE





Al food, as they are digested or burned, leave an ash in the body. This ash can be

neutral, acid or alkaline, depending on the mineral composition of the food. The acid ash

(acidosis) results when there is a depletion of the alkaline ash. In the healing of sickness,

the higher the ratio of alkaline forming foods in the diet, the faster wil be the recovery.

Alkalis neutralize the acids. Al the minerals that make up the red blood cel s and the blood

plasma are alkaline, except for chlorine which is acid. There are other important fluids in

the body which are alkaline. Some of these are saliva, bile, tears, lymph, joint lubricant,

muscle lubricant, colon secretion and pancreatic juice. None of the alkaline juices are

body wastes, though the bile contains waste. Some body fluids that are acidic are urine,

perspiration, fluid emitted during expiration, fatigue wastes and gastric juice. Al of these

fluids are body wastes except for the gastric juice, which is used for digestion. It is

important to realize that the body fluids which contribute to the life processes are al

alkaline except the gastric juice and that the waste fluids are al acid. The acid products

must be eliminated because the healthy state of the body is one of alkalinity. If the tissues

of the body become acid to the slightest degree, serious il ness occurs and death can

result.

The degree of acidity or alkalinity of a substance is expressed in pH values, the "p"

indicates the potency, while the "H" is for hydrogen ions which is the name the chemist

gives to the particular element constituting the acid. The scale ranges from 0 (acid) to 14

(alkaline), with 7 being neutral, neither acid nor alkaline.

Normal blood is slightly alkaline, just above neutral, having a pH of 7.35. If the pH

of a person's blood reaches higher than 7.8 or fal s below 7.22, immediate death occurs. A

condition known as acidosis occurs when the pH of the blood drops below 7.35. If the

blood rises above the normal 7.35, alkalosis exists and grows more severe, until death

occurs when the pH reaches 7.8. This provides a variable range of only about .6 of a

degree. Disease occurs any time the blood does not have a normal pH of 7.35.

The more acid the fluids and tissues of the body become the more subject they are

to the growth of bacteria and germs, and the less able they are to combat them. It is now

known that acid-forming foods increase the excretion of calcium and phosphorus from the

body (causing osteoporosis) and that alkaline-forming foods tend toward a greater

retention of these mineral salts in the body. Kidney stones are sometimes concentrations

of uric acid crystals which are more apt to form when the urine is too acidic. A more

alkaline urine tends to dissolve them. A burning sensation can develop when the urine

becomes very acidic. By drinking large amounts of distil ed water one can speed the

process of acid elimination through the pores and kidneys. The pH of urine can be

changed in just a few hours.

The skin is provided with approximately 1,500,000 sweat glands, excreting

perspiration, which is acidic. The lungs give off carbonic acid gas which is released as

carbon dioxide and water. The burning of food and oxygen in the body cel s produces this

gas which is taken by lymph and blood to the lungs to be exhaled.

More processes of life are aided by alkaline fluids than acid. Both are necessary.

Alkalis are continual y being consumed and the supply depleted. Since they are

continual y being consumed, there is the danger that the supply wil be exhausted. It is

very plain then, that if foods wil influence the alkalinity and acidity of the body we need to

eat abundantly of that which wil keep the alkalinity of the body high, and eat sparingly of

foods which wil increase its acidity. The ideal ratio according to Dr. Roger Berg, the

world's foremost authority on the relationship between the acid-alkaline ratio in the diet, is

about 80% alkaline producing foods and 20% acid producing foods. The correct pH

balance of our blood can be maintained by choosing careful y the foods one eats. Another

factor, which influences the correct balance, is the ability of the kidneys, skin pores and

lungs to eliminate acids. It is important that these organs function properly.

Harmful acids that we should avoid are: acetic acid found in vinegar; tannic acid

found in coffee, tea and cocoa; and benzoic acid found in food preservatives. Foods that

are acid in themselves such as citrus, when digested and assimilated by the body leave

an alkaline residue, while alkaline foods leave an acid residue. Therefore, we refer to the

foods as either acid forming, or alkaline forming.

Studies have also confirmed that rest, exercise, fresh air, laughter and love are

alkalizers of the body; selfishness, anger, worry and hatred are acidifiers of the body.

FRESH FOOD IS BEST



In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve ate only fresh

fruits, nuts and grains. Eve didn't use a stove or microwave to

prepare Adam's meals. For one to have good health, a

minimum of 50% of our daily food intake should be raw foods.

Raw food is live food; cooked food is dead food. Have you

noticed how few fresh raw fruits and vegetables the average

person consumes?
