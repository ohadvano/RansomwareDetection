I get to my car, pick the right key and open the door when I hear my name being called several times. I ignore the voice and start getting into the car when a hand grabs onto my arm pulling me away from the car. I turn and stare directly into Ryder's eyes.
“Where do you think you're going?”
I remove Ryder's hand from my arm and move back to the car. “Away from here where I won't be interrogated like a bad person.”
Ryder's voice deepens. “Did Tom say something to you?”
I scoff. “What do you think we've been talking about for the past half hour? The weather?”
Ryder just looks at me. “Did he give you a hard time in there?”
“A hard time? He thinks...” I shake my head dumbfounded. “He thinks I'm somehow involved in the case because I knew the victims.”
“What?” Ryder looks at me in confusion. “Why would he think that you're involved?”
I point to myself. “You're asking me? I don't even know where I fit into this.”
