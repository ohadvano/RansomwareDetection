He merely shakes his head and murmurs. “You don't know shit.” He indicates for the door. “Shut the door on your way out but oh wait, I don't even have a fucking door after what your boyfriend did to it.” He walks away leaving me alone in the living area.
I stand there for quite some time thinking about what happened here today. A part of me feels relieved that I got to ask Max the questions that've been bothering me for quite some time, but the other part of me feels that I haven't really accomplished anything.
I know that Max didn't really cooperate much but his face said enough to make me realize that he's a liar, and he's not someone I can associate with anymore.
This was your last chance to prove that you could've been someone that I could trust, but you continued to lie. And for that, I won't be listening to another one of your lies.

There wasn't any other reason to stay longer in that house. Max had disappeared and he never even said goodbye, but I know now where we stand with each other. Our friendship was brief but no friendship has ever affected me the way it has been with Max in that short amount of time. I will be polite and civil whenever I see him again, but I hope he understands that we can longer be friends.
I expected to feel bad about losing a friend like Max, but as I walk to the car parked outside the house I feel relief more than anything. It was nice to have someone new being a part of our group, a person that didn't judge us for being who we were, but I hope Sam understands that what I've decided to do is the right thing for us.
I reach the car door and let myself in, Ryder watches my every move.
