I look inside my bag to see if I have everything only to realize that I don't have my pencil case. I reopen my locker when I hear Sam sigh.
“People still staring?”
“What? Oh, no just Ryder and his crew. They walk around here like they own the place, but seriously how does a guy even look that good?”
After I grab my pencil case, I shut my locker and look at my best friend, whose mouth is wide open.
“Sam! You're staring honey, and drooling.” I close her mouth, shove the pencil case in my bag and stare at them. Every single person moves to the side to make room for them to pass. You see, this gang does practically own the school, and if you hurt one of them, you hurt them all.
Everyone knows who they are and no one dares to try and talk to them or to even approach them. They walk side by side in a perfect line. Bane and Silver on the outside, with Kellan and Ryder in the middle.
Bane looks to be the most frightening one out of them all. He has an oval shaped face with small, blue piercing eyes. His mouth, full and firm with a constant sneer on his face. He has tanned skin with a warm, golden brown tint that accentuates his large muscular frame. His hair was thick, black and slicked down with both sides of his head shaved. Bane also had a black bushy beard decorating his face. It was hard sometimes to take him seriously with the beard because it kind of makes him look like a big old teddy bear, but if the rumors were true, you definitely shouldn't say that to his face, not unless you wanted to end up in A&E. He wears a plain white wife-beater that's low enough to show the hairs on his chest, and a long black necklace rests on his chest that looks like a triskelion. He wears black tight jeans with black ankle boots with a small heel.
I look over at Silver who walks on the far right corner and just blatantly stare at her. Every girl wants to be her, and every guy in this school wants to date her, but everyone knows that she's in love with Ryder. The way she looks and smiles at him with her perfect teeth and her perfect body. She has a heart-shaped face with pale, smooth skin and bright blue eyes. Her mouth is full and perfectly shaped which helps accentuates her pouty lips. Her long wild, black untamed hair rests on her left shoulder and hangs down by her waist. Her build small but muscular.
Rumours say that she kicked a jocks ass once after he slapped her ass. He left in an ambulance, and didn't return to school until the next month. No one ever touched her again. Not after that. She wears a black leather jacket that cuts to her waist, plain black shorts, and black thigh high boots.
