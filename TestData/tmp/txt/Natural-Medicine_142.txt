hemoglobin. A Vitamin C deficiency can cause scurvy, fatigue, loss of appetite, easy

bruising, easy bleeding, slow-healing wounds, loose teeth, and anemia. Vitamin C

supplements can be harmful. Excessive quantities reduce the pH of the urine to as low as

four, increasing the risks of kidney stones. It also wil interfere with purine metabolism,

increasing the risk of gout. Large doses of Vitamin C may also promote cancer(3). Some

natural food sources of Vitamin C are al fruits, and green, leafy vegetables. Carbon



177

monoxide destroys Vitamin C, so those who live in the cities should definitely eat extra

amounts of foods containing Vitamin C.



VITAMIN D (CALCIFEROL!, VIOSTEROID, ERGOSTEROL)

Vitamin D is an oil soluble vitamin, and it is stored in the body. It is known as the

sunshine vitamin because it is formed when the ultraviolet rays of the sun act on the skin

to produce Vitamin D, which is then absorbed into the body. Vitamin D is needed to

regulate the absorption of calcium and phosphorous. A Vitamin D deficiency leads to

rickets, a disease in which the bones do not form properly (knock knees, bow legs, etc.). It

wil also cause severe tooth decay, osteoporosis, muscular weakness, loss of appetite,

and loss of weight. The only natural source is sunshine. There is a limited amount of

Vitamin D in some animal products, which I do not consider a natural source, and would

not recommend.



VITAMIN E (TOCOPHEROL)

Vitamin E is fat soluble and is stored for long periods of time in the liver, fatty

tissues, heart, and muscles of the body. Many months of deprivation would be required to

deplete the body of Vitamin E. One of the important functions of Vitamin E is to aid in

carrying oxygen to the tissues. Vitamin E is also essential for the adequate absorption of

iron. Vitamin E keeps you looking younger, gives you endurance by supplying oxygen to

the body. It helps prevent and dissolve clotting of blood cel s. It prevents thick scar

formation external y, and accelerates the healing of wounds. It can lower blood pressure;

and aids in the prevention of miscarriages. A Vitamin E deficiency rarely occurs. It is

prevalent in nearly every food, Green plants, grains, nuts, legumes, various seeds, fruits,

and vegetables al contain Vitamin E.



VITAMIN K (MENADIONE)

Vitamin K is fat soluble and is stored in the body. This vitamin promotes proper

blood clotting, and helps to keep one from bleeding to death. Vitamin K deficiency wil

cause internal bleeding, hemorrhages, and excessive menstrual flow. Some natural food

sources of this vitamin are alfalfa, green leafy vegetables, tomatoes, and grains.

VITAMIN AND

MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS



Are vitamin and mineral supplements needed in the diet? Which ones are essential,

and how much should we take? The answer to these questions is quite simple: If our

creator would have wanted us to take Vitamin C, He would have created a tree that grew

Vitamin C pil s. Instead He created many different fruit trees, and the fruit contains the

Vitamin C our bodies need. The American people have been convinced that vitamins are

good for their health, and over 40% take supplemental vitamins every day.

Our actual need for vitamins and minerals has been greatly exaggerated. The

actual amount of vitamins the human body needs for one year is very smal . Every vitamin

and mineral necessary to the body can be found in the food we eat. There is a long list of

experts in the field of nutrition who are expressing grave concerns over the health threat

posed from taking vitamins and mineral supplements.

Dr. Myron Winick, director of the Institute of Human Nutrition at Columbia

University, indicates that some vitamins, long considered not harmful, are producing

medical problems including nerve damage, mild intestinal distress, and fatal liver damage.

(Los Angeles Times 12/30/83). Recent reports on excessive use of Vitamin B6 warns that

it can cause nerve damage. Symptoms include unsteady walking, numbness, or tingling in

the hands and feet. Microscopic analysis shows deterioration of nerve fibers in direct

proportion to the amount of B6 ingested. These and other neurological problems may

require months to recover from, and can be permanent.

According to an article in the Health Reporter by Robert McCarter, PhD, man-made

supplements are simply not what was intended for the human body. In the process of

extracting and fractionating elements, they are rendered worthless. Once removed and

isolated, vitamins lose their value. Technology exists that can create a grain of wheat in

the laboratory. Every needed chemical component can be duplicated and made into a

grain of wheat; but if it's put into the ground it wil not grow. Why? Because it is not natural.

Man cannot improve upon the natural way our Creator has given us to get our

vitamins and minerals. For example: there are several cautions against taking Vitamin C.

There are side effects. Vitamin C has an anti-Vitamin D effect. That means that when you

take extra Vitamin C, your body requires extra Vitamin D. Another side effect is that

Vitamin C may also decrease availability of the B Vitamins, particularly B6 and B12. One

orange has 70 mil igrams of Vitamin C; it also contains .11 mil igrams of thiamine, .05

mil igrams of riboflavin, etc...The orange also has minerals: 52 mil igrams of calcium, 18

mil igrams of phosphorus, etc.... When you take a Vitamin C supplement you are only

getting Vitamin C and none of the other vitamins and minerals in proportion that our

Creator intended for you to have as a total package.

We know that the ratio of Vitamin C to Vitamin D is important; that the ratio of

potassium to magnesium is important; and the ratio of calcium to magnesium is important.

But what about those we do not know about? Since our knowledge is so limited in al the

proper ratios, it is possible for us to cause a body imbalance by indiscriminately taking

vitamin and mineral supplements. I recommend that we eat natural foods, which have al



179

the vitamins and minerals we need in them, even the ones we haven't discovered yet; and

that we not waste our money or health on supplements.



"NATURAL VERSUS SYNTHETIC VITAMINS

Paul Stitt, a biochemist, and food scientists for some of the largest corporations in

the United States, reports that government regulations require that only three percent of a

food supplement be natural ingredients before the food can be labeled "natural" He points

out that because synthetic vitamins are so much less expensive, it is likely that many of

the "natural" vitamins on the market are 97% synthetic. He says it would require 30

oranges to produce one 1000 mg. vitamin C tablet, and a bottle of al natural vitamin C

tablets could cost about four hundred dol ars(l) It should be noted, however that even if the

bottle of Vitamin C were al from oranges and cost four hundred dol ars, it would stil not

be natural Vitamin C, as it has been separated from the orange. Get your Vitamin C from

the true source, the food itself.



MEGA VITAMINS/LEARNING DISORDERS

A group of 20 children with learning disabilities were given large doses of ascorbic

acid, niacinamide, calcium pantothenate and pyrodoxine, along with a low-carbohydrate,

high-protein diet. After a six-month period, the children receiving the megavitamins

demonstrated no significant improvement as compared to a group treated by diet alone.



MEGA VITAMIN THERAPY/VISION LOSS

Three adult males, given massive doses of nicotinic acid for treatment of high

cholesterol, suffered from loss of central vision. Nicotinic acid may induce retention of fluid

and swel ing in the eye leading to loss of vision. After the nicotinic acid was discontinued,

some improvement in vision occurred.



CALCIUM/BONE STRENGTH

Large doses of calcium may decrease bone strength instead of strengthening them.

Large calcium supplements alter the ratio, and may produce weakening, of the bones.

High calcium levels also interfere with Vitamin K function, and may lead to internal

bleeding.

Dr. Walter Mertz of the Human Nutrition Research Center of the United States

Department of Agriculture in Beltsvil e, Maryland, observed that the absorption of iron and

zinc is blocked by calcium supplements.



CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS/ARTHRITIS

Calcium supplements may induce symptoms of arthritis in sensitive patients. A 67

year old woman developed pain, swel ing, and redness in her right thumb after she began

taking calcium supplements. Symptoms cleared within about two weeks after the calcium

supplement was discontinued. She was later started on Os-Cal as a calcium supplement,

and within two weeks the symptoms recurred, and cleared only after the cessation of the

calcium intake. Some people may be very sensitive to calcium supplements.



VITAMIN A/CANCER RISK

Because special studies have suggested that Vitamin A is protective against

cancer, some people are recommending supplements. Suzanne T. Orr, Ph.D., of the

Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine of the University of Maryland

School of Medicine in Baltimore, observes that Vitamin A may be easily obtained by



180

dietary sources of provitamin A, found in many vegetables and fruits. ONE SERVING of

carrot, cantaloupe, cabbage, celery, turnip greens, sweet potato, kale, mango or many

other natural foods is sufficient to provide the RDA. ( Clinical Nutrition 4:138-142, 1985).



VITAMIN C/COMMON COLD

Vitamin C has not been proven to change the course of a common cold. Over-the-

counter medications are of dubious value. If one ingredient is helpful the others in the

combination may be in improper balance for effective results. ( European Jouranl of

Pediatrics 144:4-8, 1985).



VITAMIN C/IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA

Taking large doses (1500 mg. daily) of vitamin C to prevent colds may lead to iron-

deficiency anemia, apparently by blockage of the effects of copper, which is essential for

iron transport in the blood. Male volunteers given vitamin C supplements developed iron-

deficiency anemia despite an adequate iron intake. ( Science News 124:281, October 29,

1983).

There is a long list of experts in the field of nutrition who are expressing grave

concerns over the health threat from taking vitamins.

Our actual need for vitamins has been greatly exaggerated. The actual amount of

vitamins the human body needs for one year is very smal . Every vitamin necessary for

your body can be found in the food we eat. If we would eat a large variety of fresh food

(cooking partial y destroys vitamins), we wil not become vitamin deficient. We had a guest

named Betty in our 26-day lifestyle session. When she came she brought with her a

medium sized box ful of expensive organic supplements that she was ingesting every

day. She thought she needed these supplements and could not understand why she was

so nervous, felt weak, had a duodenal ulcer and gal bladder problems. She stopped

taking her expensive supplements, and with proper nutrition, at the end of the 26 day

session, she was not as nervous, had plenty of energy, her ulcer was completely healed,

and she was not suffering gal bladder problems anymore. Betty learned, while attending

our session, that the Creator intended for us to get our vitamins from whole natural foods,

and not from a vitamin bottle, as these are unnatural and can cause many health

problems.

WRINKLES



What To Do For Them





You are as beautiful as what you eat.

Eat plenty of fresh fruits which are high in minerals,

enzymes, and vitamins, especial y Vitamin C which

assures integrity of connective tissue which wil support

and strengthen the skin. If this support is not there, the

skin becomes loose and wrinkled(1).

Fluoride levels as low as one part per mil ion, the

amount added to city water supplies, wil cause a

breakdown of col agen, which makes up about thirty

percent of the body. Disruption of this basic structural

material - its synthesis and repair - results in skin

wrinkling(2). Deficient nutrition shows up first in the skin, because the body's wil to survive

causes available nutrients to be rushed to the vital organs.

Drink plenty of pure water, which helps circulation and wil lessen wrinkles. Use no

supplements, especial y calcium which causes wrinkling.

Trying to feed the skin from the outside by applying most types of lotions do little good

for anybody except those who sel them.



TWO LOTIONS I RECOMMENDED ARE COLD PRESSED OLIVE OIL AND FRESH

ALOE VERA .



We must feed the skin from the inside. Sensitive skin and a reddish nose or

cheeks, ruddy from broken capil aries, are signs of nutritional deficiency. When the skin is

dry and scaly, it is usual y from not drinking enough water.

Stress can cause wrinkles, such as a negative attitude reflected in habitual

wrinkles. Those who frown al the time acquire permanent frowning wrinkles. Those who

smile and laugh a lot acquire pleasant wrinkles. We can many times tel what kind of

disposition a person has by looking at the lines on his face.

Authorâ€™s Note



This revised electronic edition of my book is being made available to the general

public. I am now retired and I feel compel ed to share once again the results that were

accomplished when I had my clinic. The clients checked into the clinic for a period of 26

days and because I was able to control nearly al aspects of their diet, exercise, herbs, etc

we had impressive results. Most of the clients had their health restored, al improved and

Thanks to God we had no deaths. So the information you are about to read can help you

just as it helped my clients. Gods ways are simple, mans are not. By faithful y fol owing

these simple remedies you to can live a healthier life.

NATURAL CURE FOR AIDS To increase T-cel production use raw garlic.



NATURAL CURE FOR ANEMIA For an iron deficiency use blackstrap molasses, as it

is 3 times higher in iron then liver.



NATURAL CURE FOR ARTHRITIS A scientific study done at Wayne University

Medical School showed that a meat free, dairy free diet resulted in complete remission of

arthritis in the majority of participants.



NATURAL CURE FOR CANCER The herb Red Clover,(Trifolium Pratense), has been

used for over 100 years to treat and prevent cancer. It is good for cancer on any part of

the body.



NATURAL CURE FOR DIABETES Sunlight helps lower blood sugar, so everyday be

sure you are getting plenty of sunshine.



NATURAL CURE FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE A study done by the government,

(MRFIT) as reported in the Journal of American Medical Association (1982 JAMA 248:

1465-1477) found that the coronary mortality was 70% higher in a group of hypertensive

patients that received aggressive treatment when compared to a control group who

received no treatment. Conclusion High blood pressure drugs kil ed more people then

they helped. One simple way to help lower your blood pressure is to eliminate al caffeine

as found in coffee, tea and colas from your diet.



NATURAL CURE FOR HEADACHES Drink more water, as the brain is close to 90%

FOREWORDS



As a health professional, I am excited about the information that Dr. Hoover shares

in this book. The health field is flooding with new information about health, much of it

being very risky and dangerous. This information ranges from new drugs and high-tech

surgery to the effectiveness of simple natural treatments that people can do at home. This

can be a very confusing time for people. How can a person differentiate between fact and

fiction with so much information to examine? I believe the answer to that important

question can be found in this book. People need to have the facts. If they understand the

basic laws of health, then by reasoning from cause to effect they wil be able to wisely

determine the best health care answer for their health problems.



These facts are time tested and apply to al people al the time. They are the laws

that govern the human body. These laws cannot be broken without consequence and

cannot be kept without benefit.



In my practice, I have observed in working with hundreds of patients that those who

fol ow these laws of health get wel much more quickly and hold their adjustments much

better than those who donâ€™t.



Dr. Hooverâ€™s years of experience in teaching and applying these laws of health has

made him very effective in sharing them with others. His straightforward style, using

laymanâ€™s terminology, makes the facts exciting to read as wel as clear and logical. Those

who read this information wil have a real advantage in todayâ€™s health jungle. Not only wil

they be armed with the facts, but they also wil enjoy better health as they fol ow the

simple truths that they learn.

â€œThe wil to winâ€ is more important than â€œthe skil to winâ€ We are al designed to win;

and in order to win we must focus on Whatâ€™s Important Now. In my years as a

Naturopathic Physician and a Florida State Licensed Nutritional Counselor, I feel Whatâ€™s

Important Now is that we make health our first concern and not our last resort; most of us

give up on our health in quest for wealth, just to spend the wealth to regain our health. Dr.

Jerry Hooverâ€™s monumental piece of work, â€œNatural Medicineâ€, has laid out the simple

truths of taking care of this miracle machine we cal the human body.



I feel this book wil satiate your quest for zest ultimately adding cheers to your

years. We are al healthy by design and sick by default. If you invest in yourself, youâ€™l

never make a bad investment and the interest just keeps growing and growing with no

service charge!



As an international Speaker and Mentor to thousands, books about health come

across my desk al the time asking for my opinion and approval; and I am glad to see one

such as Dr. Hooverâ€™s pass the testâ€¦ straightforward answers to keep us happy, healthy

and in control!

PREFACE


Naturopathy is a therapeutic system that does not use drugs or therapy, but

employs natural forces such as light, air, water, etc. â€œNatureâ€ means â€œnot artificial, but

lifelike.â€ â€œPathyâ€ means â€œhealing crises.â€ So, a true Doctor of Naturopathy wil not use

anything artificial to cure il ness. But wil al ow the body to heal itself by using natural

methods. Thus: A Naturopathic Doctor is a Doctor of Natural Healing.



When a naturalist sees a person suffering from disease caused by improper eating,

drinking and other wrong health habits, yet neglects to tel him of this, he is doing his

fel ow being an injury. We are complex beings, functioning on physical, mental and

spiritual levels. The factors most strongly influencing our health are the eight natural

remedies of Fresh Air, Pure Water, Sunshine, Natural Food, Rest, Exercise, Temperance

and Trust in God.



I have been a health advocate for over 35 years. I can stil remember back on New

Yearâ€™s Eve, 1969, when I made a resolution to become a vegetarian and since then I have

continued learning how to use effectively the natural means for healing.



The writing of this book was the best way I could acquaint you with the many

natural ways to better health. I see many for whom no drug or surgery wil restore health.

In spite of many scientific advances, we stil remain humbly, pitiful y, dependent upon the

natural forces of nature to bring about the abundant health that many of my clients have

experienced.





75-year old

Swimming Champâ€™s

Healthy Lifestyle





The fol owing story is taken from â€œHealthful Livingâ€/1986 and reprinted here by kind

permission of the author:



â€œCatherine Cress, 75, glides through the water with scarcely a ripple. She could be

demonstrating the perfect breast stroke to a swimming classâ€¦



â€œShe can swim faster than anyone else in the country her age. She can swim faster

than most people far younger.â€



So wrote Pamela Livingston, staff writer for the Roswel Daily Record, Roswel ,

New Mexico, in the July 1, 1985, edition.



At 5â€™2â€ and 95 pounds, Catherine Cress is the fastest 75-79 year old breast stroke

swimmer in the United States.



In Milwaukee in the spring of 1985, she broke al the records of any previous

winners of 75 â€“ 79 year olds for the 50 yards, the 100 yards and the 200 yard breast

stroke. She has received al kinds of medals for swimming, recently and when she was a

15 to 20 year old girl.

How does Catherine Cress, now age 76, stay in shape to swim extraordinarily in

these meets? For the past 18 years, sheâ€™s been swimming one mile four to five mornings

a week. She says: â€œI never miss because I never get sick. For 25 years I havenâ€™t been to a



8
