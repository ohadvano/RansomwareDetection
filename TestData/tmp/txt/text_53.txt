I smile. “You know, I never thanked you for last night. You stepped in and stopped Bane from hurting me.”
He shrugs. “Don't mention it. I only did what I thought was right.”
“I know but thanks. It meant a lot to me.”
As the both of us turn to enter the house, Ryder stands in the hall with his hands in his pockets, looking at the two of us curiously. He indicates with his head to the living room.
When I enter the living room, I see that Bane and Silver have taken place on the sofa covered in Afghans thanks to Sam who sits in the armchair. She's still looking at Bane again with a huge grin on her face. Ryder takes his place standing by the window, while Kellan remains by my side.
I leave the room to grab Kellan a spare blanket but when I return I notice that nobody has said a word.
After what feels like hours of intense silence, Sam decides to break the ice.
“Alright, what the hell is going on?”
When nobody answers, she looks at me questioningly.
