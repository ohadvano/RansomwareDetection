“I’m Gatril,” she said. “I’m his friend.”
The spider closed the book, and between her mandibles they could see her lips making a smile. “This is quite the surprise. I was just reading a tale about a human female, falling in love with a beast. To think I’d see something similar even here. The universe must like me.”
Kiran said, “I don’t mean to be rude, mam, but I want to ask you a few questions.”
“You come into my domain, and want to question me?” the spider narrowed her eyes.
Kiran and Gatril’s nerves went array, and their spines wanted out through their backs,
“Shit,” said Gatril. “Quick, Kiran offer to eat her crotch!”
Kiran was a stuttering wreck: “I-I-I-I—”
“Enough!” said Gatril. She approached the spider, flinching when she saw the size of her mandibles. Seven inches. The size of Kiran’s cock. “Now look here!” Gatril pointed, but her finger was too close to the spider’s face and she dropped it. “We just—”
The spider grabbed Gatril by the throat. Gatril tired prying her hand open but the spider’s strength was more than hears, a mighty dragon.
Kiran’s spine suddenly straightened in his back. “Gatril!” He approached the spider. His staff raised with orb for the force-counter pulsing. “Put her down! Please!”
“My,” the spider said, her mandibles salivating. “I’ve never had a dragon before.”
“Bitch!” Gatril squeaked.
“I said drop her!” Kiran boomed.
The spider finally recognized Kiran’s killing intent and payed him heed. She sensed a supernatural force emanating from his staff, and narrowed two of her eyes at him. “You’re a sorcerer…”
“That’s right,” Kiran said, trying his best to contain his rage. “Now put her down before I tear this place down!”
The spider dropped Gatril, not out of fear, but intrigue with the human. Gatril gasped for air and retreated behind Kiran. “You freaky bug! The next time you do that you’ll regret it!”
The spider rose, tendons and chitinous body parts rubbing together like sandpaper. At three meters, she towered over them.
“Human, how many spells do you know?” said the spider.
“Four,” said Kiran. He and Gatril looked at each other with uncertainty. 
“Why would a spider be interested in spells?” said Gatril.
“Isn’t it obvious by what your eyes see?” said the arachnid. “I’ve become enlightened. I no longer thrive on my instincts except to feed to maintain my health.”
“Is that why you haven’t laid any eggs?” said Gatril.
“Yes,” she replied. “I’ve recently stopped accepting offers from the males. They are lowly beasts. Not bright in the head. I’ve sharpened my mind, nourishing it with the knowledge of humans.”  She showed them her hand, conjuring within it a ghostly white energy that danced like a swirling mist.
“That’s…spirit energy,” Kiran said.
The spider closed her hand and the energy vanished. “I’ve grown fond of this power that some humans possess, to point where I managed to discover it in myself. Kiran, if you can teach me about magic, I can give you the queex you want.”
“What?” Gatril turned to Kiran, expecting to see him speechless just like her, but the boy smiling much to her dismay.
“Wow!” said Kiran. “That sounds like a fair trade.”
Gatril grabbed Kiran by the shoulders and quickly walked him back to the mouth of the room. “What are you doing?” Gatril whispered.
“What’s wrong?” said Kiran.
Gatril pinched his lips. She looked over her shoulder at the spider’s six eyes visually ravaging her. Gatril flinched and turn to Kiran. “You can’t teach her magic. You’ve seen what she did to those bodies. Imagine if she starts walking around with a bunch of spells.”
Kiran’s train of thought came an abrupt stop, reversing to take another route that brought him upon a different outcome. “Oh, no,” he said.
“I can hear you, you know,” said the spider.
Kiran and Gatril spun around with innocent smiles. “Umm, you might have misheard,” said Kiran. “We were just talking about how pretty your vagina looks?”
The spider flexed her arms. “You don’t have much of a choice,” she said. “Either teach me about magic and get my queex, or I trap you here until you change your mind. One scream, and all the males will come running in at my side.”
“Then we’ll just have to make this quick,” said Kiran, raising his staff.
