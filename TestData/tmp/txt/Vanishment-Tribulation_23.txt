On a street in Lisbon, Portugal, a man has just bought half a loaf of bread in a store, now he is headed to another store in hope of finding butter or maybe even some meat, which is very rare. In the distance he sees what looks like a huge flock of birds flying close to the ground.
They are so thick. Then he hears what sounds like a collective scream, but far away. The sound gets closer, and closer. Then he sees them. It is "the Swarm," and they are swooping everywhere randomly attacking nearly everyone as they go along. There are thousands and thousands of them. A rolling wave of screams is going out as the Swarm makes its way toward him. Within seconds he is attacked and stung several times.  His scream joins the thousands of others. The pain is excruciating. No torture ever devised could match it.
Someone in the crowd in Lisbon uploads a video to the LANX website just as the Swarm begins its attack. Jill Steiner is the first to air the coverage. She immediately knows what it is, and what it means.
Jill: "News has just come in of the Swarm attacking citizens in Europe. Roll that video now." The video shows a frightening scene of the "Swarm" appearing suddenly in the skies and pouncing on the helpless population below as it proceeds. It darkens the sky as it approaches. Then it strikes. A rolling wave of collective screams is heard as the first sign it is approaching. When they get closer to the camera, their physical appearance is frightening.
Jill tells her audience: "These are not creatures of this world. These are demons who have come to torture the human race."
Then Jill begins to read from Revelation and also from her book:
Revelation 9:6 “During those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them. 7  The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces. 8  Their hair was like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth. 9 They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. 10 They had tails with stingers, like scorpions, and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months.”
Jill: "Let me also read from my book:"
"The first thing to note is that these demons are visible to humans. This demon criminal group is compared to an army prepared for battle. They travel in swarms and make a horrifying noise which adds to the paralyzing fear they induce among their victims. The look of this demon army is like cavalry riding into battle with helmets, emblems and armor. The individual demons are fierce looking with faces resembling man."
Revelation 9:11 “They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer).”
The demon army is led by the number two demon of all time, Abaddon.  At the Fall of Satan, 1/3 of all angels followed Satan and his top lieutenant Abaddon.  It should be noted this is Satan attacking his own people, since they are attacking mostly unbelievers, and those believers who depart from their faith.  The mantra is “make them suffer!” Evil has no loyalty. This part of the angelic conflict shows Satan as ruler of the earth is incapable of being “like the Most High God” which power he lusted for and caused his original Fall. Satan uses people and spits them out, like any other unfair and ungrateful dictator. And he dared to think of himself as equal to God."
Reports continued to come into the studio showing that the Swarm started in several locations around the world at the same time. In Europe it started in Portugal which is the western-most major city in continental Europe, and spread eastward. Additional Swarms began on all the other continents at the same time. Over the next several weeks the Swarms made their way into all parts of the seven continents, having spread in all directions. Then they randomly went back to where they had previously terrorized their victims and attacked again, so that no one knew where or when they would strike.  There was no place to hide from them.  They could not even be locked out of buildings, so there was no safe place. But believers were unaffected by the stinging demons.
During the next five months Jill covered the effects of the "stinging demons" as they inflicted excruciating pain on their victims all over the earth. They continued to strike randomly when least expected, which made their torture even more intense and it drove fear into the hearts of people everywhere. Since no one knew when or where they would strike next, intense and debilitating fear became part of daily life, along with starvation, thirst, and pain.
After several months of "the swarm" roving the earth, unbelievers everywhere are at the breaking point. They can no longer stand the intense pain of their attacks, the anxiety of not knowing when they would appear next, and the fear of what all of this meant. But they remained hardened in their resolve that God was not the answer for them. Suicides skyrocketed in number.
Jill reports the news of the end of the demon torture: "After five months of torture the attacks have ended. Just as suddenly as "the swarm" had appeared, they just as suddenly departed.
The air is now clear of them. People everywhere are rejoicing that this scourge is finally over. Several months of this torture was nearly unbearable. It has been just over six years since the Vanishment, so we are less than one year from the end of the Tribulation. That end is called Armageddon."
Jill concludes her report on the end of the Swarm by quoting from Revelation 9:12: “The first woe is past; two other woes are yet to come.”
CHAPTER 26
TRUMPET #6 / WOE #2

Within a few weeks the Swarm was back. This time they came prepared to kill. And kill they did. They appeared first in the Middle East, somewhere near the Euphrates River in Iraq.
From there they quickly spread out in all directions. This group moved faster than the first Swarm, which stopped to sting it victims. This Second Swarm plowed through cities and towns and just kept going at a high rate of speed.
Jill covers the story on her daily news broadcast within minutes of the first attacks, having been alerted by eyewitnesses in several countries. The video was frightening to watch, as people were mowed down like grass by these killer demons.
Jill: "After several weeks of absence "the Swarm" has returned, and this time they are lethal. In the previous attacks they inflicted severe pain, but did not kill.  But now they are killing their victims.  Let us look at what the Bible says about what we are seeing happen before our eyes.  Jill reads from Revelation 9:13:
“The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God. 14 It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” 15 And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind.”
Then Jill turns to her book and reads:
"The sixth Trumpet (Second Woe) sets loose another huge demon army imprisoned deep under the Euphrates River led by four demon princes. This second demon army was also put into chains due to an angelic conflict violation in ancient times before man was created. We can see that Satan's armies in ancient times fought a vicious battle against the elect angels loyal to God, even to the point of violating the rules established by God, for which they were imprisoned. They are now released, not only to further torment mankind, but these demons are also allowed to kill 1/3 of remaining unbelieving mankind.  They target unbelievers except for those Satan wants to spare for his own purposes, mainly those who are demon possessed.  Satan will need some  people to be spared for his coming battle to kill the Jews.  Satan believes that if he eliminates the Jews, God would be defeated since God promised the Jews a Millennial Kingdom where Christ will rule over regathered Israel in the land promised to them.  If the Jews are killed off, God could not fulfill His promise.  This is the main reason why the Jews are targeted throughout human history.
Jill once again turns to her favorite Professor for explanations. Professor Heathrow from USC is back in the studio with her.
Jill: "Professor Heathrow, the First Woe was demon torture of people, and now the Second Woe has been unleashed. These demons are now killing people. Would you please explain why this is happening?"
Professor Heathrow: "It is happening because Satan is desperate. He is out of options, and will soon be thrown into prison. His plan has devolved into something like "create enough chaos, death, and destruction and anything is possible." He is trying to prevent being thrown into the Lake of Fire. But he will fail. Regarding the specifics of what is happening, let us take a look at a staggering statistic.
First, the three “Woes” are sequential. The initial Woe, the stinging demons, lasted five months and is now past. The Swarm inflicted its intense pain on the world for five very long months. Now the sixth Trumpet Judgment, which is also called the “Second Woe,” has today been unleashed. There will be a "Third Woe" during the seventh Trumpet Judgment which includes the Second Advent and Armageddon. We can see the timing of these three Woes is very late in the Tribulation. So we have less than a year remaining before the Lord returns and Armageddon becomes a reality."
He continues:  "The Bible reveals the enormous size of this new group of killer demons. Revelation 9:16 says:
“The number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number.”
"Let us do the math.  We see that the number is 2 x 10,000 x 10,000 = 200,000,000.  That is a huge army of demons which cannot be avoided or defended against.  They will roll through cities, nations, and continents like a giant war machine killing unbelievers at will.  But believers will be spared because God will only allow these demons to attack unbelievers.  As Revelation 9:17 says:
“The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this: Their breastplates were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke and sulfur.”
Professor Heathrow continues: "Again we see this demon army is visible to mankind, and looks like a cavalry army prepared and dressed for battle, which is their purpose. The demons travel massed together, spewing poisons from their collective “mouths” as they proceed. The demons are mounted on some type of war machines which have weapons in both front and back. Then we see how many people will be killed, and the numbers are staggering:
Revelation 9:18 “A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths. 19 The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails were like snakes, having heads with which they inflict injury.”
"This means the demons use chemical and biological agents to kill large numbers of unbelievers, which is fully 1/3 of those remaining who survived everything that has happened so far.  The demon war machines spew killing agents from the front, and poison also comes from a snake-like tail whipping back and forth.  Once again, God protects His own and they are spared."
Revelation 9:20 “The rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood—idols that cannot see or hear or walk.”
Jill interjects: "So Professor, the unbelievers will still generally refuse to believe in Jesus Christ for salvation. They become further hardened against God. They prefer to worship Satan's religious systems of empty deities, money, immorality, human power, sorcery, drug addiction, human sacrifice, and resort to violence and general human degeneracy of all forms. The Tribulation forces each person to choose between God and total degeneracy."
Professor Heathrow: "Quite right. As the end nears, only the most hardened unbelievers remain since demon armies will have killed all other unbelievers. The earth is now down to a hard-core set of degenerate unbelievers. That will be when Armageddon comes, which is part of the 7th Trumpet Judgment, which includes the Third Woe, and it will be delayed until the end of the Tribulation. In the meantime, the Bowl Judgments will begin."
Jill: "Thank you Professor Heathrow. You have been so kind to come in for these interviews. I hope to see you again soon."
Producer Jack Ford has been watching for video coming in which would show the Swarm. It did not take long. Video has now come into the studio from a town in eastern Turkey showing the scene of horror. Jack says into Jill's earpiece: "The person sent it directly to you, Jill.
Warn people that it will not be easy to watch."
Jill: "We have a video of an attack by the Swarm which has just taken place a couple minutes ago in Turkey. Beware that my Producer says this video is hard to watch. You have been warned."
The video appears on screen showing the Swarm moving toward a town, turning the sky dark, and closing in quickly. A young woman standing with her friends is filming the event. As the Swarm comes nearer, individual members of the Swarm can be seen in more detail. They are large, multi-colored, and each one has a rider perched on top of some sort of war machine with a large opening on the front and a swishing tail on the back end. A gas is shooting out forcefully from front and back, one color from the front, and another from the back. People below fall down as they pass overhead. Every person. They writhe and scream in agony, but do not die immediately. The Swarm closes in on the young woman, who continues to video the event. She says as they are about to reach her "I hope you get this, Jill!" The video then shows a yellow gas coming at her with great velocity, and then she falls down. Her camera falls from her hand and points toward a group of people who had been standing near her, and it shows them all writhing on the ground and screaming in pain. The video continues for some time, since they do not die right away. It takes several minutes, and then each one goes limp, one by one, until they are all motionless.
Jill: "I had no idea she was going to say my name! Poor girl. She knew we were watching and wanted us to show this to the world." Jill needs a minute to collect herself after the video stops. Producer Jack Ford shows another less gruesome one to give Jill some time.
Then Jill continues: "As you have seen, this Second Swarm, called the Second Woe in the Bible, is another level of judgment on the earth. It will be here in LA before long. It will be everywhere soon. Are you ready for eternity?"
The following day there is more grim video. Too much to deal with. Producer Jack Ford airs some segments to show close-ups of the individual Swarm members. They are fierce and other-worldly looking. But oddly, they appear to be laughing as they go about their hideous task. They seem to be enjoying it. Jack Ford rolls the video back several times in slow motion to confirm. Yes, they are laughing, shouting, and gesturing to each other. But mostly just laughing.
Jill returns to reporting other news while Producer Jack Ford has been putting together the statistics for the death toll so far.  Starting in the Middle East, initial reports show 1/3 of the people in each city or town the Swarm goes through have died.  After just an hour, the death toll is estimated to be over 5 million people.
Jill: "At this rate, the death toll will be over a billion before this is over."
As her broadcast ends for the day, Jill thinks to herself: "Another billion people dead.  That would mean the total death toll during this Tribulation has been 70% of the world's population.  Many billions of people, and it is not nearly over.  We still have many Bowls and Armageddon ahead of us.  We were told this over 2000 years ago, and now it is here."
She thinks about how she missed the Rapture, then says to herself: "I must stop thinking about what I missed. I am here now for a purpose.”
CHAPTER 27
THE BOWL JUDGMENTS

It has been 6 1/2 years since the Vanishment.  Less than six months remain until Armageddon and the return of the Lord.  Although the unbelievers are bearing most of the judgments, the faith of believers is being severely tested.  Only those faithful until the very end of the Tribulation will go into the Millennial Kingdom and live another 1000 years in perfect environment.  The testing has caused some believers to take the Mark of the Beast, and most of them died at the hands of the Swarm demons.  Many believers have acted like unbelievers to hide their faith from the unbelieving world.  And some others refused to obey the specific commands in the Bible which were meant for them, including some believers in Israel who refused to flee at the Midpoint.  Among those who fled to the mountains from Israel, some departed their hiding place and died.  This was not a time for being a casual believer.  There were only two sides, and each person had to choose one side or the other.  There was no middle ground.  Decisions meant life or death.
Back in Israel the remnant of believers who had fled to the mountains east of Israel see that the time of the Lord's return is drawing near. Josh Simmons, the leader of the Jews in exile, talks to the Jews who are gathered about the next series of judgments which are about to commence. Josh speaks to the assembled congregation:
"It is now time for the seven Bowl Judgments to avenge the killing of believers during the Tribulation. These judgments will be the worst seen in all of human history, and lead up to the return of Jesus Christ at the Second Advent. God does not cause misery without a good reason. These Bowls occur very late in the second half of the Tribulation between the 6th and 7th Trumpet Judgments, after God has sent many forms of evangelization to those who are about to be severely judged." Josh reads from his book:
"So far during the Tribulation there have been natural disasters, man-made disasters, and divine judgments revealed by the Seals, including the first six Trumpet Judgments. Now the seven Bowl Judgments will be unleashed on the earth, which occur after the Sixth Trumpet Judgment. God's patience is at an end."
Then Josh reads from Revelation:
Revelation 15:1 “I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with the seven last plagues—last, because with them God’s wrath is completed.”
Revelation 16:7 “And I heard the altar respond: “Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are your judgments.”
"Those in Heaven who have offered prayers to have the deaths of the martyrs avenged acknowledge the perfect Justice of God."
Josh continues, providing encouragement that they are nearing the end of their time in the mountains: "These seven last plagues or Bowl Judgments are executed between the 6th and 7th Trumpet Judgments. Since they are called the “last plagues” they occur very close to the end of the Tribulation. The Trumpet Judgments are executed throughout the period of the Great Tribulation, which is the last 3 ½ years, so the Bowl Judgments fit in very near the end. We have about six months remaining until the Lord returns, then we will depart these mountains and return to our homeland."
At the same time Josh is addressing the Jews in the mountains near Petra, Jill Steiner is in her LA apartment unable to sleep. She knows there is a next round of judgments about to be revealed. She reads from her book so she will know what to expect.
"Upon the command of the Lord the seven Bowl Judgments begin, and the first Bowl causes unbelievers on earth to break out in awful, thick, painful sores in judgment for worshiping the Antichrist and taking the mark of the Beast.  This judgment hearkens back to the Pharaoh of Egypt and the plague of sores in ancient Egypt.  The unbelievers of the Tribulation took the Mark of the Beast, and since they like marks on their skin, God is about to give them pockmarks all over their bodies.  And the pain associated with them will be excruciating.  As Revelation 16:1 says:
“Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go, pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath on the earth.”  2 The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly, festering sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.”
Jill closes her book and thinks about what that means. The current world is about to be judged for how it has treated the believers of the Tribulation, just as the Pharaoh of Egypt was judged 3000 years ago using numerous plagues for refusing to free the Jews from captivity after 400 years of slavery. She goes to sleep thinking about the parallelism of the two time periods.
The following morning Jill is on her way to work, walking down the sidewalk near her news studio building. Suddenly a collective shriek goes up from nearly all the people on the street around her. They are jumping and swatting and crying in pain. People jump out of cars in the middle of the street and writhe and jostle their clothing. At first Jill did not know what happened, but then she sees everyone is covered with red sores on every inch of their exposed skin. It is apparent from the expressions of pain that the sores cover their entire bodies.
Jill hurries on into her building and gets to the news room as fast as she can. She looks at her own skin, but nothing unusual. Jack Ford meets her as she is entering the studio, and his skin is clear. But then she starts seeing the staff, and most of them are affected by the painful skin sores. For the crew the pain was so intense that most could not continue to work. Jack had to take over the camera duties to allow Jill to go on with her news show.
Jack was doing double duty, putting up video and handling the camera. Jack showed video and Jill described what she had seen on the street near her news studio. Eyewitness accounts from around the world all showed the same thing. Most of the people of the world now had painful red sores all over their bodies. And the emphasis was on pain. Nothing could reduce the intensity of it except to try to avoid having the skin touch anything at all. Even soft clothing irritated the sores.
Within the next few days it became obvious that the skin sores had an enormous impact on people everywhere. The pain was intense. Sitting on the sores was very painful, and lying down was almost impossible since so many of the sores became involved. Sleep was therefore nearly impossible, except in very short sessions under extreme exhaustion, only minutes at a time. Just wearing clothing was painful. Within days the world was full of people sleep- walking through their miserable existence. They walked bow-legged with their arms outstretched to avoid touching any sores. While most of the early disasters had been either localized or affected people indirectly, even though severely, the sores put the pain right to each person directly and continually, much like the stinging Swarm had done. It was highly effective at getting people's attention that they were being judged.
Jill noted that very few turned to God as the answer.  The world was now in a state of extreme hardness.  The Second Swarm had killed so many people, nearly 1/3 of all those who were on the earth.  And that was after many had been already killed by famine, disease, war, and disasters.  Except for believers who were spared these judgments, those unbelievers who had survived the Swarm of killer demons were mainly those who had no remaining conscience.
While most of the judgments lasted for a relatively short duration and then ended, the sores remained and did not go away. They turned people into the walking dead, living at the most basic level of bare existence, waiting for their final end. It would not be long.
But in the meantime more judgments were coming. Jill provided her viewers a preview of what was about to happen next. She began to summarize for her audience at the end of each news broadcast what was coming in the near future. She still had many who watched her news show from all over the world. But most refused to accept the truth of what was behind all of it.
Jill's summary at the end of her daily broadcast started out as:
"All sea life will soon die, all drinking water will become undrinkable, the sun will scorch the skin, the world will be plunged into darkness, the way will be prepared for Armageddon, and then Armageddon will finally come, and it is less than six months away."
Within a few days the second Bowl Judgment hit. It targeted sea life.
Residents of the ocean-side community of Malibu, California awoke to see red waves breaking on the beach. It was a disgusting sight, and looked to these residents like blood. In fact, it turned out to actually be blood. This scene repeated in beach communities all over the US, and all over the world. The ocean waves were blood. Soon afterward dead sea creatures began washing onshore. First fish, then starfish and turtles, then whales.  The rotting carcasses became even more disgusting than the blood waves. Soon the stench became unbearable. Oceanographers from around the world used sophisticated instruments to try to determine the extent of the issue. Why were these sea creatures dying in droves? Which types were affected, and which types survived? What they found shocked them. They found no living sea creature of any type in any ocean or sea anywhere on earth. None. All sea creatures were dead, down to the last krill. They concluded this was not a natural event, but an unnatural one. But they refused to see it as a supernatural event.
It was just as Jill had been telling her audience. And as she had become known for doing, Jill read to her audience from Revelation and from her book:
Revelation 16:3 “The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died.”
"The 2nd Bowl turns all the oceans to blood and kills all remaining sea life.  The rain cycle is also disrupted by this judgment since the oceans are key to rain formation. Recall that the Trumpet Judgment had previously killed 1/3 of all sea life, so this Bowl occurs later since all sea life is now killed."
With all sea life dead, there was no food from the seas or oceans. This had been one of the few remaining food options, and now it was gone. And if that were not enough, the painful red sores persisted. And the pain never became any more bearable. Not to mention how ugly everyone had become, which ruined their self-esteem.
Jill reported on how the Bowl Judgments were affecting people. How it disrupted their entire life. Work, play, eating, social life, sleep -- everything was affected. The little pleasures of life were gone. She continually reminded her audience of why these were occurring, and how close the end of the Tribulation is at this point.
Within a month of the blood waves, the third Bowl Judgment hit. The drinking water supply was targeted. Again. Now the entire remaining drinking water supply turned undrinkable.
The world was already starving and thirsty. But now that would be taken to a new level. Jill reads to her audience:
Revelation 16:4 “The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. 5 Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say: “You are just in these judgments, O Holy One, you who are and who were; 6 for they have shed the blood of your holy people and your prophets, and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve.”
It is not an accident that the "blood" theme recurs over and over. God is reminding the unbelieving world of what they did to His own people. Believers had been murdered by those following, and those not resisting, the Antichrist. Millions of believers had been murdered, beheaded, or starved to death during the past several years. A holocaust targeted Jewish believers. Those who did not oppose the Antichrist were with him. Regardless of how innocent any of the remaining unbelievers seemed, they were on the wrong side of history, meaning they were not on God's side. Bad choices led to bad outcomes. God gave everyone plenty of chances to change their minds, but most had refused. Now they were being judged, and judged severely.
This 3rd Bowl Judgment targeted the remaining supply of drinking water.  The 3rd  Trumpet had previously targeted 1/3 of all drinking water, now the remainder was taken away by this Bowl Judgment.  The unbelievers were bloodthirsty while killing so many believers, so God now gives them blood to drink, making them very, very thirsty.  Believers will have special provisions during all these judgments, but the intensity of the adversities will be felt by all as God removes the most basic necessities for sustaining life from unbelievers.  Since the people on earth could not survive very long without drinking water, Armageddon and the Second Advent are very near.
The next two Bowl Judgments would come in rapid succession. Within a month after the drinking water was destroyed, the fourth Bowl Judgment hit.  Scorching sun began to burn the flesh of everyone who ventured outdoors. There was no way to avoid the sun's scorching heat. The scorching was immediate on any exposed flesh. Even a tiny opening in clothing led to instant first degree burns. And due to the painful red sores, people had turned to wearing as little clothing as possible. So when the scorching sun began, they were caught with much of their skin exposed. That made the scorching even worse, since there would be no time to cover up for anyone out in the open.
The scorching sun also burned up the remaining vegetation. There had not been enough sun to grow crops due to the decreased sunlight, but now the low sunlight also scorched what little vegetation was growing.
Jill reported on the fourth Bowl as unbelievers suffered from severe skin pain, which went along with their starving and intense thirst. This Bowl added more skin pain on top of the already painful skin sores. This skin pain was a very direct targeting of individual comfort.
Jill reads to her audience:
Revelation 16:8 “The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was allowed to scorch people with fire. 9  They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.”
The 4th Trumpet Judgment had diminished the sun, and now the 4th Bowl Judgment causes the remaining daylight hours to yield scorching heat on the inhabitants of the earth as the protective layers of the atmosphere are removed. The world switches from freezing cold to scorching heat on their skin. The world is colder but their skin is burning. The unbelievers of the world are in intense pain. The red sores never went away, then scorching was added. The skin is a major source of pain, since it is so near the nerve endings. God puts the pain where it is felt the most -- on the skin.
Jill wonders if anyone was listening. Really listening. She doubted that any were. They were just moths to the flame. They could not stay away. They watched her news show because they were mesmerized, not because they had any belief system.
CHAPTER 28
INVASION OF ISRAEL

President Antivon, now completely revealed as the Antichrist to all who were willing to see the truth, is losing control over his domain. There is death, disaster, pain and destruction everywhere as the Bowl Judgments take their toll. Food and water are very scarce. There is misery at all levels of society. The streets are filled with chaos, lawlessness, looting, mass unrest and riots. His Citizen's Police forces have been decimated by the judgments so their numbers have dwindled, but the ones who remain continue to kill people at will, especially Christians and Jews. Jewish Christians are their number one target. Assassination attempts on the President and his staff occur regularly. Antivon has lost two Chiefs of Staff as a result. There has been a general breakdown of law and order, as lawless gangs rule the cities.
President Antivon decides to take warfare "on the road" to distract from the internal turmoil at home.
The Western Alliance had made a treaty with Israel early during the Tribulation, but President Antivon now has new plans for the Middle East. The Western Alliance wants to set up a base of operations inside Israel, and use it to invade African countries. That will require a large military presence in the region. Although Israeli Prime Minister Garlock is in his pocket, the Israeli military is not. But it has been reduced to just a small military Resistance unit.
Therefore President Antivon cannot rely on Prime Minister Garlock to deliver Israel over to him, so an invasion and forceful takeover of Jerusalem by Western Forces is required since there will be opposition from the Israeli Resistance. The West's plans are set into motion and within a few weeks Western Alliance ships land at the port of Haifa in western Israel while ground forces enter Israel from the northeast. These two army groups converge on Jerusalem in a pincer movement from the north.
Western Alliance forces close in on the Israeli Resistance forces on the northern outskirts of Jerusalem, and their situation is dire. As the Western forces reach Jerusalem, fighting by the Israeli Resistance under Generals Dayan and Gurian is heroic, but they are overpowered and pushed back into the city, followed by street to street and house to house fighting inside the city. Both sides suffer heavy casualties. The Israeli troops fall back into midtown Jerusalem where they become trapped.
It was then the fifth Bowl Judgment happened -- intense darkness on the Antichrist's kingdom and their military forces.
Revelation 16:10 “The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in agony 11 and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had done.”
The supernatural darkness had two purposes, first to blind the military forces of the Antichrist fighting in Israel, and secondly as a judgment on the Antichrist's kingdom. The supernatural darkness blinded both the Western Alliance soldiers and their electronics, but it did not affect the Israeli Resistance forces in any way. This blindness of the Western Alliance allowed the Israeli Resistance forces to escape straight through the middle of the battle lines of the blinded Western forces.
Since this supernatural intense darkness affected only the Western Alliance, it allowed the Israeli Resistance forces to escape the clutches of the Antichrist's forces and withdraw from Jerusalem. They retreated to the outskirts and joined the forces under General Dayan and General Gurian who had set up defenses south of Jerusalem. The Jewish Resistance forces then regrouped in southern Israel near Bethlehem, where they were able to resupply and bring in additional troops from other locations. With a new hiding place established, their numbers were bolstered, and their supplies were renewed. The Israeli Resistance forces were once again ready to take on the enemy who was occupying Jerusalem. But only when the timing was right.
General Dayan addressed the Jewish Resistance fighters:
"This is the same as what happened during the days when the Pharaoh of Egypt hardened his heart against the Jews, and Moses caused darkness for three days as part of the ten plagues on Egypt.  Moses was in ancient Egypt at that time, and he was here today in Jerusalem near the Temple when our Jewish forces needed to escape.  The ancient Egypt event is recorded in Exodus 10:21:
“Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt.” 22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days. 23  No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.”
General Dayan continues: "The power of the Antichrist has been targeted directly, and his kingdom was turned dark. The empire of darkness got the darkness they deserve. It allowed us to escape from Jerusalem today in order to survive. We cannot go back and fight them directly at this point. But we will have our day soon, and the forces of the Antichrist will be wiped out completely. Of this you can be certain."
Israeli General Dayan proceeds to outline the strategy for the remainder of the war, which will be one of opportunistic strategic engagement and defensive covert withdrawals. They cannot afford to attack the forces of the Antichrist head-on at this point. They must pick their battles wisely and retreat when necessary to survive. They cannot save Jerusalem from the Antichrist forces. But they can have an impact, and they can survive to fight during the final stage when the Lord returns. That is when they will defeat the forces which drove them out of Jerusalem. The Israeli Resistance forces will have their own revenge. But they must remain patient.
"The true heroes of the Jewish cause were the soldiers in Israel who rose up against the Antichrist and the Jewish traitor called the False Prophet. These brave fighters were new believers who risked everything to hold back the onslaught of the evil forces of the Western Alliance. They were the ones protecting the rights of Jews everywhere, even though they were but a few." With that, General Dayan departs to set up the logistics necessary to support the long battles which lie ahead. He knows that his brave troops have an enormous task ahead of them, and the battles will be fierce. He prays for his troops as he walks on ahead.
Armageddon is approaching quickly, and his troops will play a key role on that day as they will be given the task of fighting the Western Alliance forces in south Israel and in Jerusalem.
While that was happening in Israel, in the remainder of the Western Alliance the darkness had another purpose, which was judgment. In addition to the effects on the military forces of the Antichrist, the people of the Western Alliance experienced deep darkness which the sun could not penetrate, or moon or star light. No light of any type could penetrate the supernatural darkness. Flashlights, building lights, street lights, car lights, cell phone light, candle and flame light were all useless. There was no natural or artificial light of any type. Everyone was essentially blind since their eyes could not reveal anything of any type without light. It drove intense fear.
Many people across the entire Western Alliance were caught out of their homes when the darkness struck. There was no way to get home for most people. No one could go to or from work. Even if they were stuck at their workplace no work could be done.  People trying to walk home were seldom successful. There were many injuries from cuts, falls, and other hazards but no one could help them. All sense of a normal life was removed by the darkness. Each person was forced to focus primarily on their own thoughts since they could not engage in any of their normal distractions. No online interaction, no reading, and getting food to eat was very difficult. Not even a gas flame emitted light so it could not be seen. During this time houses burned to the ground but no one saw the flames. The helplessness was overwhelming for many. They could not be alone with their own thoughts without some distraction to keep them from thinking too much. Most people survived by living a life of distraction without thinking. Anything that kept them from their own thoughts was useful. There was no anchor in their soul to stabilize them, so they tried not to think. Distraction was the key to survival.
But the intense darkness forced them inward, which was frightening since they found nothing there. Just emptiness, loneliness, and nothingness.
Fortunately for Jill, she was at her apartment when the darkness struck. She knew it was coming so she was prepared. She could not get to work, and no news could be broadcast during this judgment. Jill had memorized her small apartment and gathered everything she needed as close as possible. She had stacks of pre-made food and bottles of water alongside her sofa. This enabled very limited movement in order to survive the ordeal. It would not last long, she knew.
Prior to this judgment, Jill had read about it. She knew she would not be able to do anything but sit and wait it out once the darkness hit. She had memorized information related to the judgment.
After two days the darkness was gone. Unbelievers went back to just being extremely hungry and thirsty, and trying not to inflame the constant sores which had remained just as painful. They saw that the believers around them did not have such issues, except that they suffered some degree of privation. But they did not have the sores. The unbelievers began to hate those who had no sores. They themselves could have lost the sores at any time, but they refused to turn to God. From this point on there would be almost no one change their mind about needing God's help. They were totally hardened in their souls.
This is not the last of the darkness which the Antichrist forces will see. There will also be a separate day of total darkness over the entire earth on the day the Lord returns, and that will occur as the world's Alliances are assembled at Armageddon.
Back in Israel, the Western Alliance troops secured Jerusalem as their new base of operations. It would be used by the West for further conquests of African nations. Meanwhile, the Western Alliance forces were angered by what had happened to them in Israel. So they took their revenge on the city of Jerusalem which they had captured. It was as Zechariah had prophesied several thousand years before:
Zechariah 14:1 “A day of the LORD is coming, Jerusalem, when your possessions will be plundered and divided up within your very walls. 2 I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to fight against it; the city will be captured, the houses ransacked, and the women raped. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city.
The Western Alliance forces began to round up Jews inside Jerusalem to be shipped out to concentration camps. The troops needed their homes for themselves since they would be based there. So they stole their houses and food and possessions. A procession of Jewish prisoners several miles long was marched out of the city toward the east for shipment out of Israel to unknown locations.
Armageddon is inevitable at this point. The stage has been set. The world leaders are drunk with power madness and cannot see anything else. They are about to be drawn into the meat grinder they themselves had constructed, and it would be called "Armageddon.”
CHAPTER 29
REMAINING IMPEDIMENTS REMOVED

The accumulation of the Bowls is taking a severe toll, with the painful red sores, the oceans turned to blood and sea life destroyed, drinking blood instead of water, scorching heat, and intense darkness. The unbelievers of the earth are in maximum pain and under extreme stress. But they still refuse to accept the real solution to their problems.
The sixth Bowl Judgment occurred about a month later. Most would miss the point of it, but this judgment would have great impact. It would remove remaining impediments and clear the way for Armageddon.
Israeli Resistance commander General Dayan sees the sixth Bowl coming, and explains it to his staff.  He reads from Revelation 16:12:
“The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East. 13 Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 14 They are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.”
General Dayan continues: "The Bible says the sixth Bowl causes "the Euphrates River to dry up" so the Eastern Alliance can bring its massive military forces across the Arab countries and into Israel in preparation for Armageddon. The "Euphrates" reference is an analogy to removing what has been blocking their advance, namely, the Southern Alliance military forces. We have recently seen the Southern Alliance pulling all its troops out of Iraq, Iran, and neighboring countries so they can be sent toward Israel, and that is happening right now.
Additionally, Southern Alliance forces from the Arabian Peninsula have left the area and are now attacking Western Alliance installations using multiple small engagements which have targeted supply lines. So the movement of Arab military forces out of their own countries clears the way for the Eastern Alliance to move its massive armies straight through the Arab nations, including Iraq which is the location of the Euphrates River. The armies of all four world Alliances will soon be assembled in the Jezreel Valley, at a location which has become known as Armageddon. That is why this sixth Bowl Judgment is important. It is God's purpose and design to pull all the armies of the world together for one final battle."
Back at LANX News, Jill Steiner reads from her book to explain to her audience what is happening:
"Behind this judgment was political influence which stirred up the world leaders to throw caution to the wind and commit their armies to a doomed battle where no one could possibly win. Powerful demons (“frogs”) are sent out by Satan and his two emissaries the Antichrist and the False Prophet to stir up war emotions among the other kings and bring the whole world into one final battle. Satan simply wants everyone dead at this point, and especially the Jews. He has lost all semblance of control. He is mad with rage and lashes out in total fury. This Bowl judgment makes world leaders mad with rage. The four Alliances of the world are drawn together to the Middle East for battle. They do not know why they are going, but they go anyway. They cannot refuse. The Lord has pulled them into a trap. The stage is set for Armageddon, which is the last battle of the Tribulation, and the return of Jesus Christ."
Jill: "We are 30 days from Armageddon."
President Antivon is traveling with his military forces taking personal command of the invasion plans for Africa. He had wanted to take Africa into his domain earlier, but needed to wait until other priority countries were secured, including Israel. Now that Israel is generally in his pocket, and can serve as a base for operations into Africa, he can move along his plans for invading Africa.
But in the meantime, he has a thorn in his side to deal with first.
CHAPTER 30
BABYLON

President Antivon has a grudge to settle. He has become very angry and frustrated over failures to properly promote him as a god, and has also grown weary of his own religious hierarchy taking advantage of his power and using it for their own benefit, and without the reciprocity he believes he deserves. After all, a god must be worshiped properly. But instead, the religious organization he installed at the former Vatican City, which he renamed "Babylon," has failed him. Babylon did not seem to appreciate him, or recognize what they had in him. Now they must pay. He is in a state of extreme rage, and his fits of madness have become legendary with his staff. The price will be very steep for Babylon, and the city of Rome will simply be collateral damage.
Antivon tells his Aide "Get my Ambassador for Religion at Babylon on the line. He has failed me." The Aide recognized that another fit of madness was underway, so he moved quickly.
The last Aide was replaced for being "slow to respond" and no one ever saw him again. The Aide returned having the Ambassador, the head of the religious propaganda machine for Antivon, on the phone.  Ambassador: "Yes Mr. President, what can I.....?"  Antivon cuts him off and simply says: "You have failed me! It is over!" and ends the call. Antivon tells the Aide, get my military staff in here, NOW!" The staff arrives within minutes. Antivon orders them to destroy Rome. "Put a nuke on them.  They are worthless to me!"  One of his Generals protested and Antivon ordered him arrested on the spot. "Anyone else want to disobey orders? Fine, make it happen. Today! Before sundown!" The Generals grimly go out to perform their assigned task, which they see as madness, but are powerless to stop. Antivon turns to his Aide: "I warned the Ambassador for Religion not to fail me. This is on his head."
In LA Jill Steiner is home reading about the city the Bible calls "Babylon." She reads from her book:
Revelation 18:21 “Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said: “With such violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again...24  In her was found the blood of prophets and of God’s holy people, of all who have been slaughtered on the earth.”
"The hurling of the boulder into the sea makes a splash much like a missile with a nuclear warhead makes a mushroom cloud...The end will be violent and total destruction. As the center of power for the Antichrist and the Western Alliance, the city called "Babylon" in the Bible was the envy of all unbelievers everywhere. It has power, wealth, luxury, extreme debauchery, and every form of excess imaginable. It was the very symbol of what most people aspired to achieve, the pinnacle of what the world had to offer. It showed that there was meaning in life, if only to acquire what Babylon had to offer. But as the source of religious power for the Antichrist, Babylon was rotten and morally bankrupt. It was a shadow built on the sands of evil."
Jill decides to call in an expert on such subjects. In the news studio of LANX News, Jill Steiner once again interviews her favorite Professor:
Jill: "We have Professor Heathrow with us again today. Professor Heathrow, you are the Professor of Biblical Ancient Civilization Studies at the University of Southern California. Tell us about ancient Babylon and its relationship to the Biblical Babylon."
Professor Heathrow: "The city called “Babylon” in the Bible is not the literal Babylon of ancient times. The literal ancient Babylon was completely destroyed several hundred years before the Apostle John wrote Revelation, so it no longer existed except in ruins, but its memory was the stuff of legends. The name for the Tribulation city discussed in Revelation was chosen for specific reasons to describe how it would be like ancient Babylon in many ways. Ancient Babylon was the most powerful and richest city of its day, as the Tribulation Babylon would become. Ancient Babylon was the center of a degenerate religious system for a large part of the people on earth during that time, as the Tribulation Babylon has become.
And ancient Babylon was renowned for its total debauchery and every form of carnal excess, as with the Tribulation Babylon. These factors make the name “Babylon” the perfect choice for the name of the analogous city during the Tribulation.
Early Christians called Rome Babylon, and Peter referred to Rome as Babylon in 1 Peter 5:13 “She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings.”  This ties Rome and Babylon together as he sends greetings from Rome.  Rome was the capital of the Roman Empire, which is tied to the Western Alliance which the Bible describes as a sort of "Revived Roman Empire" with many of the same countries which were once part of ancient Rome.  The Babylon of the Tribulation describes Rome as the headquarters of the worldwide religious system of the Antichrist, which Antivon set up in the former Vatican City inside Rome after throwing out the Christian church there.  The Antichrist has used the Christian world-wide infrastructure in Vatican City, now Babylon, to set up a world-wide worship of himself as a god.  So Rome became the center of worship of a false god because there was already an infrastructure in place there, so the former Vatican City and Rome and the new false religious system are now thoroughly interrelated, and that is what the Bible collectively calls Babylon, the combined religious and financial capital of the Western Alliance.  Rome has therefore become the Babylon of the Tribulation, an analogy to the ancient debauched city of Babylon which was destroyed long before the Book of Revelation was written."
Jill: "So you say that Rome is the Babylon of the current day? That would mean Rome will be the target of nuclear destruction, according to the Bible."
Professor Heathrow: "Revelation 17 - 18 uses the analogy of a prostitute riding on a beast to discuss both the city and the religion as if they are one entity when referring to it as either “Babylon” or the “great prostitute” which is Babylon.  Rome has become a center of international trade and wealth, and the seat of religious power for the Antichrist, even though Washington DC is the political center of power.  So it is a place of great importance – political and economic power along with false religion, all combined into a single evil power sphere.
All the nations of the western world look to this city as a source for their own power, and also their wealth. The religion taxes everyone who buys through the Mark of the Beast program. That results in a huge amount of wealth stolen from the people who are forced to buy through the Mark program. The Antichrist's religious system, with himself as the deity, is a major key to his power over his Western Alliance. We will see how the city will be “destroyed in one hour” by “burning”, a clear reference that a nuclear explosion will destroy this great city and all in it. It is significant that it takes three chapters of Revelation to discuss this powerful city which will be the center of such evil and degeneracy as the source of Satan's worldwide religious system."
Jill Steiner: "Professor, how did Rome become Babylon?"
Professor Heathrow continues:
"It became Babylon by presenting the Antichrist as a god, and then making money on that proposition. You see, the Antichrist really sees himself as a god, but the religious support system built around that views it as a money-making opportunity. And the city has grown rich as it has exploited the "god-like" issue. The Antichrist believes he is a god, not that he is god-like. That is a big difference."
"So the Bible portrays Babylon as a prostitute of false religion riding on its State sponsor, the political power of the Antichrist, and further invoking the image of the power behind both of them, who is Satan.  Stated another way, the satanic religious system sits on a “scarlet beast” which is the Revived Roman Empire composed of 10 nations (“horns”) which in ancient times were part of the Roman Empire, and has added the 11th nation led by the Antichrist.  During the early part of the Tribulation the Antichrist used false religion as a tool to gain power, and to control people on a worldwide scale.  The false religion and political State will find each other useful, and their combined exploitative powers will be enhanced by their unholy union. The “blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns” shows. 	"
Jill interjects: "Professor, no disrespect intended, but you are way past our audience's caring about such details. "
Professor Heathrow: "Quite right, so sorry. But I am a geek about this stuff. Let me be more clear. As the Tribulation proceeds, religion will end up thinking it is the important part while the Antichrist believes he is the important part. The Antichrist will grow to despise and resent the upstart religious system which he himself invented. So Satan's own political forces will eventually destroy his religious forces as evil fights evil due to internal struggles, jealousy, and arrogance of power."
"This is the important point for your audience to understand. That the Antichrist will end up destroying “Babylon” by launching a nuclear strike on it. Satan cannot control his own forces of evil or keep them from fighting each other since his plan depends on using the basest instincts of mankind, which can easily get out of control, and are not controllable even by Satan. The Tribulation shows that Satan is not nearly as smart or powerful as he believes he is. Hence, the Tribulation proves that Satan is a bumbling fool."
Jill: "A bumbling fool. All this time most of the world has thought of Satan as a super- powerful super-genius who controlled his empire with precision. But the Tribulation shows him to be incompetent and a failure, right?"
Professor Heathrow: "Exactly. Satan will be revealed as the biggest loser of all time. That is the overall reason for the Tribulation. It will be the ultimate defeat of Satan by God, as he will end up bound in chains and imprisoned in the Abyss."
Jill: "But what about Babylon...why will it be destroyed?"
Professor Heathrow: "Babylon is very much at the center of this union of the prostitute religion and the Antichrist's Revived Roman Empire. The great city Babylon/Rome is the center of trade and also the center of false religion of the Revived Roman Empire for the Antichrist who is King of the West..."
Jill: "Professor, remember that our audience wants to get the short version of why Babylon is destroyed. They do not want to wait for the movie version."
Professor Heathrow: "Of course. We see how the Antichrist eventually turns against the satanic religious system and the city Rome where it will be based. The Antichrist grows to hate the religion even though it gave him great power, because he will grow weary of the demands placed on him by this religion, and also its failure to meet his enormous expectations as a god. Two sides of Satan's evil will fight each other. Satan is not as smart as he believes he is, nor as powerful as he pretends to be. His satanic religious system will be destroyed by his own evil dictator."
Jill adds: "And so, Satan ends up the bumbling fool as his own man the Antichrist destroys Satan's religious system, am I right?"
Professor Heathrow: "That's right. Babylon will be completely destroyed by a combination earthquake and nuclear attack from the Antichrist who was formerly its benefactor."
Jill: "Thank you Professor Heathrow. Your analysis was very informative. Lengthy, but informative"
Professor Heathrow: "I am glad you still have your sense of humor, Jill. Very refreshing, and I appreciate it."
Jill: "So it seems a nuclear explosion will destroy Rome as part of the 7th Bowl Judgment and the city will become uninhabitable due to the nuclear destruction. This is nuclear since it discusses sudden and complete destruction, consumption by fire, can be seen from far off and will occur in “one hour” as discussed in the coming verses. As always, we will bring you the video when it happens."
Jill ends her broadcast day and prepares to depart for home.
Producer Jack Ford: "So Jill, you are a comedian now?"
Jill: "In the Millennium I will be a stand-up comic. Want to be my Producer?"
Jack: "I will always be by your side.”
CHAPTER 31
ROME BURNS

On a ship in the Mediterranean Sea passing the island of Sicily, a container ship Captain is below deck giving final instructions to his crew as they head toward Rome to unload their cargo.  They have just returned from a month-long voyage picking up luxury goods for the elite in Rome. It is a lucrative business, and the clientele in Rome pays very well for his wares. When it comes to commerce, Rome is about the only remaining destination for any luxury goods. The rest of the world is barely surviving, trying to just get a little food and some water. But Rome has continued its excesses on the backs of the rest of the world, getting rich on the taxes taken in through the Mark of the Beast program. The container ship has just rounded the western tip of Sicily is now headed northward. Next stop, Rome.
Just then an enormous sound and wind blast comes across the bow of the ship, and it rocks vigorously.  The windows on the bridge are blown out, and the cargo shifts, leaving the boat listing to the port-side.  The Captain and crew come up out of the hold to the bridge to see a mushroom cloud ahead of them, obviously above Rome.  There was nothing else it could be. The crew collectively gaze in horror to see the sight, and think of the destruction.  The Captain also knows it means ruin for his business.  He invested everything in this cargo.  He is bankrupt.  At least his ship's bow was headed into the explosion, otherwise it would have capsized.  The crew is mostly alive, although the bridge is badly damaged and the crew in it at the time is gone -- blown overboard.  The ship is disabled and listing.  He thinks to himself that given the normal ship traffic, the death toll on the Mediterranean alone must be over 10,000.  But Rome had several million living there.  He decides to stop thinking and see what he can do for his ship and crew.
Ship radio traffic erupts, with emergency distress calls going out everywhere. Ships sank all over the Mediterranean, and many people are in the water. Communications are sketchy, as the EMP radiation has disrupted air-wave communications all over the area. Some web-based communications are operating. But generally there is chaos.
When Jill Steiner awakes the next morning, she learns the news of the destruction of Rome by a nuclear explosion. She hurries into the news studio to prepare for her morning news show. She thinks to herself: "It is all just as the Bible said it would be."
In the studio she describes the destruction of Rome and its aftermath. Producer Jack Ford puts up the video.
Jill: "Babylon, which is Rome, was destroyed today by a nuclear attack. It was targeted by the Western Alliance forces out of Germany. President Antivon gave the orders himself. He is currently on his way to the Middle East to review the military forces there."
Jill reads from her book:
Revelation 18:1 “After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. 2 With a mighty voice he shouted: “‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!’... 8 Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine.  She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her...‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls!  17  In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!’ ”
"The Bible predicted it would be destroyed "in one hour", showing a nuclear conflagration. The nuclear destruction and burning will be seen by those in ships from far off at sea. Those who relied on Babylon for religion and trade will be horrified, and they will mourn for their own loss of economic benefit."
The international trade and excesses of luxury and wealth will vanish in a flash. The false economy created by this false religion will crash. Total economic depression sets in. At this point all semblance of normalcy in the Antichrist’s kingdom vanishes, and all he has left is to wage war on a grand scale.
The people will focus on what they have lost in trade, not on what this means spiritually. Those who benefited from the mark of the Beast will now be bankrupted by it. But they will still refuse to turn to God.
Jill: "The mushroom cloud and smoke were visible from ships all over the north Atlantic Ocean. While the focus for all who saw the destruction was their economic ruin, which was tied to Babylon and its religious system through the Mark of the Beast. They mourn their loss of wealth, but fail to understand why this happened. This is God's judgment for killing believers who refused to accept the satanic false religion and refused to take the mark of the Beast."
Jill continues: "Rome falls silent.  No music, no tradesmen working, no grain being milled, no public utilities, no marriage or social life, no commerce or trade, no worshiping Satan, no more killing of God's believers.  The deceit of Satan's religious system is ended.  Only silence remains in Babylon.  Let us note Revelation 19:3 “And again they shouted: “Hallelujah!  The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever.”  This suggests that the mushroom cloud over Babylon will be immortalized as a monument to the victory of God over false religion."
With the destruction of Babylon and Satan's religious system by the 7th Bowl Judgment, Jesus Christ is now ready to return to earth at His Second Advent, deliver His people who are under siege, destroy the unbeliever armies massed in Israel including at Armageddon, finish the actions needed to start the Millennium, and then assume His rightful place as ruler of the earth during His 1000 year reign.
Within the next week a series of intense earthquakes occurred. The world seemed to be at its end. Unbelievers wished for death but could not find it. The world still refused to look to God as their answer.
CHAPTER 32
INVASION OF NORTH AFRICA

President Antivon is in southern Israel with his troops. He wants to personally oversee the invasion of his next prize, which will be Africa. He sees the Pyramids as part of the energy source for the harmonic convergence of the universe. To him they are aligned in a precise way to collect and disseminate the energy of the universe to a god, and that would be him. As it was for the Pharaohs, so it would be for him. He was their heir. He desperately wanted to "own" the Pyramids, and the rich mineral resources of Africa along with them.
The Western Alliance forces based in Jerusalem headed south into North Africa. The African nations were no match for the combined military forces of the West, and fell easily one by one. Egypt, Sudan, Libya and Ethiopia fell first, all within a week. After a short rest for his troops and new supplies, Antivon was preparing to order his forces further south into central Africa. He felt the power of the Pyramids flowing through him. He was invincible.
But unexpected news of a massive Eastern Alliance army marching west toward the Middle East reached him. At the same time, when the Northern Alliance saw the Eastern Alliance headed for the Middle East, they sent their forces southward to cut them off. The Southern Alliance forces from Middle East countries had already made a surprise advance on Israel, and were now at the border of northern Israel, leaving their own countries undefended. The armies of the world were all headed toward Israel.
Infuriated, Antivon ordered his combined Western Alliance military forces to turn around and head north at full speed to prevent the Northern, Eastern, and Southern Alliances from trapping his army in Africa. His forces drove hard, and within two days the bulk of his forces had exited Africa into southern Israel. The three other Alliances were all within a couple days of entering Israel from various directions, with the Southern Alliance already massed at the border waiting for the proper timing to cross over.
Jill Steiner had been reporting on the invasion of Africa, and now turned to covering the invasion of the Middle East by all four world Alliances. The stage was set for Armageddon. She quotes from the Old Testament:
Daniel 11:40 “[King of the West – Antichrist] will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood. 41 He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon [where Jews are in supernatural hiding] will be delivered from his hand. 42 He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape. 43 He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Cushites in submission. 44  But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many. 45  He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain [Jerusalem]. Yet he [Antichrist] will come to his end, and no one will help him.”
Satellite video shows the armies of the world all headed toward northern Israel. The Western Alliance is headed northward, having just departed from Egypt into southern Israel. The Eastern Alliance is shown headed through northern Iran and about to enter Iraq, while the Northern Alliance is headed south through Turkey and will then make its way through Syria. The Southern Alliance army is in Jordan on the border with Israel, having left their own countries unprotected as the Eastern Alliance storms through. They should all converge within the next few days. The destination for each one of them is northern Israel. They could not attack southern Israel and Jerusalem directly because the Western Alliance is too strong there.
Within the next several days the armies will all meet at the Jezreel Valley in northern Israel to do battle on the wide Plain of Esdraelon, near Megiddo, just south of Nazareth. The valley has become better known by a Hebrew and Greek word compilation combining "har" and "Megiddo," which means the "Hill of Megiddo," forming the word "Armageddon."  The stage is set for the bloodiest battle in all human history.
CHAPTER 33
PREVIEW OF TRUMPET #7 -- WOE #3

With Armageddon and the Second Advent of Christ close at hand, Jill Steiner is in her news studio telling her audience what is coming next.
Jill: "Six Bowl Judgments and six Trumpet Judgments have been completed. There are seven of each, so one Bowl and one Trumpet remain. Recall that the first six Bowls were inserted in between the sixth and seventh Trumpet Judgments, which is the “Third Woe” which is yet to come. The Third Woe includes events just prior to and during the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. So the Third Woe includes the last Trumpet and last Bowl. In other words, all that remains is the Grand Finale, a combination of the seventh Bowl and seventh Trumpet Judgments."
After a brief pause Jill adds "I can't believe I just said all of that."
Jill continues: "The armies of the world have gathered to attempt to destroy Israel and the Jews, but instead have ended up facing each other at Armageddon. It is at this point when the Lord will return. The Second Advent is not so much a single event as a series of events which occur as Jesus Christ returns and completes the task of cleansing the earth from evil in preparation for His rule during the Millennial Kingdom. His first task will be to destroy the assembled armies which have invaded Israel.  Jesus Christ will very soon return to earth at His Second Advent, deliver His people who are under siege in Israel, destroy the armies of the four Alliances which are massed at Armageddon, and then assume His rightful place as Ruler of the earth."
Jill introduces her studio guest: "I have invited Professor Heathrow, Professor of Biblical Ancient Civilization Studies at the University of Southern California, to explain what the Bible says is about to happen during this Grand Finale. Welcome back to the program. Professor Heathrow, according to the Book of Revelation, Armageddon is only days away. Tell our audience what to expect next."
Professor Heathrow: "I described the timing issue on your show over 3 years ago, so let us review.  The Bible tells us the Tribulation is seven years long consisting of two equal sections, each exactly 1260 days long.  Bible years do not match our current calendar years, since the ancients measured years by the moon, and a year was 360 days long, which was twelve complete moon cycles.  Of course, our solar years are 365 days plus one extra day every four years.  So 3 1/2 moon-years is 360 x 3.5 which is 1260 days.  But days are days, and the Bible says the Tribulation will last 2 x 1260 equals 2520 days.  That is 37 days short of seven solar years, since we had 2 leap years since the Vanishment.  Therefore in solar years the Tribulation will last a total of 6 years 10 months and 24 days.  That means the Second Advent of Jesus Christ is just 5 days away.  And Armageddon happens when the Lord returns."
Jill: "So Professor, we are just 5 days from Armageddon?"
Professor Heathrow: "Correct. Five days and no more. We will start with an overview of what leads up to Armageddon and the Second Advent, and then cover the supporting verses from the Bible in detail to understand why we know these things. Jesus Christ will return to earth when Satan's four human armies are amassed in Israel, forming a battle line from the north at Armageddon, going southeast along the Jordan River Valley into southern Jordan, and extending back over to Jerusalem and into southern Israel. These armies are intending to destroy each other, and also the Jewish believers in Israel. At the northernmost part of the battle line in north Israel is Armageddon (aka the Plain of Megiddo, Esdraelon, or Valley of Jezreel) where the bulk of the four armies will be located."
"In southern Israel the Jewish believers are fighting the Antichrist's forces. Some Israeli Resistance troops in Jerusalem will be cut off and in danger of being annihilated, but the Lord will cover the Antichrist forces with supernatural darkness for the last hours prior to the Second Advent, preventing the destruction of the Jewish believers fighting against him. This will be the second time this darkness is used by the Lord to create an impenetrable darkness where artificial lights will be of no use, so the unbeliever armies and their sophisticated weapons of war, many of which rely on using the electromagnetic spectrum such as fiber optics, microwave, GPS and other technologies, will be immobilized by it. Then the whole world will be darkened during the last day, and while it is still dark, without warning there will be blinding light and angelic trumpets, and the Lord returns to deliver His people who are in great jeopardy."
"Jesus Christ first comes down to southern Israel (Judah) to defend the Jewish believers there, since they are in the most danger once the supernatural darkness is lifted by the Second Advent. Then He will go to Jerusalem and literally stand on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem and split it in half with an earthquake, allowing the Jewish remnant of believers fighting in Jerusalem to escape using the newly formed valley through the middle of the Mount of Olives. As the Jewish believers are empowered by the Lord, they begin to wipe out the unbeliever armies in southern Israel, then these Jewish fighters come to the aid of those fighting in Jerusalem. The Lord also brings panic and confusion on the enemy forces, causing them to turn on each other. Once southern Israel and Jerusalem are secure, the Lord proceeds to work His way up from the south, wiping out the unbeliever armies amassed all along the Jordan border with Israel where the Jewish believers who had fled at the Midpoint of the Tribulation are in hiding.  He then goes up along the Jordan River, wiping out the forces massed along it. Finally, the Lord attacks the unbeliever armies of the four kings at Armageddon where they have gathered to fight each other."
"Upon seeing the Lord, these four armies stop fighting each other and turn instead to fight against Him. At that point they are annihilated by a single word from the mouth of Jesus Christ, the world war ends, and all Tribulation Bowl and Trumpet Judgments are complete. All elect angels and resurrected believers from Heaven ride along with Him, but do not participate in the destruction. The Lord needs no help, although He allows the Jewish believers fighting in and around Jerusalem to have their victory over the unbeliever armies which had sacked Jerusalem. The end of the world war sets the stage for Jesus Christ to claim His rightful position as ruler of the earth from Satan who usurped the position at the fall of Adam in the Garden of Eden.
Jill: "What are some of the supporting Bible verses for what you just described will happen?"
Professor Heathrow continues: "Daniel 11 reveals some of the maneuvering of the four Tribulation armies of the North, South, East, and West, which will all converge on the Middle East, and Israel in particular, to attempt to kill the Jews and fight the Lord as He returns:
Daniel 11:40 “At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him [the King of the West – Antichrist] in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him [the Antichrist] with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He [the Antichrist is now every “he”, “him” and “his” in these verses] will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood. 41 He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon [where Jews are in supernatural hiding] will be delivered from his hand. 42  He will extend his power over many countries... 44  But reports from the east and the north will alarm him [the other three Alliance armies advancing toward Israel], and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many. 45 He will pitch his royal tents between the seas and the beautiful holy mountain [Jerusalem]. Yet he [the Antichrist] will come to his end, and no one will help him.”
"Then the Book of Joel describes the return of the Lord and the destruction of the four armies massed at Armageddon:"
Joel 3:11 “Come quickly, all you nations from every side, and assemble there. Bring down your warriors, LORD! 12 “Let the nations be roused; let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat [near Jerusalem], for there I will sit to judge all the nations on every side. 13 Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, trample the grapes, for the winepress is full and the vats overflow—so great is their wickedness!” 14 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD [Second Advent] is near in the valley of decision. 15 The sun and moon will be darkened, and the stars no longer shine [on the day of the Second Advent].
Professor Heathrow continues: "As we have seen, just prior to the Second Advent there will be supernatural darkness over the entire earth. This worldwide darkness follows the darkness covering only the Antichrist's empire and military forces caused by the 5th Bowl Judgment."
Jill interjects to Professor Heathrow: "Professor, what does the Book of Revelation say specifically about the return of the Lord and Armageddon?"
Professor Heathrow: "Some of the important verses are as follows:"
Revelation 19:11 “I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war.”
"During the Second Advent of Christ, Jesus Christ returns as a Warrior-King to deliver His people, eliminate the degeneracy on the earth, further avenge the killing of believers during the Tribulation, and establish His Millennial Kingdom on earth. As Jesus said in the Book of Matthew, everyone on earth will see His coming:"
“For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 28  Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.  29  Immediately after the distress of those days “‘the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’ 30  Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven [after total darkness]. And then all the peoples [unbelievers] of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. 31  And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect [dead Old Testament and Tribulation believers resurrected] from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.”
"Zechariah 14 covers the battle in and around Jerusalem which is ongoing when the Lord returns.  The Israeli Resistance will be fighting the forces of the Antichrist.  The battle will not be going well for the Resistance fighters, and the Lord will turn that around:"
"Zechariah says: "Then the LORD will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights on a day of battle. 4  On that day [Second Advent] his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south. 5 You [believer Jews in Jerusalem] will flee by my mountain valley [pathway newly formed by the earthquake], for it will extend to Azel [outside Jerusalem city limits]. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come [Second Advent], and all the holy ones with him [all believers in resurrection bodies, and all elect angels]. 6 On that day there will be neither sunlight nor cold, frosty darkness. 7  It will be a unique day—a day known only to the LORD—with no distinction between day and night [supernatural darkness]. When evening comes, there will be light [at the return of Christ]. 	12
This is the plague with which the LORD will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. 13 On that day [Second Advent] people will be stricken by the LORD with great panic. They will seize each other by the hand and attack one another. 14 Judah [Jewish believers from outside Jerusalem] too will fight at Jerusalem.”
Professor Heathrow continues: "Zechariah prophesied about the Second Advent and how the very first act of the Lord will be to help the Jews fighting in southern Israel (Judah), followed by deliverance of the Jewish believers trapped in Jerusalem. As a result these Jews will become empowered to defeat the attacking army of the Antichrist during the time of the Second Advent:"
“Then the LORD will appear over them; his arrow will flash like lightning. The Sovereign LORD will sound the trumpet; he will march in the storms of the south, 15 and the LORD Almighty will shield them. They will destroy and overcome with slingstones. They will drink and roar as with wine; they will be full like a bowl used for sprinkling the corners of the altar. 16 The LORD their God will save his people on that day.”
"The Jewish believers in southern Israel will fight with extreme enthusiasm as the Lord shields them and also brings panic and confusion on the unbeliever armies. The Jewish forces are enabled by the Lord to accomplish incredible feats of daring, bravery, and skill as warriors. They will destroy the enemy outside Jerusalem, then will go do the same in Jerusalem. The Lord could do this Himself, but He allows the Jewish believers to have their own victory over their oppressors who have killed so many of their friends and compatriots.
Revenge belongs to the Lord, but He sometimes shares it for specific purposes. Zechariah continues:"
“The LORD, who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the human spirit within a person, declares: 2 “I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem. 3 On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves. 4  On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness,” declares the LORD. “I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations [supernatural darkness]. 5 Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the LORD Almighty is their God.’ 6  “On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume all the surrounding peoples right and left, but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place. 7 “The LORD will save the dwellings of Judah first [first act of the Second Advent is in southern Israel outside of Jerusalem], so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem’s inhabitants may not be greater than that of Judah [those Jewish believers in southern Israel but outside Jerusalem]. 8 On that day the LORD will shield those who live in Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD going before them [Jewish believers will be fierce warriors]. 9 On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem.”
"And finally Isaiah talks about Armageddon:"
Isaiah 34:1 “Come near, you nations, and listen; pay attention, you peoples! Let the earth  hear, and all that is in it, the world, and all that comes out of it! 2 The LORD is angry with all nations; his wrath is on all their armies. He will totally destroy them, he will give them over to slaughter. 3 Their slain will be thrown out, their dead bodies will stink; the mountains will be soaked with their blood. 4  All the stars in the sky will be dissolved and the heavens rolled up like a scroll [nuclear warfare among the four Kings' armies]; all the starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine, like shriveled figs from the fig tree. 5  My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; see, it descends in judgment on Edom [western Jordan], the people I have totally destroyed [where enemy armies are massed along the Jordan River Valley]...6 For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom [both located along the Jordan River Valley]...8 For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of retribution, to uphold Zion’s cause.”
Professor Heathrow:  "Isaiah goes on to say: “Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah [southeast of the Dead Sea in Jordan], with his garments stained crimson? [The Lord has annihilated the armies massed along the Jordan border with Israel] Who is this, robed in splendor, striding forward [to finish the task at Armageddon] in the greatness of his strength? “It is I [Jesus Christ at Second Advent], proclaiming victory, mighty to save.” 2 Why are your garments red, like those of one treading the winepress? 3 “I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath; their blood spattered my garments, and I stained all my clothing. 4  It was for me the day of vengeance; the year for me to redeem had come 	6 I trampled the nations in my anger; in my wrath I made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground.”
Professor Heathrow continues: "And finally from Joel again:"
Joel 3:16 The LORD will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem [during Second Advent]; the earth and the heavens will tremble. But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.”
"From these Old Testament passages we can piece together the path the Lord will take during the Second Advent.  There are probably at least 100 million unbelievers engaged in these battles when the Lord returns, and they will all be killed, starting with the Antichrist's forces in southern Israel (Judah) outside of Jerusalem, then those in and around Jerusalem, followed by the enemies of Israel massed along the Jordan border southeast of the Dead Sea (Bozrah), then finally the remainder at Armageddon.  The Lord accomplishes most of the slaughter of the unbeliever armies, but also empowers believer Jews to fight and defeat their enemies, especially in southern Israel (Judah) and around Jerusalem."
