Kiran hopped onto his quacycle and gestured to a space behind him. Gatril carefully climbed on and held onto Kiran’s waist. “I’ve never rode one of these things before.”
“Don’t worry,” Kiran said. “I’m an expert.”
“…Why don’t I feel confident in what you’re saying?” Gatril said dryly.
Kiran chuckled and turned on the engine. Steam spewed from the tubes, and he rode out of the city of trees. 
It wasn’t uncommon for monsters to be seen outside of their wild habitats, however people took care to avoid the beasts, even though they possessed the intelligence to communicate. Kiran and Gatril left the thinning jungle and came upon a small grassy plain, inhabited by gazelles, wild boars and zebras.
Gatril licked her lips as she seized up the animals. “I could eat one of those right now…”
“Focus,” said Kiran. “We need to keep an eye out for predators too.”
“That’s what I’m doing,” Gatril said. “Don’t start lecturing me, human. Beasts know more about the wild than any man.”
Kiran rolled his eyes and acquiesced to her statement. Then, within his fied of vision, Kiran caught something in the distance, and pointed to it. “Look over there!”
Gatril turned her gaze towards the west, where in the distance she could make out a cluster of tall buildings, almost hidden beneath the looming mountains. “That’s Cronbark,” she said. “It’s one of the cities in the Tatanui kingdom, isn’t it?”
“Yeah,” said Kiran, looking aspiringly at the constructs. “That’s where I’ll go and register once I’ve gathered my spells.” He giggled. “I can’t wait!”
It was over two hours later when they finally made it to their destination; a plain of bare earth covered in scattered bushes, trees and rocks. This allowed for loose soil, the perfect kind for a lamia to burrow through
Kiran said, “Here we are,” and he and Gatril got off their transport. Kiran parked the quacycle near a tree under the shade, then checked his cannon once more, as well as the ammunitions. He fitted his staff in the small sheath on his backpack as well as the necessary jars from the trolley inside it.
After watching him go through all of this, Gatril said, “So how do you plan on tracking down the lamia?”
“Well,” Kiran hesitated for a while, “Lamia are beasts, so they have human intelligence, but still live like animals. It’s a reptile, so it needs to be somewhere cool to bring down its metabolism.”
“You’re almost correct,” said Gatril. “When hunting beasts, you should take care to study what they like. Lamia of a young age can’t breed as yet, so they don’t produce much queex. They love to eat rabbits, deer, wild boars and humans. Humans don’t have fur, scales, feathers, horns or claws, so they’re easier to swallow. They usually come to the surface to warm up, because they’re cold blooded, unlike us bosdrakes. That’s when they’re most vulnerable.”
“Sure,” said Kiran. “So it's best to look for them in the day?”
“Yes,” Gatril said. “Midday to be exact. A lamia will usually climb high out of reach to get warm before slithering back into its burrow.”
“Then we just wait until the sun’s high in the sky before we search then,” Kiran said.
Gatril said, “Right. And in the meantime,” she lifted her skirt, exposing her wet vagina, “let’s have some fun with that mouth of yours.”

After having pleasure Gatril, she and Kiran found themselves a tree to climb and get a wider view of their surroundings. While Kiran looked from pair of binoculars, Gatril used her sharp eyes to scoured the land for any sign of their target.
Apart from the grazing animals and a pack of wild dogs that had marched by, they spotted nothing close to what they were after. Even after it had past twelve in the afternoon, and the sun scorched everything below, the pair didn’t see a hint of a lamia. 
But an hour later, their patience was rewarded.
“I see it…” said Kiran, smiling brightly.
“I see one too,” said Gatril.
In Kiran’s sight he saw the long, dark green body of something slithering across the ground. Then it suddenly reared up on its thick legs and trotted towards a tree. The one Gatril looked at had a color closer to brown, making its way towards a rock. 
“How can we tell the gender?” said Kiran. “I need the queex specifically.”
“Just look at the face,” said Gatril. “But I can also tell by smell. These are both male. Males usually share the same territory, travelling in gangs. Females live by themselves, so we should look elsewhere.”
“Okay,” said Kiran.
They both waited until a few more males came out, scattered around the plain, until they got down and made for the quacycle. They were about to get on their transportation when something sped out of the bushes at them. A massive leopard.
Kiran screamed and fumbled for his gun, but his dragon companion roared and launched herself into the ferocious feline. They growled and snarled as they tousled on the ground in a heap of thrashing limbs and tails, trying to find a mortal opening on the other as Kiran frantically tried to find a chance for himself to take a shot. Finally Gatril’s jaws found the leopard’s neck and she sank her teeth into its flesh.
Blood ran from the wound, and the leopard’s flailing grew less intense. Gatril stood and wiped her mouth. The big cat was dead on the ground. 
“Are you alright?” Kiran said. 
Gatril knelt over the leopard and inspected it. “I’m fine,” she said. She took out her knife and began cutting open the cat. Kiran saw the scratches on her skin, but little blood. Dragon skin was known for being very resistant after all.
