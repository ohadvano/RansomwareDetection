“I'm sorry that I was put next to you. I don't want to cramp your style or anything.”
He's hot and he's got a sense of humour!
“It's fine honestly. I work better on my own but I'm not against helping people to catch up.”
“I promise not to piss you off too much then.” He smirks at me. “But seriously, please tell me if I do because I sort of don't have any friends.”
“I'm quite a patient person so I can take anything.” I clear my throat and take out a pen. I realize Max doesn't have anything in front of him, so I take out a pen and a few pieces of paper for him.
“Cheers.” He takes the pen out of my hand and writes the date on top of the paper.
“So, what brings you to Small Town?”
He doesn't answer me straight away, he finishes writing, puts the pen down and looks at me.
“My mother and I moved here from the States. My mother's job transferred her here and here we are.”
