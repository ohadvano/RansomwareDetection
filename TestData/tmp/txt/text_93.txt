I slowly reach up with my hand and carefully place my hand on Bane's shoulder. The second it makes contact, his eyes immediately swing to me and stares motionless at me.
“Bane?” I whisper.
He stares at me but remains silent. I lean in closer. “Bane?”
“I'm....try...trying.....to control..my...myself.”He grunts. “Do you need me to do anything? Do you need some air?”
“One more word and I'll shift. Leave me the hell alone.” He growls and rushes out of the classroom so fast hardly anyone notices his absence.
Leaning back in my seat, Kellan turns away from Ryder and Silver. I notice the three of them frowning when they realize that Bane is nowhere to be seen.
“Where's Bane?”
Ryder rounds my desk, leans down to me and snaps, “What the hell did you say to him to make him run off like that?”
I didn't expect this kind of response from Ryder. “Excuse me? You think I'm the reason he's gone?”
