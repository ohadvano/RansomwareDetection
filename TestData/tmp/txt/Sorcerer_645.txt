“Just my queex, right?” Gatril crept closer to Kiran. She sunk her finger into her crotch and stirred the center. Kiran’s body jittered, and blood flooded his crotch. “If you want my queex, young sorcerer, there’s only one way to get it.”
Kiran’s mouth opened and a hissing exhaled came out. He couldn’t take his eyes off Gatril’s vagina as she spread the lips of it and stuck her finger inside. “I’ve never done this before…” he repeated.
“Don’t worry,” said Gatril. “I’ll show you.” She took her hand from between her legs and brought it to Kiran’s nose, jarring him with the pungent smell of fresh onion and roasted turkey. She stuck her fingers in the boy’s mouth, tickling his tongue with them. Kiran savored the taste, and his penis throbbed rhythmically.
Gatril took her fingers out of his mouth as she smiled mischievously. “If you want a woman’s queex, you must do it the right way.”
Gatril laid on her back and opened her legs. “Come, young sorcerer.”
This is it now, Kiran thought as he bent over and grabbed her thighs. This is how I lose my virginity. Well, It’s not like she’s ugly. I guess I just have to enjoy the ride.
Kiran took a deep sniff, absorbing the fragrance in his lungs. He tickled her vulva with his tongue, sending electrifying ripples up her stomach. She grabbed his breasts of if the hold her body steady. Kiran wagged his tongue inside her until he found the bud of flesh. With long, deep strokes of his muscular appendage Kiran produced more stimulation. Gatril uttered soft moans and closed her eyes, kneading her breast to assuage the overwhelming desire for satisfaction within her. All the while Kiran’s penis throbbed painfully, yearning for its own release.
Gatril got moister inside. “…Yes…that’s a good boy…”
Kiran lapped up the fluids, still going further and further. Minutes passed and the sensation grew stronger inside Gatril along with her moans. Her body writhed as the contracting waves between her legs strengthened.
“Kiran…I think…I think I feel it cumming!”
Kiran reached for a bowl and placed it beneath her. He made strong sucking motions, until finally she came.
The discharge was equivalent to a burst artery, spewing a huge amount of strong smelling, viscous fluid into Kiran’s mouth. He quickly spat it into the bowl along with the rest that poured from her.
The small bowl was filled halfway, but more than what Kiran was expecting. “Whoa!” he said.
Gatril relaxed and caught her breath. She became so comfortable that she almost went to sleep. But there was more to be done. 
She got up and exhaled. “Phew! Okay. Now it’s my turn.” Gatril went on her hands and knees, exposing her rear to the boy. 
Kiran’s face lit up gloriously, and he went and caressed her rump, giving it soft kisses. He licked the excess wetness from between her ass and buried his face in it. 
“Hurry up,” said Gatril. 
“Y-Yeah.” Kiran stooped, leveling his waist with her bottom. Gatril bent her tail over her back to allow him ease of access. Kiran pulled back the foreskin of his manhood and bumped the tip against Gatril, feeling her muscles tense just a little.
“Slowly now,” Gatril giggled. “You might hurt yourself.”
Kiran slowly entered her, feeling the squeeze of Gatril’s warm wetness. He winced and moaned softly. 
“Good work,” said Gatril. “You’re no longer a virgin. Now, start pounding. Slowly.”
Kiran cocked back his hip and swung inward, delivering his first thrust; a brief burst of sweetness. Kiran continued to do so until Gatril sunk into the flow of things, closing her eyes and moaning along with her human consort.
As the minutes passed, Kiran increased his speed and power. Both he and Gatril winced and clenched their fists.
“That’s it!” she said. “Faster…faster…”
Kiran closed his eyes as his moans grew louder, and before he knew it, he pulled out, spurting a thick jet of white fluid over Gatril’s head and onto the wall. He let out a deep, long sigh. Kiran’s body shuddered spasmodically. The painful throbs had become pleasurable contractions that dripped his semen each time.
Gatril lay on her chest and crossed her arms beneath her head. Kiran staggered to his feet, careful not to trip over his belongings. He sat back against the wall and wiped the tip of his penis, folding it back into his pants. “That was amazing!”
Gatril lifted her head, rolled on her back and sat up. “Not bad for your first time. Especially your tongue.”
Kiran blushed and looked away. “A few prostitutes live near me. They used to talk about how they like it to be done.”
“Really?” Gatril laughed. “I can’t believe it. Just word of mouth thought you? You’re a really good listener.”
Kiran got up, looking down at Gatril as if he knew her all along. “So,” Kiran was a bit hesitant with his words, “what does this make us now?”
“Hmm. Let’s just leave it at friends with benefits,” said Gatril.
Kiran nodded. “Yeah. Sure.” He looked around at the floor. “Well, I better start working on my spell now.”
While Gatril wiped herself, Kiran took the bowl and poured its contents into a clear jar. He took up two other jars and fetched the spell book. Along with the vaginal fluids of a bosdrake, he needed a little sulphur and powdered mango seed. Once he got the substances together, Kiran mixed them around in the jar.
Gatril sat and watched Kiran at work, wondering who his grandfather was, and also about Kiran’s profession and future. Not many beasts had the opportunity to see the intricacies of how humans developed their society.
When the queex began to take on a gelatinous form, Kiran took it out of the jar and placed it in his hands. He rolled it together until it hardened into a white, discolored orb.
