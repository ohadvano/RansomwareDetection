Sugar throws off the calcium-phosphorous balance, and disrupts the entire

important phase of your body machinery. Because refined sugar has been robbed of the B

vitamins that are necessary for its assimilation by the body, it latches on to these wherever

it finds them - namely, in your digestive tract, so that the person who eats refined sugar is

bound to be short on the B vitamins. Result? Nervousness, skin troubles, digestive

trouble, and a host of other disorders which lead to much more serious problems later on.

The more sugar you eat, the lower your body's resistance to disease becomes. To

have good health we must have a strong immune system. Sugar lowers our body's

immune system, making it weak instead of strong. In our body we have white blood cel s,

which are cal ed warrior cel s. These attack and destroy bacteria. However, when we eat

refined sugar, it causes our white blood cel s to become sluggish, causing them to lose

their ability to destroy as many bacteria.

In a healthy body, where no refined sugar is eaten, one white blood cel can destroy

14 bacteria. If a person then eats 12 teaspoons of sugar (a 12 oz. bottle of Cola has 10

teaspoons), one of their white blood cel s wil only be able to destroy 5.5 bacteria. If a

person eats 24 teaspoons of sugar (a banana split has 25 teaspoons of sugar), one of

their white blood cel s wil only be able to destroy 1 bacteria. This weakening effect on the

white blood cel usual y lasts for approximately 5 hours. To keep our body's immune

system strong, we must leave sugar alone.



Refined sugar drains out the mineral salts of the blood, bones, and tissues. It

causes hyperactivity and dental caries. It causes obesity, diabetes, low blood sugar, high

blood pressure, duodenal ulcers, fatty livers, coronary and vascular disease, gout,

dermatitis, and cancer. According to the American Journal of Hypertension (3:560-562,

1990), sucrose (sugar) intake may increase the blood pressure. Other studies have

indicated that the intake of refined carbohydrates produces an increase in the blood

pressure.

WHAT ABOUT HONEY?



Honey is not a disaccharide like sugar; it is a

monosaccharide which does not over-stimulate the

pancreas. Sugar, which comes from beets or cane, is

sucrose, a disaccharide, which over-stimulates the

pancreas. Sugar also must undergo digestion, a process

that changes it into simple sugar; whereas, honey is pre-

digested and takes a load of work off the stomach and

pancreas.



Honey is refined by the bees, whereas sugar is

refined by man under less than ideal conditions, for man is

not as careful or as diligent as the honey bee. Bees have to

col ect nectar from nearly two mil ion flower blossoms to

produce just one pound of honey. Bees are faithful and

diligent in their work of making honey. Of course, pure

organic raw honey is better than what you buy at the local



167

grocery store. Raw honey wil in a short time crystal ize because it has not been heated to

a high temperature and had al the enzymes destroyed. Honey also has more vitamins

and minerals than sugar. (See chart for comparison)

America has become addicted to sugar. The average per person consumption in

the U.S. is almost 135 pounds a year! Americans may be thought of as meat and potato

eaters, but the average per person consumption of red meat is only 111 pounds per year,

and of potatoes only 123 pounds per year.

Increasingly more Americans, however, are becoming aware of the danger in sugar

consumption; and for some time now, the public has been exploring sweet alternatives.

How safe are these artificial sweeteners? We are al familiar with the fact that some of

these artificial sweeteners have been associated with cancer. I wil merely give current

information on one of these sweeteners.



SWEETENER LINKED TO CONFUSION AND MEMORY LOSS



Aspartame, the artificial sweetener widely used in diet soda and food, may cause

confusion and memory loss in some people. This finding came from a study of 551 people

who had severe reactions to aspartame, which is marketed under the brand name of

NutraSweet. HJ. Roberts, director of the Palm Beach Institute for Medical Research in

Florida, found that 157 of the participants had major problems. Eleven lost vision in one or

both eyes; one-third suffered from severe dizziness; half reported severe headaches. One

18 year-old male, who drank about two quarts of aspartame-sweetened diet soda daily,

could not find his way home in his own neighborhood. Severe reactions to the sweetener

occurred three times more often in women. Although the Food and Drug Administration

has received hundreds of complaints about aspartame from consumers, no adequate

studies have been conducted. (New Scientist, 2/18/88).



WHAT CAN WE USE THEN INSTEAD OF SUGAR?

Use natural sugar just as the Good Lord put it in the food, such as fresh peaches,

strawberries, cherries, watermelon, etc. A more concentrated natural sugar would be

found in dates, figs, raisins, dried fruits, honey, etc.

TESTIMONIALS TO

NATURAL HEALTH LIFESTYLE



At every session of our lifestyle center we were thril ed to see lives changed to the

glory of God; we saw individuals make an about face in their lifestyle, and begin their

journey on the path of abundant health and happiness. At the end of every session our

guests testified to the value of our program in their lives. Many of them write testimonials

which are published in our newsletters. The fol owing stories are about some of these

guests who have given permission to print their stories. However, to protect their privacy,

the names have been changed.



FORMER LIFESTYLE GUEST DISCONTINUES HIS DAILY 125 MG. OF

MORPHINE.



Len Dyer (not his real name) and his wife attended our 26- day lifestyle session.

Len came to us with an advanced stage of prostate cancer. In the past, Len had

undergone surgery, radiation and chemotherapy and there was nothing more the doctors

could do except give him morphine for the pain. For the past year Len had been taking

125 mg. of morphine daily. Len's wife had contacted me by phone and I had started Len

on our program while he was at home as we couldn't take him immediately.

With the skil ful use of God's eight natural remedies of fresh air, pure soft water,

natural food, rest, exercise, sunshine, temperance, and trust in God, Len was able to

completely discontinue his morphine. Slowly his strength and digestion improved and

thoughts became clearer. He stil had some bad days but overal he was improving.

After his stay here, he went home looking and feeling much better. We I decided to

cal him and see how he was doing. It had been over six weeks since we had talked to

him. He is stil not using any morphine and is slowly recovering with occasional bad days.

Len is thankful he had the opportunity to attend one of our sessions and learn the natural

ways to good health.



RONALD'S STORY



Ronald Flood (not his real name) from Puerto Rico attended our 26-day lifestyle

session. After hearing about our program from a friend who was a previous client. Ronald

was a successful businessman and the owner of 10 jewelry stores; but now at the age of

48, major health problems brought him seeking relief to our center.

Until 11/2 years ago, Ronald had been a heavy drinker. He had undergone a gal

bladder operation, and was having liver problems. He was retaining fluid, especial y in his

feet. His arms and legs would fal asleep at night; and he had swel ing of the lymph glands

in his neck. Ronald also had real problems with digestion, having only two or three bowel

movements a week. He always felt tired, and realized he needed help.

Ronald was accustomed to eating lots of meat, and drinking lots of milk, coffee,

colas, and tea; but he readily accepted his new pure vegetarian diet. This diet, high in



169

fresh fruits and vegetables, permitted no meats, milk, eggs, sugar, oil, baking powder, or

soda, preservatives, or chemicals.

At the end of the 26 day session, Ronald felt like a new man. He felt so good, and

had so much energy, that during his stay he walked 65 1/2 miles, biked 10 miles, and

helped us here with mowing the lawn, washing windows, etc. His arms and legs no longer

fel asleep at night; and he was no longer retaining fluid. The swel ing in his lymph glands

was gone, and his digestion problems were over, He was having two bowel movements

daily now instead of the previous two or three a week. He lost 91/2 pounds, and he had a

blood pressure reading of 98/58, and a pulse of 68.

Before leaving us, Ronald told us that he was going to sel his jewelry stores, and

possibly open up a health food store or bakery; he wanted to share with others how to

become healthy.



ARTYâ€™S STORY



The phone rang in the office, and we hurried to answer it. We were between

sessions and already almost booked to capacity. This time the cal er was a woman from

overseas would I have space for her husband who was desperately il ? As we talked with

her we learned that he had been diagnosed with cancer and was very discouraged. We

assured her that there was space, and thus Artie and his wife Joan (not their regular

names) became a part of our next family group here at the center.

Through other cal s from friends of Arty's who had attended our lifestyle sessions

we learned a little more about him. Arty, we were told, used to be a robust, active man

with a cheery disposition and an outgoing personality. Diagnosed with cancer, he had

recently returned from attending a different lifestyle center here in the United States. He

was fol owing a good health plan, and should be improving, yet he seemed instead to be

getting worse. His friends said that he was losing weight at an alarming rate.

Our first meeting with Artie and his wife confirmed what our cal ers had said. Artie

was very depressed; he seemed fearful, discouraged, and uncertain about the program he

was fol owing. We assured him that the program was accurate, and proceeded to counsel

him and give him therapy. He immediately joined our other session guests in our program

of exercise and diet as described throughout the pages of this book. Artie and his wife left

our center different people: Artie had gained weight; his cheery smile had returned; his

painful symptoms had disappeared; and he was testifying to the goodness of God. One

year later, he is stil improving, and has returned to his usual program of activity, faithful y

fol owing the natural lifestyle program.

VACCINATIONS



Should we take vaccinations? The answer is no! Vaccinations are not a natural

way to stay healthy. Vaccinations are a disease-producing process, which results in injury

to the bodyÅ› organs, nervous system, blood stream, etc. The immunization program has

been based on PasteurÅ› germ theory. It is frequently overlooked that Pasteur changed

his thinking before his death.



VACCINATIONS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE



Vaccine making is an ever changing and highly experimental process. Even the

vaccine manufactures admit that vaccines are unpredictable in their effects, unstable in

nature, and are unreliable in use, and never safe. Consequently, no one real y knows just

what is being shot into his or her arm, and what it wil do. One shot could possibly cause

sudden death, paralysis, lockjaw, brain-damage, or in some cases there may be no

reaction at al for months or years. The one administering the shot never tel s you what is

in the vaccine. In fact, many doctors do not even know what chemicals, drugs or other

dangerous substances are in the vaccine serums. Lets take a close look at just four of the

many vaccines that are being used today.



SMALL POX VACCINE



â€œA calf is tied down to an operating table, the stomach is shaved from twelve to

fifteen inches square and about one hundred incisions are made. Into these incisions one

drop of glycerinated lymph, (a culture of smal pox passed through a solution of glycerine)

is al owed to drop in and is thoroughly rubbed in. Fever sets in, and the animal becomes

exceedingly sick. In a few days the vesicles appear, the scabs form, and the elimination

of impurities of various kinds from the blood of the calf begins in the form of pus, which is

thrown out of the blood into the vesicles. At the end of six days the process of elimination

has proceeded so far that the vesicles are ful of putrid cel s, etc., and a scab has formed

over the reservoir of disease. The calf is once more bound and laid upon the operating

table. The inoculated area is washed with water and each vesicle is clasped with clamps

separately. The crust is careful y scrapped with the edge of a steel instrument and the

dead skin, lymph, poisonous pus and blood are exuded and are transferred to a smal

crucible.



To this toxic mass of putrid matter is added an equal measure of glycerine, and the

mass is then thoroughly stirred and mixed by a smal electric motor. As soon as it is

rendered homogeneous, it is placed in another crucible and passed through a very fine

sieve, in order to remove the coarse pieces of rotten flesh, hair, etc. Then the mixture is

again stirred and thoroughly mixed, transferred to tubes and distributed through out the

country as pure calf lymph. Today most places in the world have banned smal pox

vaccinations, however the U.S. military medical authorities continue to make smal pox

vaccine and apparently use it on enlisted personal.



171





DIPHTHERIA VACCINE



â€œA horse is prepared for blood sapping (as they cal it) by a course of gradual

poisoning with the throat excretions of patients who are suffering from diphtheria. The

poison is administered only a little at the first injection, but day by day the dose is

increased until the limit is reached. That is when the horse is diseased, sick and almost

ready to fal from weakness. Then the tappings begin and are kept up until the horseÅ›

blood is sapped by weekly blood letting. To obtain this blood the animalÅ› head is stoutly

secured, a spot is selected on the left side of the horseÅ› neck immediately over a large

blood vessel, and a sharp pointed half inch tube about 12 inches long is driven in by force.

Large quantities of blood are removed and the process is repeated until the horse is

exhausted and unfit for further similar use. As if the diphtheria vaccine was not bad

enough, the vaccine promoters figured they could make more money by adding two other

unpopular vaccines (pertussis and tetanus). This triple poison was cal ed DPT, and by

pul ing some strings at government level they got it on the compulsory list.â€



TETANUS AND POLIO VACCINES



The serum for tetanus is the pus from the hoof of a horse. For the treatment of

polio an extract taken from putrefied monkey kidneys is used. Thousands of monkeys are

slaughtered, then their kidneys are removed and al owed to putrefy. Then chemicals are

mixed with the fluid extract from the rotted kidneys and then used as the serum for polio

shots.



DO VACCINATIONS WORK ?



â€œCook County Il . Hospital decided to immunize one-half of the nursing staff for

Diphtheria and not the other half. Diphtheria broke out soon after among the immunized

cases. Soon it invaded both halves, both the immunized and the not immunized, and the

total of cases was much higher among the supposedly immunized than among the not

immunized.â€

In Germany, where compulsory mass immunization was introduced in 1940, the number

of cases increased from 40,000 per year to 250,000 by 1945, virtual y al among

immunized children. On the other hand in Sweden, Diphtheria virtual y disappeared

without any immunizations.

Is it possible that vaccinations might not be such a good idea? Is it possible that the

premises upon which they are based may be faulty? Did you know that in recent

Congressional Hearings on vaccinations, Bil .2117, Congress refused to let scientists

opposed to vaccinations testify before the committee? If those scientists could have

spoken, the public would have found out that the increased chronic and degenerative

diseases are related to the paral el increases in the practice of mass vaccinations.



THE U.S. DOES NOT REQUIRE A VACCINE TO BE EFFECTIVE

â€œVaccines sold in the U.S. are not required to be effective against the disease they

claim 0t prevent, according to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.â€

(Consumer Newsweek, Jan. 28, 1972)



172





VEGETARIANISM



In 1980, the Los Angeles Times and Weekly World News carried articles about Wu

Yunging, a man who lived in China. Mr. Yunging was an extraordinary person, for he was

142 years old. What do you suppose his diet consisted of? He said that he eats corn, rice,

sweet potatoes, fruits, and vegetables. In other words, he ate no meat, milk, eggs, refined

oils, sugars, etc.. He lived to the age of 142 because he ate the kind of foods that God

original y gave mankind in the Garden of Eden. These foods were fruits, nuts, grains, and

herb bearing seeds. Can we improve upon God's perfect diet by eating flesh? No! Flesh

eating brings with it sickness, lack of energy, and a shorter life span.

Consider the elephant. How much dead flesh does he eat? None! And an elephant

can live for over one hundred years because he is a vegetarian; whereas carnivorous

animals, such as a cat or dog, live approximately 10-15 years. What are the strongest

animals in the world - the ones used for centuries because of their endurance and

strength? - elephants, water buffalo, camels, mules, and horses; and they al have this

one thing in common, they are vegetarians! A lion, which eats flesh exclusively, has very

little endurance, for he sleeps approximately 20 hours a day.



MAN'S BODY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO EAT MEAT



Let's look at some simple physiological aspects of meat eating. A carnivore's teeth

are long, sharp, and pointed for ripping and tearing flesh. Man has molars for crushing and

grinding. A carnivore's jaws moves up and down only, for tearing and biting. Man's moves

up and down and from side to side for grinding. A carnivore's tongue is rough, while man's

is smooth. A carnivore's saliva is acid and geared to the digestion of animal protein, while

man's saliva is alkaline for the digestion of starch. A carnivore's intestines are only three

times the length of its trunk, designed for rapid expulsion of food stuff, which would

otherwise quickly rot. Man's intestines, on the other hand, are twelve times the length of

his trunk, and designed to keep food in them until al nutrients are extracted. The liver and

kidneys of a carnivore are capable of eliminating large amounts of uric acid; whereas

man's liver and kidneys have the capacity to eliminate only a smal amount of uric acid. A

carnivore's urine is acid; man's is alkaline.

Man is also not psychological y equipped to eat meat. The average American is

repulsed by the sight of bloody, dead flesh. If we had to do our own slaughtering of the

animals we eat, I believe there would be fewer meat eaters.

Our refined food is now kil ing us on the instalment plan. More than 4,000 heart

attacks occur every day in the United States. Every 50 seconds a new diabetic is

discovered. Half of al Americans over 40 have high blood pressure. These diseases are

not found in 75% of the world's population. Why? Because Americans like to eat, they eat

too much, and they eat the wrong kinds of foods such as meat, milk, eggs, sugar, oil, and

refined and processed foods.
