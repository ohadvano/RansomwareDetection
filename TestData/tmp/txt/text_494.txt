I stand from the chair preparing to leave when Tom suddenly stands too. “Before you leave, I'd like to ask you something.”' He looks perplexed at me. “Did you and Mr. Daniels get along at all?”
Is he being serious?
“First, you ask me if I was close to Terry and now you're asking me if I got along with my English teacher. What is it that you really want to know?”
He becomes serious. “I do have my reasons to ask you this question Alice because after listening to you talk about Terry, I can't help but be suspicious that maybe you're somehow involved in this case.”
What!?
“How can I possibly be involved in this case?”
Tom slicks his hair back in frustration. “I know how this must sound to you, but just help me out here.”
I can only stare at him and wonder where I fit in all of this. “If you must know officer, Mr. Daniels was a great teacher who loved his job and cared about a lot of people. He'd always make sure that if any student of his needed extra help or support that he'd always be there for them. So, to answer your question about if I got along with him then the answer would be of course I did. He was always there whenever I needed someone to talk to about my dad who left, and no matter what he'd always listen and he'd tell me that I didn't need a father because I was strong enough to look after myself and my mother. I hope that answers your question.” I leave Tom standing alone in the kitchen and rush out to the front of the house making my way towards the car.
I get to my car, pick the right key and open the door when I hear my name being called several times. I ignore the voice and start getting into the car when a hand grabs onto my arm pulling me away from the car. I turn and stare directly into Ryder's eyes.
