The shape was undeniably feminine; a small waist with wide hips, and ample breasts. Her face had a single red eye glaring at them like hot coal, above a half-open mouth filled with sharp teeth. Her ears were pointy, her skin of a reddish hue, and striking, membranous black wings sprouted out of her back like the cursed sails of an old, lost ship.
Kiran clenched his ass cheeks. “Yeeek!”
“I’ll drink your blood and screw you all!” the popobawa said, and her clitoris abruptly swelled until it resembled a throbbing phallus.
“Attack!” said Gatril, lunging at the popobawa.
She leapt over the bosdrake and struck her in the back with her foot. Gatril winced and fell, but got up and leaped at her once more. The popobawa attacked but Gatril slammed her tail into the popobawa’s thigh.
The bat-creature yelled and took to the sky with a flap of her wings, cackling dreadfully as she zipped through the air. The popobawa dove at them with the intended vice-grip of her talons, forcing the trio into a frantic duck-for-cover scenario.
Gatril and Aparna tried to counter with acid and gunfire, but the popobawa was too fast for their attacks.
The flying attacker came after Kiran, and the boy ducked and fell. He still clung to his staff, pulling water from the air into a huge ball that had already grown as big as himself.
“Everyone!” said Gatril. “I’ll use my stun-fog! Cover your noses!”
Gatril predicted the popobawa had become quite comfortable in her swooping technique, and if she could just execute it when the popobawa was in her descent, it would affix her into a dive right into Gatril’s attack.
But the popobawa struck first, vomiting a dark smog. She flew in a circle around them to completely shroud them in the black smoke.
Aparna fanned the substance from her face and pulled her blouse over her nose. She turned to Kiran, but his form immediately became obscured. “Kiran!”
“Gatril? Aparna?” Kiran called to his friends, but could only hear them. He could vaguely make out the massive sphere of water before him. 
Almost ready, he thought.
Not even Gatril’s feral eyes could penetrate the darkness, yet alone that of the humans. But the popobawa’s single eye was specifically designed for such a task, able to clearly discern their body temperature and shape.
And Kiran was the perfect option for the popobawa. The popobawa snatched him by his shoulders and hoisted him into the air.
“Uhh! Help! Let go of me!” Kiran kicked but his thrashing was piddly compared to the strength of the popobawa.
“Don’t worry!” the popobawa said. “You’ll be screaming a whole lot when I bust open that ass of yours.”
Below, Kiran could see the smoke clearing, and the flames continuing to spread. No! Kiran thought. I got everyone into this mess! I should be able to save myself!
Kiran felt his spirit energy depleting, but the water he gathered was enough. He launched the liquid sphere over his head and it shuddered, bulged and popped. 
Water fell in huge droplets with the force of stones. They splattered upon the popobawa, continuously pushing her down and hitting against her wings—just as Kiran had planned earlier.
The popobawa swore and snarled. “Blast! You damn boy!”
Kiran clutched the staff and wailed upon her repeatedly. “Let go of me!” he said.
When the smoke cleared, Gatril saw the two in the air struggling. “Shit…” She tried to come up with a plan and turned to Aparna for assistance. 
However, the young woman seemed to have been a step ahead of her.
Resting her shooting arm on her other for support, Aparna used the last light of the vanquishing flames to aid her sight as she aimed at the popobawa. Once she had him in her sights, she smiled. “One point for me,” she said
Aparna fired. 
The muzzle flashed. 
The bullet found its mark, and the popobawa screamed, releasing Kiran. They both plummeted, and the women below screamed in despair.
But Kiran wouldn’t have it. His death wouldn’t be here. 
The young sorcerer reached out and grabbed the popobawa by the arm and pulled her close. Channeling the last of his spirit energy into his staff, Kiran used the force-counter spell to propel them across the sky. The blast was enough to change their trajectory and decrease their momentum. 
They hit the ground from seven meters up, and Kiran’s vision suddenly went dark.

Kiran woke the next morning to find himself the dimly lit confines of Gatril’s nest. His eyes were instantly met with Aparna sitting next to him, and Gatril along with an olive-skinned woman, her hands bound behind her and a vexed pout on her face.
“Hey…” Kiran said to everyone, his voice feeble. He tried sitting up but electric pain sat him back down. “Ouch…”
