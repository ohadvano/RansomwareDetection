Out of nowhere, Ryder slams his hand on the counter, “I don't give a shit if you tell him or not!”
Everything falls silent in the diner.
“Why do you have such a problem with him?” “Guys, calm down.” Kellan looks warily between us.
“You barely know the guy and you're already sticking up for him!?” Ryder spits.
“He's been nothing but polite to you! How dare you!” I hiss.
Ryder gets out of his seat and comes to stand face to face with me.
“Stay away from him.” He points at me. “I don't give a fuck if he's polite or not. I don't trust him and I won't tell you again. Stay away from him if you know what's good for you.”
“Who the hell do you think you are telling me to stay away from Max?” I lower my voice. “I am not part of your pack and I never will be. Don't ever tell me what I can and cannot do ever again.”
Just as I finish talking Robbie appears behind Ryder.
