“Today's all about you. It's a chance for you to let your wolf go and explore the areas around the property.
Hopefully, she'll gather a sense of freedom while she's at it.”
“What are you guys gonna do while she's exploring?”
Ryder points to himself. “I'll be following you at a distance. Far enough for me to know where you go.”
“Didn't Kellan say before that if she sees you she might attack you...again?”
Ryder takes in my appearance. “She can try.”
“Okay, whatever.” I shake my head in denial even though I know that Ryder is much stronger than I am, “Shouldn't our strengths be the same considering that we're both Alphas?”
The moment the word leaves my mouth, Silver and Bane both look at me with frowns written on their faces, while Kellan looks at their reaction with a grin.
Ryder crosses his arms over his chest. “Just because you're an Alpha it doesn't mean that you can easily overpower another”
