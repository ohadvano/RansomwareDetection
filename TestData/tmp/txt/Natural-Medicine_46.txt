the sperm cel s. This seminal fluid is very high in zinc and also contains proteins,

enzymes, fats and sugars to nourish the sperm. It is alkaline to overcome the acidity of the

female tract and it is a very watery medium in which the sperm can swim toward the

female egg.

More zinc is found in the prostate gland than any other organ in the body. Zinc is a

trace mineral needed in only very smal amounts, but a deficiency can lead to major

medical problems. Zinc is found in high concentration in sperm and seminal fluid. The

brain also must have adequate zinc in order to keep the thoughts organized and balanced.

Excessive sexual practice may lead to depletion of zinc stores which may be fol owed by

both prostate disease and neurologic and mental disorders. Al nerve tissue is also

dependent for proper functioning on this trace mineral.

Each day the prostate produces from 1/10 to 2/5 of a teaspoon of seminal fluid.

During sexual arousal four to ten times that amount is produced. The prostate also

becomes congested with blood during arousal. An overactive sexual life can cause

chronic congestion in the prostate. Over a long period of lime, the prostate yields to the

constant pressure, enlarging to make room for the extra blood and seminal fluid.

There is a higher rate of cancer of the prostate among blacks â€” two times that of

Caucasians and four times that of Asians. Medical researchers and social scientists have

postulated that their often higher incidence of sexual activity may have led to this increase

in prostate problems. Male hormones increase with sexual excitation. The male hormone

testosterone breaks down to dihydrotestosterone. It is known that this substance, at least

in some laboratory animals, can cause the prostate to enlarge. The male hormones seem

to be a major cause of prostate enlargement as prostate enlargement rarely occurs

among eunuchs.

Enlargement of the prostate can be detected during a rectal examination (in which

the physician inserts a gloved finger into the rectum). If the doctor's examining finger

discovers a hard, button-size nodule in the otherwise soft, rubbery tissue, he considers it

cancer until he has proved otherwise. (Three times out of five, it is cancer).

Symptoms of an enlarged prostate usual y develop gradual y, as the enlarging

prostate compresses and distorts the urethra, (urinary tube). The flow of urine is

constricted, and there is difficulty starting urination and a weak stream. If the prostate

becomes too enlarged it wil actual y close off the urinary tube completely. In extreme

cases the prostate can become as large as a grapefruit. This enlargement can be either

cancerous or benign, but is usual y cancerous.

Cancer of the prostate is the second most common cancer in men. It sometimes

develops in middle age, but most often occurs in the elderly. Most cancers of the prostate

are very slow growing and usual y the person wil die of some other disease such as heart



162

attack, stroke, diabetes, etc., before they would die of prostate cancer. Recent studies

suggest that if every case of prostate cancer were treated in its earliest stages, more men

would die of surgical complications than the disease itself.



DIET ATTECTS THE PROSTATE

It is of interest that diet is not usual y mentioned as a cause of cancer of the

prostate. Yet it is cited as very important in a 20 year study done by Dr. Roland Phil ips at

Loma Linda, California. The study showed that fatal prostate cancer was more common

depending on the frequency with which meat, milk, eggs and cheese were used in the

diet. As each one of these food substances was added to the diet, the risk increased.

(Journal of Epidemiology 120(2):244) Cancer of the prostate is substantial y less among

Seventh-Day Adventists who use no coffee, alcohol and little or no animal products.

(Cancer Research, 43:2403, May 1983) Persons with any kind of prostate problems must

make sure they are drinking plenty of water so that the urine is almost clear. They should

also be on a diet of mostly raw foods.



FOOD THAT IRRITATE THE PROSTATE

Alcohol, animal products, caffeine, and spices should be eliminated from the diet of

those who have prostate problems. Animal products should be removed from the diet

because of the purine content which tends to increase the irritability of the bladder which

can indirectly affect the prostate gland. Caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, colas and

chocolate is an irritant to the urinary tract. It has been shown that just one cup of coffee

per day can cause 2 1/2 times greater incidence of cancer of the bladder. Spices also

have a tendency to irritate the prostate and bladder and should be removed from the diet.



NUTRITIONAL TREATMENT VS. CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT

The primary conventional treatments administered for enlarged prostate are

catheter drainage, estrogenic hormones, prostatic massage, and of course, closed

transurethral prostatic resection or, alternatively, removal of the prostate. Unfortunately,

doctors (and patients) have found surgery to be a radical remedy to this*" common

affliction, often resulting in complications. More and more patients are opting for a safer

cure.

Because of its nontraumatic, natural way the nutritional approach is preferable to

the more orthodox procedures.



For Prostate Enlargement Use Saw Palmetto Berries and Zinc



Enlarged prostate responds wel to the herb saw palmetto berries. Saw Palmetto is

a smal palm tree native to the West Indies and the Atlantic Coast of North America

extending from North Carolina to Florida. The trees are crowned with large, two to four-

foot high spiny-toothed leaves which form a circular, fan-shaped outline.

The plant's deep red-brown to black berries are wrinkled, oblong, and 0.5 to 1 - inch

in length with a diameter of 0.5 inch. They contain about 1.5 percent of a fruity smel ing oil

loaded with the sterol betasitosterol and its glu-coside, plus the saturated and unsaturated

fatty acids of captric, caprylic, caproic, lauric, palmitic, and ol eic. These fatty acids

comprise 63% of the oil, with the remaining portion consisting of their ethyl esters and the

mentioned sterols. Also present are carotenes, lipase, tannins and sugars.

Serenoa Repens (Saw Palmetto berries) has been found to be extremely effective

in treating prostate enlargement, according to a study by Dr. G. Champault published in

the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. Serenoa works by countering the effect of



163

decreased testosterone in your system, (which al ows other hormones, including DHT, to

increase the size of the prostate.) Dr. C. Sultan, in a study published in the Journal of

Steroid Biochemistry, found that Serenoa contains sterol like compounds that inhibit the

formation of DHT. This nutrient comes from a berry produced by a palm species common

to the Southeast United States. American Indians felt it was a cure for prostate problems.

European scientists have confirmed these effects in 12 major scientific studies done over

the past twenty years.

Prostate disorders are much more common in developed countries, such as the

United States, than in Third World countries. There are a few reasons why. The primary

one is that the majority of American meals are overcooked or over processed. The

processing of food destroys a good portion, if not al , of one of the most important

nutrients used by the prostate gland - zinc.



The Prostate Needs 10 Times More Zinc Than Any Other Organ



Most of the zinc in food is lost in processing, or never exists in a substantial amount

due to nutrient poor soil. Zinc is not normal y replaced in the soil when chemical fertilizers

are used. The world famous founder of the free radical theory of aging, Dr. Denham

Harman, M.D., Ph.D. professor emeritus of the University of Nebraska School of Medicine,

stated, "Some 90% of the population consumes diets deficient in zinc."

The prostate uses 10 times more of this nutrient than any other organ in the body.

As the production of testosterone declines, an enzyme stimulates the production of DHT

and other hormones which cause enlargement. Many scientists have confirmed that when

sufficient zinc is present, it helps prevent that enzyme from doing its damage.



Dr. M. S. Fahin and Dr. H. A. Essa published a clinical study in a government

medical journal showing that treatment with zinc reduces prostate enlargement. Dr.

Geoffrey Crisholin and Dr. Alan Leake reported in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry that

zinc prevents the hormonal actions that causes prostate enlargement. In total, fifteen

prominent research scientists published confirming reports that sufficient zinc is of vital

necessity for having a healthy prostate gland. Significant quantities of zinc are found in

brewerâ€™s yeast, lima beans, pecans, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and soybeans.

Smal er amounts of zinc are found in legumes and whole grains.



Hydrotherapy and Massage Will Help Reduce the Enlarged Prostate Gland



Hot and cold sitz baths alternating, using 3 minutes hot and one minute cold, are

beneficial for an enlarged prostate gland. You always start with the hot and end with the

cold. This combination can be done from 3 to 5 times, and should be done once or twice a

day. Massage of the prostate (through the rectum) can help reduce the swel ing and help

in the recovery of an enlarged prostate.

Prostate problems very rarely occur before the age of 30. At the age of 50 there wil

be a 25 percent chance of an enlarged prostate. At the age of 60 about half of al men wil

have developed some enlargement of the prostate. At the age of 80 almost al men wil

have some enlargement.



PROSTATE CANCER FACTS



Despite a major hoopla over the new Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test,

concurrent biopsies and early aggressive treatment for prostate cancer, the best treatment

for most men is no treatment at all. Here are the facts:



164



â€¢ Most cases of cancer of the prostate are so slow growing that they rarely become

life threatening.

â€¢ For men who are under 70, early detection and radical treatment may increase life

by less than one year, but complications are too severe to warrant prostatectomy

(removal of the prostate).

â€¢ Approximately one in 380 men with prostate cancer wil die of the disease.

â€¢ In a major study from Sweden, men of median age 72 were fol owed over ten

years. Al had prostate cancer. After ten years, the cancer death rate was 8.5% for

those men who received no treatment. The cancer death rate for American men

who are treated aggressively (PSA testing, drugs and prostatectomy) is 15%.

â€¢ The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute have long

advocated yearly rectal exams for men over 40. This screening is now being

escalated to recommendation for PSA blood test for men over 50. Both these tests

are absolutely meaningless, given the new results of testing. There is no reason for

early prostate cancer when the optimum treatment is no treatment at al .

â€¢ The PSA test is a poor test. More than one-third of al men with prostate cancer wil

have normal PSA test. The rate of positive test for men with no cancer is even

higher.

â€¢ The positive PSA tests foster lots of biopsies to test further for prostate cancer.

When biopsies are positive, many if not most doctors wil opt for a radical

prostatectomy. The risks of this procedure are severe. Within a month, 8% of men

wil suffer cardiovascular complications and 2% wil die. Impotence, bladder

problems and bowel obstruction are not uncommon.

â€¢ Dr. Frank Hinman, Jr. of the University of California, San Francisco School of

Medicine, observes that mass screening of prostate cancer in elderly men may

have more risks than benefits.



While 2.5% of men die of prostate cancer, the greatest proportion of men screened

for prostate cancer may be subjected to unnecessary stress and anxiety, expensive

diagnostic testing and unnecessary treatment. (Internal Medicine News 24(21)52,

November 1-14, 1991)

SUGAR AND HONEY



In 1882, the average American ate 2 teaspoons of sugar per day. In 1870, it was 11

teaspoons per day. In 1980, we consumed 35 teaspoons of sugar per day; and now the

average is over 42 teaspoons per day. (See chart on Sugar Content of some popular

foods).



WHAT IS SUGAR?

Sugar is a carbohydrate that occurs natural y in various forms in al living things. In

its natural form, sugar, as found in the sugar cane or sugar beet, is combined with a large

amount of fiber, and also contains iron, potassium, calcium, B vitamins, etc.. These

nutrients are needed to digest the sugar that is in the sugar beet or sugar cane, However

white sugar, as we get it today, has been robbed of almost 100% of these nutrients. White

sugar is so pure and refined that it basical y has nothing in it but 'empty calories'.

Concentrated, pure sugar is a drug, unrelated to anything that occurs natural y, and

is very harmful to your body. According to John Yudlin, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Nutririon

at London University, "If only a smal fraction of what is known about the effects of sugar

was revealed in relation to any other food additive, that material would be promptly

banned".

Sugar throws off the calcium-phosphorous balance, and disrupts the entire

important phase of your body machinery. Because refined sugar has been robbed of the B

vitamins that are necessary for its assimilation by the body, it latches on to these wherever

it finds them - namely, in your digestive tract, so that the person who eats refined sugar is

bound to be short on the B vitamins. Result? Nervousness, skin troubles, digestive

trouble, and a host of other disorders which lead to much more serious problems later on.

The more sugar you eat, the lower your body's resistance to disease becomes. To

have good health we must have a strong immune system. Sugar lowers our body's

immune system, making it weak instead of strong. In our body we have white blood cel s,

which are cal ed warrior cel s. These attack and destroy bacteria. However, when we eat

refined sugar, it causes our white blood cel s to become sluggish, causing them to lose

their ability to destroy as many bacteria.

In a healthy body, where no refined sugar is eaten, one white blood cel can destroy

14 bacteria. If a person then eats 12 teaspoons of sugar (a 12 oz. bottle of Cola has 10

teaspoons), one of their white blood cel s wil only be able to destroy 5.5 bacteria. If a

person eats 24 teaspoons of sugar (a banana split has 25 teaspoons of sugar), one of

their white blood cel s wil only be able to destroy 1 bacteria. This weakening effect on the

white blood cel usual y lasts for approximately 5 hours. To keep our body's immune

system strong, we must leave sugar alone.



Refined sugar drains out the mineral salts of the blood, bones, and tissues. It

causes hyperactivity and dental caries. It causes obesity, diabetes, low blood sugar, high

blood pressure, duodenal ulcers, fatty livers, coronary and vascular disease, gout,

dermatitis, and cancer. According to the American Journal of Hypertension (3:560-562,

1990), sucrose (sugar) intake may increase the blood pressure. Other studies have

indicated that the intake of refined carbohydrates produces an increase in the blood

pressure.

WHAT ABOUT HONEY?



Honey is not a disaccharide like sugar; it is a

monosaccharide which does not over-stimulate the

pancreas. Sugar, which comes from beets or cane, is

sucrose, a disaccharide, which over-stimulates the

pancreas. Sugar also must undergo digestion, a process

that changes it into simple sugar; whereas, honey is pre-

digested and takes a load of work off the stomach and

pancreas.



Honey is refined by the bees, whereas sugar is

refined by man under less than ideal conditions, for man is

not as careful or as diligent as the honey bee. Bees have to

col ect nectar from nearly two mil ion flower blossoms to

produce just one pound of honey. Bees are faithful and

diligent in their work of making honey. Of course, pure

organic raw honey is better than what you buy at the local



167

grocery store. Raw honey wil in a short time crystal ize because it has not been heated to

a high temperature and had al the enzymes destroyed. Honey also has more vitamins

and minerals than sugar. (See chart for comparison)

America has become addicted to sugar. The average per person consumption in

the U.S. is almost 135 pounds a year! Americans may be thought of as meat and potato

eaters, but the average per person consumption of red meat is only 111 pounds per year,

and of potatoes only 123 pounds per year.

Increasingly more Americans, however, are becoming aware of the danger in sugar

consumption; and for some time now, the public has been exploring sweet alternatives.

How safe are these artificial sweeteners? We are al familiar with the fact that some of

these artificial sweeteners have been associated with cancer. I wil merely give current

information on one of these sweeteners.



SWEETENER LINKED TO CONFUSION AND MEMORY LOSS



Aspartame, the artificial sweetener widely used in diet soda and food, may cause

confusion and memory loss in some people. This finding came from a study of 551 people

who had severe reactions to aspartame, which is marketed under the brand name of

NutraSweet. HJ. Roberts, director of the Palm Beach Institute for Medical Research in

Florida, found that 157 of the participants had major problems. Eleven lost vision in one or

both eyes; one-third suffered from severe dizziness; half reported severe headaches. One

18 year-old male, who drank about two quarts of aspartame-sweetened diet soda daily,

could not find his way home in his own neighborhood. Severe reactions to the sweetener

occurred three times more often in women. Although the Food and Drug Administration

has received hundreds of complaints about aspartame from consumers, no adequate

studies have been conducted. (New Scientist, 2/18/88).



WHAT CAN WE USE THEN INSTEAD OF SUGAR?

Use natural sugar just as the Good Lord put it in the food, such as fresh peaches,

strawberries, cherries, watermelon, etc. A more concentrated natural sugar would be

found in dates, figs, raisins, dried fruits, honey, etc.

TESTIMONIALS TO

NATURAL HEALTH LIFESTYLE



At every session of our lifestyle center we were thril ed to see lives changed to the

glory of God; we saw individuals make an about face in their lifestyle, and begin their

journey on the path of abundant health and happiness. At the end of every session our

guests testified to the value of our program in their lives. Many of them write testimonials

which are published in our newsletters. The fol owing stories are about some of these

guests who have given permission to print their stories. However, to protect their privacy,

the names have been changed.



FORMER LIFESTYLE GUEST DISCONTINUES HIS DAILY 125 MG. OF

MORPHINE.



Len Dyer (not his real name) and his wife attended our 26- day lifestyle session.

Len came to us with an advanced stage of prostate cancer. In the past, Len had

undergone surgery, radiation and chemotherapy and there was nothing more the doctors

could do except give him morphine for the pain. For the past year Len had been taking

125 mg. of morphine daily. Len's wife had contacted me by phone and I had started Len

on our program while he was at home as we couldn't take him immediately.

With the skil ful use of God's eight natural remedies of fresh air, pure soft water,

natural food, rest, exercise, sunshine, temperance, and trust in God, Len was able to

completely discontinue his morphine. Slowly his strength and digestion improved and

thoughts became clearer. He stil had some bad days but overal he was improving.

After his stay here, he went home looking and feeling much better. We I decided to

cal him and see how he was doing. It had been over six weeks since we had talked to

him. He is stil not using any morphine and is slowly recovering with occasional bad days.

Len is thankful he had the opportunity to attend one of our sessions and learn the natural

ways to good health.



RONALD'S STORY



Ronald Flood (not his real name) from Puerto Rico attended our 26-day lifestyle

session. After hearing about our program from a friend who was a previous client. Ronald

was a successful businessman and the owner of 10 jewelry stores; but now at the age of

48, major health problems brought him seeking relief to our center.

Until 11/2 years ago, Ronald had been a heavy drinker. He had undergone a gal

bladder operation, and was having liver problems. He was retaining fluid, especial y in his

feet. His arms and legs would fal asleep at night; and he had swel ing of the lymph glands

in his neck. Ronald also had real problems with digestion, having only two or three bowel

movements a week. He always felt tired, and realized he needed help.

Ronald was accustomed to eating lots of meat, and drinking lots of milk, coffee,

colas, and tea; but he readily accepted his new pure vegetarian diet. This diet, high in
