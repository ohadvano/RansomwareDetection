Everyone knows who they are and no one dares to try and talk to them or to even approach them. They walk side by side in a perfect line. Bane and Silver on the outside, with Kellan and Ryder in the middle.
Bane looks to be the most frightening one out of them all. He has an oval shaped face with small, blue piercing eyes. His mouth, full and firm with a constant sneer on his face. He has tanned skin with a warm, golden brown tint that accentuates his large muscular frame. His hair was thick, black and slicked down with both sides of his head shaved. Bane also had a black bushy beard decorating his face. It was hard sometimes to take him seriously with the beard because it kind of makes him look like a big old teddy bear, but if the rumors were true, you definitely shouldn't say that to his face, not unless you wanted to end up in A&E. He wears a plain white wife-beater that's low enough to show the hairs on his chest, and a long black necklace rests on his chest that looks like a triskelion. He wears black tight jeans with black ankle boots with a small heel.
I look over at Silver who walks on the far right corner and just blatantly stare at her. Every girl wants to be her, and every guy in this school wants to date her, but everyone knows that she's in love with Ryder. The way she looks and smiles at him with her perfect teeth and her perfect body. She has a heart-shaped face with pale, smooth skin and bright blue eyes. Her mouth is full and perfectly shaped which helps accentuates her pouty lips. Her long wild, black untamed hair rests on her left shoulder and hangs down by her waist. Her build small but muscular.
Rumours say that she kicked a jocks ass once after he slapped her ass. He left in an ambulance, and didn't return to school until the next month. No one ever touched her again. Not after that. She wears a black leather jacket that cuts to her waist, plain black shorts, and black thigh high boots.
The kindest looking one out of them all is Kellan. It seems kinda odd to see him with these people. He has an oval shaped face with creamy fair skin, dark brown eyes that look haunted but yet gentle at the same time. His face holds no expression which makes it hard to determine whether he's happy or sad. Curly brown hair frames his perfectly shaped face. He wears a black stretcher in his left ear with both of his arms covered in colourful art. His body slim with no ounce of body fat, just pure muscle. He wears a plain black wife - beater, tight black jeans and black sneakers. Kellan just might be the only approachable one out of them all. He has this kind aura about him that draws people in, and it makes it impossible to dislike him. I remember when he and his girlfriend were together. Anna was one of the sweetest girls in this school, and every single person here respected her and treated her with the utmost kindness, but Kellan lost the love of his life over a year ago. Her body was found by the river near the creek in the early hours of the morning.
People say that the crime scene was like something out of a horror film. Nevertheless, Kellan lost a part of himself after losing Anna, and I didn't blame him.
“What makes her so special? I bet she has like a magic vagina or something plus, she's probably slept with all three of them.”
I look away from Kellan just as he passes by us, and gasp at my best friend. “Sam, stop staring before she beats you up as well as you ending up in the hospital!”
“What? It's not like she can hear me.”
