“Of course I remember. It's kinda hard to forget being in a fight that happened on my first day of school.” He stares at Ryder.
Ryder's posture goes rigid as he stares directly back at Max. “What the fuck are you looking at?”
Yeah, maybe bringing Ryder was a bad idea.
Max wheezes. “Who do you think I'm looking at? I'm looking at you asshole considering you're the one who's beaten the crap out of me twice already!”
Ryder pushes himself off the couch, grabs Max by the collar of his shirt and slams him against the wall.
“Ryder, stop it!” I shout, hoping that Ryder's not stupid enough to make this situation worse than it already is.
“Say that again Fields. I fucking dare you!”
Max ignores Ryder and looks at me. “Why is it that girls always fall for the guy that thinks he's a hero when in reality, he just looks like a complete idiot?”
“Shut your mouth.” Ryder slams him against the wall again.
