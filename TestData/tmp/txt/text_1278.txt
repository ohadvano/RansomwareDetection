I take the bowl to the table where Max silently lies and use the clear water to rinse the wounds on his face. Having no idea if open wounds are on his body, I take a pair of scissors from the medical kit and cut up the middle of his shirt. I close my eyes hoping that his body has been left unscathed, but when I open them, tears start to fall when I notice the purple bruises on both sides of his ribs.
With my fingers, I gently examine him to find out if there's any broken ribs, but sigh in relief when I don't feel anything out of place. I draw my attention back to his badly injured face and apply some antibiotic cream to help keep the cuts moist and to help the body's natural healing process. Through it all, Max doesn't flinch or show any kind of discomfort as I treat him.
I take out one of the chairs and sit next to him when suddenly he starts to stir. He looks around in confusion but soon relaxes when he sees me sitting next to him.
He sits up so effortlessly and hangs his legs over the table when he overcomes with dizziness, I rush to him quickly and hold his shoulders to help keep him from falling forwards. “You should be lying down.”
Max only chuckles. “Alice, I'm fine, honestly.”
“No, you shouldn't do this to yourself. Your body needs to rest.”
Max pulls my hands off his shoulders and cradles them in his palms. “I've done enough resting for tonight.”
“You didn't see what I saw back at the party. Nothing will make me forget what I saw.”
He strokes his thumb gently along my fingertips. “I'm sorry you had to see me in that state. Again.”
