Gatril decided to play her part, and got behind the j’bafofi and reached over her thigh for Shirksire’d already slick vagina. As Gatril rubbed her swollen clitoris she began to moan with Kiran, her other hands gripping her thigh as Kiran tightened his hand on her hair.
Once Gatril felt her fingers becoming sufficiently most she brought around the bowl beneath Shirksire. She started dripping inside it. Gatril removed her hand and tasted it. “Hmmm…”
“Bring it here…” said Kiran, his face contorting with pleasure.
Gatril got up and put her hand to Kiran’s mouth. He sucked her fingers and met a tangy taste of something like a sour fruit and raw meat. Kiran leaned into Gatril with a kiss, and slid his finger inside her crotch—abruptly gripped Shirksire’s head, stiffened and tipped on his toes. “Ooooooh!”
Kiran exploded inside Shirksire’s mouth. The j’bafofi pulled away and gagged. She cupped her hand under her chin and opened her mouth to let his semen slide off her tongue and into her palm.
Kiran sighed loudly and staggered back into Gatril’s embrace. “Oh man…”
Shirksire flicked her hand and flung the semen on the floor. She turned to Kiran, wiping her mouth. “You could’ve told me you were going to do that.”
“Sorry,” said Kiran. “I got lost in the moment You were really good for your first time…”
“I’m a quick learner,” said Shirksire. She took up the wait bowl from beneath her and looked in it. “But I haven’t reached my orgasm yet.”
“Oh, don’t worry,” said Kiran, holding his still sturdy penis. “I still have a round left inside me.”
Surprised, Shirksire stood up. “Again? Already?”
Gatril said, “That’s how we do it. Now get on your hands and knees. I want to try a position I always thought about.”
“Please,” Shirksire said, “nothing drastic.” She leaned over, and Gatril carefully climbed onto her back. “W-What—”
“I see,” said Kiran. He positioned himself behind Shirksire, his hip in line with her bottom, his face with Gatril’s. Kiran caressed Gatril’s vagina with his tongue while slowly thrusting his penis inside Shirksire.
Shirksire’s body tense and she moaned, feeling every inch of Kiran’s member press against her walls. Gatril bit her lips and gyrated her bottom in Kiran’s face while he slowly thrusted in and out of Shirksire.
Kiran started slow as usual, making sure to savor the taste of Gatril and the feeling inside Shirksire. Both women’s moans filled the cave, and got increasingly louder as Kiran picked up the pace. Kiran’s tongue moved friskily now, making Gatril wiggle and tense spasmodically. His thrusting hips slapped his testicles against Shirksire and she became more tender, arching her back. 
Kiran squeezed Gatril’s bottom for support as his mouth dug into her, until she yelled and sprayed her fluids into his mouth. Kiran hung onto her and lapped up everything, while Shirksire succumbed to the relentless pounding inside her and reached her own climax. A very loud, wet and warm one.
Kiran finished up with another load of semen that stung the Shirksire’s cervix.
“Ouch!” was her response.
Finally drained, Kiran fell on his back. Shirksire collapsed and Gatril rolled off her. All three individuals were on the floor, and one by one they all fell asleep.

When they woke up Kiran quickly made the spell, with Shirksire seated before him and looking intently.
“So you can only use queex?” said Shirksire.
“No,” Kiran said as he mixed the contents in the bowl. “But in my case it makes for a unique spell, plus I also want the battle experience.”
“…I see,” Shirksire said. “Are you sure you are not a sexplorer?”
Kiran laughed. “Don’t get me wrong, I love sex, but not as much as I love magic.” Kiran finished making a white orb with grey ripples. He tossed between his hands, waiting for it to dry. “However, I still feel a little urge to have intercourse with bea…ferrans. They have such different flavors.”
“Are you his girlfriend, bosdrake?” Shirksire said.
“Friend with benefits,” Gatril replied. “You can join the group too, if you want.”
Shirksire pontificated on the offer, tapping her index finger from three of her hands. “I would love to have someone teach me magic, but I…”
Kiran was putting the orb into the fifth and final socket when he looked up at Shirksire’s troubled expression. “What is it?”
Shirksire said, “I feel much safe in this cave than outside.”
“Trust me,” said Gatril, “someone like you wouldn’t have much to fear. You just need to mark out your own territory. You can even stay with me if you wan to.”
“Really…?” Shirksire said, half rising from her seat. 
“Of course,” said Gatril. “I’m close to where Kiran lives. He can always visit us.”
Then Shirksire’s elation dwindled when she realized something. “…But my books…There are a lot of them.”
