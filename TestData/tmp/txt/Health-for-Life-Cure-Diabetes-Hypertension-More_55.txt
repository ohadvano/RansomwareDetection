
fifteen inches square and about one hundred incisions are made. Into these incisions one

drop of glycerinated lymph, (a culture of smal pox passed through a solution of glycerine)

is al owed to drop in and is thoroughly rubbed in. Fever sets in, and the animal becomes

exceedingly sick. In a few days the vesicles appear, the scabs form, and the elimination

of impurities of various kinds from the blood of the calf begins in the form of pus, which is

thrown out of the blood into the vesicles. At the end of six days the process of elimination

has proceeded so far that the vesicles are ful of putrid cel s, etc., and a scab has formed

over the reservoir of disease. The calf is once more bound and laid upon the operating

table. The inoculated area is washed with water and each vesicle is clasped with clamps

separately. The crust is careful y scrapped with the edge of a steel instrument and the

dead skin, lymph, poisonous pus and blood are exuded and are transferred to a smal

crucible.



To this toxic mass of putrid matter is added an equal measure of glycerine, and the

mass is then thoroughly stirred and mixed by a smal electric motor. As soon as it is

rendered homogeneous, it is placed in another crucible and passed through a very fine

sieve, in order to remove the coarse pieces of rotten flesh, hair, etc. Then the mixture is

again stirred and thoroughly mixed, transferred to tubes and distributed through out the

country as pure calf lymph. Today most places in the world have banned smal pox

vaccinations, however the U.S. military medical authorities continue to make smal pox

vaccine and apparently use it on enlisted personal.

DIPHTHERIA VACCINE



â€œA horse is prepared for blood sapping (as they cal it) by a course of gradual

poisoning with the throat excretions of patients who are suffering from diphtheria. The

poison is administered only a little at the first injection, but day by day the dose is

increased until the limit is reached. That is when the horse is diseased, sick and almost

ready to fal from weakness. Then the tappings begin and are kept up until the horseÅ›

blood is sapped by weekly blood letting. To obtain this blood the animalÅ› head is stoutly

secured, a spot is selected on the left side of the horseÅ› neck immediately over a large

blood vessel, and a sharp pointed half inch tube about 12 inches long is driven in by force.

Large quantities of blood are removed and the process is repeated until the horse is

exhausted and unfit for further similar use. As if the diphtheria vaccine was not bad

enough, the vaccine promoters figured they could make more money by adding two other

unpopular vaccines (pertussis and tetanus). This triple poison was cal ed DPT, and by

pul ing some strings at government level they got it on the compulsory list.â€



TETANUS AND POLIO VACCINES



The serum for tetanus is the pus from the hoof of a horse. For the treatment of

polio an extract taken from putrefied monkey kidneys is used. Thousands of monkeys are

slaughtered, then their kidneys are removed and al owed to putrefy. Then chemicals are

mixed with the fluid extract from the rotted kidneys and then used as the serum for polio

shots.



DO VACCINATIONS WORK ?



â€œCook County Il . Hospital decided to immunize one-half of the nursing staff for

Diphtheria and not the other half. Diphtheria broke out soon after among the immunized

cases. Soon it invaded both halves, both the immunized and the not immunized, and the

total of cases was much higher among the supposedly immunized than among the not

immunized.â€

In Germany, where compulsory mass immunization was introduced in 1940, the number

of cases increased from 40,000 per year to 250,000 by 1945, virtual y al among

immunized children. On the other hand in Sweden, Diphtheria virtual y disappeared

without any immunizations.

Is it possible that vaccinations might not be such a good idea? Is it possible that the

premises upon which they are based may be faulty? Did you know that in recent

Congressional Hearings on vaccinations, Bil .2117, Congress refused to let scientists

opposed to vaccinations testify before the committee? If those scientists could have

spoken, the public would have found out that the increased chronic and degenerative

diseases are related to the paral el increases in the practice of mass vaccinations.



THE U.S. DOES NOT REQUIRE A VACCINE TO BE EFFECTIVE

â€œVaccines sold in the U.S. are not required to be effective against the disease they

claim 0t prevent, according to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.â€

VEGETARIANISM



In 1980, the Los Angeles Times and Weekly World News carried articles about Wu

Yunging, a man who lived in China. Mr. Yunging was an extraordinary person, for he was

142 years old. What do you suppose his diet consisted of? He said that he eats corn, rice,

sweet potatoes, fruits, and vegetables. In other words, he ate no meat, milk, eggs, refined

oils, sugars, etc.. He lived to the age of 142 because he ate the kind of foods that God

original y gave mankind in the Garden of Eden. These foods were fruits, nuts, grains, and

herb bearing seeds. Can we improve upon God's perfect diet by eating flesh? No! Flesh

eating brings with it sickness, lack of energy, and a shorter life span.

Consider the elephant. How much dead flesh does he eat? None! And an elephant

can live for over one hundred years because he is a vegetarian; whereas carnivorous

animals, such as a cat or dog, live approximately 10-15 years. What are the strongest

animals in the world - the ones used for centuries because of their endurance and

strength? - elephants, water buffalo, camels, mules, and horses; and they al have this

one thing in common, they are vegetarians! A lion, which eats flesh exclusively, has very

little endurance, for he sleeps approximately 20 hours a day.



MAN'S BODY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO EAT MEAT



Let's look at some simple physiological aspects of meat eating. A carnivore's teeth

are long, sharp, and pointed for ripping and tearing flesh. Man has molars for crushing and

grinding. A carnivore's jaws moves up and down only, for tearing and biting. Man's moves

up and down and from side to side for grinding. A carnivore's tongue is rough, while man's

is smooth. A carnivore's saliva is acid and geared to the digestion of animal protein, while

man's saliva is alkaline for the digestion of starch. A carnivore's intestines are only three

times the length of its trunk, designed for rapid expulsion of food stuff, which would

otherwise quickly rot. Man's intestines, on the other hand, are twelve times the length of

his trunk, and designed to keep food in them until al nutrients are extracted. The liver and

kidneys of a carnivore are capable of eliminating large amounts of uric acid; whereas

man's liver and kidneys have the capacity to eliminate only a smal amount of uric acid. A

carnivore's urine is acid; man's is alkaline.

Man is also not psychological y equipped to eat meat. The average American is

repulsed by the sight of bloody, dead flesh. If we had to do our own slaughtering of the

animals we eat, I believe there would be fewer meat eaters.

Our refined food is now kil ing us on the instalment plan. More than 4,000 heart

attacks occur every day in the United States. Every 50 seconds a new diabetic is

discovered. Half of al Americans over 40 have high blood pressure. These diseases are

not found in 75% of the world's population. Why? Because Americans like to eat, they eat

too much, and they eat the wrong kinds of foods such as meat, milk, eggs, sugar, oil, and

refined and processed foods.

Meat is an incomplete source of nutrition; consequently, reliance on a meat based

diet actual y becomes a liability to human health. But meat is not only a liability for what it

does not contain; it is a liability for what it does contain - excess protein, fat, cholesterol,

and blood, besides worms, microbes, and cancer viruses(1).



MORE BACTERIA IN MOST MEAT THAN IN MANURE



Meat is dead flesh; and something that is dead should be buried and not put into

our stomachs. Flavor in meat is due to the presence of uric acid that is in the meat. What

is uric acid? It is one of the waste or excretory products of the body; or, .simply said, it is

the animal's urine. Uric acid is not the only thing about meat that is bad. One very bad

thing is the putrefactive bacteria found in meat. This bacteria in meats are identical in

character with those found in manure, and are more numerous in some meats than in

fresh manure. A microscopic count has been made of bacteria found in meats of various

kinds, so that people might know what they are getting when they eat meat(2). (SEE

CHART).
