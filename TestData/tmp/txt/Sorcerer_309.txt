The mass of branches bent and folded around four trees, covered by a layer of large leaves knitted together. The scene managed to spark both disappointment and intrigue in Kiran. “This is where you live?” he said.
“Yes,” said Gatril. “Wonderful, isn’t it?”
Kiran studied the finer details of the construction, noting that it resembled a dome somewhat, along with wooden posts that made up the frame. The inside had two straw beds, the second Gatril had prepared the previous night. Lighting was provided by holes in the walls, covered by large leaves. 
Gatril gestured to one of the beds. “Sit.”
“Umm…” Kiran carefully seated himself, looking across at the bosdrake on her own bed.
“So,” said Gatril, “Kiran, let me see what you’ve got.”
Kiran took out jars, scalpels, tiny prongs, his lunch and a book out of his bag and laid them on the floor. Beside the book, he put everything else aside, and opened the text. “This is a book of all spells that can be easily done with animal parts,” he said.
Gatril took the book and looked through the first five pages. She put it down and said, “But you know in order to do spells, you have to be able to use your spirit energy?”
Kiran replied with a sly grin. He opened his palm. His forehead furrowed with concentration, and he produced a faint white light in his hand. “I already learned it. My grandfather taught me.”
Gatril’s face puckered. She hadn’t been expecting this level of commitment from the boy. “That’s impressive,” she said. “Accessing one’s spiritual energy can’t be done by just anyone. You and your grandfather seem to have latent talent for it.”
“We do,” he said. “My father’s side comes from a long line of sorcerers and witches. My grandfather, when he was younger, he failed to slay a wyvern that was terrorizing a town. He was ashamed and forced himself into retirement. His name as a wizard wasn’t good anymore. That’s why his son, my father, took on carpeting as a profession. But I want to become a sorcerer just like we used to be.”  Kiran dispelled the light from him hand and relaxed. “So, like…how are we going to start this?” Kiran took out a smooth ovoid object and some water. “I’d brought these to…you know…” and Kiran made a thrusting motion with the object.
Gatril slapped the objects from Kiran’s hands. Kiran flinched, forming a pout as he stared at her. “Rubbish! Is that how you intend to get what you want?”
Kiran nervously rubbed his neck. “Well I don’t know how else.”
“You’ve never had sex before, you said?” Gatril said.
“Nope,” said Kiran. “Not with a human or a beast.”
“Hmm,” said Gatril. “I guess you’re not a sexplorer then.”
“A what?” Kiran said.
“Sexplorers,” said Gatril. “They’re humans who travel the world with the goal of having sex with rare and exotic people and monsters. They’re mostly men, though you have a few horny women who do it too.”
“Wow,” Kiran said. “That’s really perverted. Have you ever met one?”
“Once,” said Gatril. “He was a foreigner. He was a nice man. But he was a rarity. Sexplorers are usually rapists. Some even kill and eat the monsters they have sex with.”
Something ran up Kiran’s back and made him shudder. “Well, I’m not like that! I just want ingredients for my spells.”
“Just my queex, right?” Gatril crept closer to Kiran. She sunk her finger into her crotch and stirred the center. Kiran’s body jittered, and blood flooded his crotch. “If you want my queex, young sorcerer, there’s only one way to get it.”
Kiran’s mouth opened and a hissing exhaled came out. He couldn’t take his eyes off Gatril’s vagina as she spread the lips of it and stuck her finger inside. “I’ve never done this before…” he repeated.
“Don’t worry,” said Gatril. “I’ll show you.” She took her hand from between her legs and brought it to Kiran’s nose, jarring him with the pungent smell of fresh onion and roasted turkey. She stuck her fingers in the boy’s mouth, tickling his tongue with them. Kiran savored the taste, and his penis throbbed rhythmically.
Gatril took her fingers out of his mouth as she smiled mischievously. “If you want a woman’s queex, you must do it the right way.”
Gatril laid on her back and opened her legs. “Come, young sorcerer.”
This is it now, Kiran thought as he bent over and grabbed her thighs. This is how I lose my virginity. Well, It’s not like she’s ugly. I guess I just have to enjoy the ride.
Kiran took a deep sniff, absorbing the fragrance in his lungs. He tickled her vulva with his tongue, sending electrifying ripples up her stomach. She grabbed his breasts of if the hold her body steady. Kiran wagged his tongue inside her until he found the bud of flesh. With long, deep strokes of his muscular appendage Kiran produced more stimulation. Gatril uttered soft moans and closed her eyes, kneading her breast to assuage the overwhelming desire for satisfaction within her. All the while Kiran’s penis throbbed painfully, yearning for its own release.
Gatril got moister inside. “…Yes…that’s a good boy…”
Kiran lapped up the fluids, still going further and further. Minutes passed and the sensation grew stronger inside Gatril along with her moans. Her body writhed as the contracting waves between her legs strengthened.
“Kiran…I think…I think I feel it cumming!”
Kiran reached for a bowl and placed it beneath her. He made strong sucking motions, until finally she came.
The discharge was equivalent to a burst artery, spewing a huge amount of strong smelling, viscous fluid into Kiran’s mouth. He quickly spat it into the bowl along with the rest that poured from her.
The small bowl was filled halfway, but more than what Kiran was expecting. “Whoa!” he said.
Gatril relaxed and caught her breath. She became so comfortable that she almost went to sleep. But there was more to be done.
