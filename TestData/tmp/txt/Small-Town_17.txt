“Max Fields, lovely to meet you.”
He puts his hands in his pockets and sways on his feet. I look at Sam to see that she's still staring.
Knew it!
“How was football, Sam?”
Sam touches her hair and slowly takes her eyes away from Max to look at me. “It would have been good if our teacher actually showed up.”
“She didn't show up?”
It better not be a repeat of Mr. Daniels.
“No, apparently Mrs. Lewis is on maternity leave so we're not gonna have football for the next few months.” “That sucks.”
“Yeah, well I'm starving and I'm dying to know all about Max.”
I quietly chuckle when I see Sam pulling Max towards the cafeteria, and just as I start to catch up, I see Ryder leaning against the wall staring daggers at me.
After last night, I've got nothing to say to him, but when I pass him without saying a word, I can feel him walking behind me.
“What the hell is your problem?” I turn and place my hands firmly on my hips.
He puts up both of his hands. “I just wanted to apologise about last night.”
“Which part do you want to apologise for? And you're apologising to me a lot lately.”
“I just want to get along with you Alice. Is that so hard to believe?”
“Look, I tried explaining to you about what happened that night, but you decided to cut me off. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's your fault that you didn't get what you wanted. So, for that, you can piss off.”
“Who's the new guy?” I look into his eyes but I can't make out his expression.
“He's new to the school.”
Ryder puts his hands in his pockets. “I saw him walking out with you.”
“What's that got to do with you?”
He clenches his jaw. “I'm not gonna leave you alone. You're gonna need me for the next change, and whenever that is, I'm gonna make sure that I'm there to help you. I don't care what you say, but I'll be there to make sure that you survive.”
I don't get a chance to respond because I feel another presence joining our little conversation. Ryder's head comes up and he's looking sternly at Max.
“Alice, I thought we lost you.” Max pulls out his hand and introduces himself to Ryder. “Hey man, I'm Max Fields.”
Ryder ignores him and walks away.
“What's his problem?” Max watches Ryder as he walks away with a look of confusion on his face.
“Yeah, that's Ryder.” I answer.
I watch Ryder walking towards his friends who are sitting at a bench near the football field.
“Were you two a thing or...?”
“Are you kidding me?” I burst out laughing. “No, we've never been a thing.”
And never will be.
Max and I make our way towards the cafeteria, but as I walk through the doors I can't help but feel like I'm being watched. I stand corrected when I look towards the picnic benches located outside and see Ryder, Bane, Kellan and Silver's eyes on me. Are they worried I'm going to tell Max about them? About what they are? It's not even my secret to tell.
I walk into the crowded cafeteria, and the first thing I smell is all the different foods that have been prepared for us.
I can hear all kinds of chit chattering that are going on around me, I can see people laughing, gossiping, fighting and socializing with each other. I see Sam sitting alone on a circular table texting on her phone talking to God knows who.
I sit next to her as Max sits opposite to me. “It's kinda crowded in here don't you think?”
Max looks around the cafeteria, and I can see on his face that he's taking in the different kinds of cliques in the school.
“It's fascinating, isn't it? How you come to school and figure out where you fit in.”
“Did you figure out where you fit in?” Max smirks at me.
I shrug. “Sam and I don't really fit in with these kinds of people. We figured that out early on when we started school. We're a weird pair as you can see.”
“Really?” Max tilts his head. “I mean what kind of people do you have here?”
I point towards the back of the cafeteria. “At the back is where the jocks and cheerleaders sit. They consider themselves as being the top of the food chain.”
“They think they're better than everyone else?” Max frowns.
Sam puts her phone down and crosses her arms over the table. “To them, we are beneath them and nothing more than dog shit.”
Max looks behind him to look at the jocks and stares for a while. “No one should feel like dog shit.”
Sam snickers. “Yeah, try telling that to them.”
Sam stands and grabs her purse. “I'm gonna grab some lunch and if I remember correctly, it's curry day today which means salad for me. Fucking yay.”
As Sam walks to the salad bar, a few of the jocks from the back wolf whistle. I can't help but laugh when I see Sam turn to the back to give them the middle finger.
“What's that all about?” Max comes to sit next to me.
“Sam used to cheerlead believe it or not. She used to be captain too, but those girls back there didn't want her to be their captain because she got all the male attention from the guys.”
“I thought girls liked attention?” Max nudges me. “Not Sam. She prefers to pick someone that she wants male attention from. She'd rather chase than be chased.”
“What happened after that?”
“All the girls on the team complained to the coach that they didn't want someone they didn't like to be their captain. I mean, if you were a coach what would you do? Keep most of the team happy and get rid of one cheerleader, or keep one cheerleader and the rest of the team quitting?” I shrug. “So, Sam left to keep the team happy. She was kinda upset when she left but then she got introduced to football, and she loves it.”
“It's their loss. And what about you?” “What about me?” I tilt my head and smile. “Do you play football?”
“God no! You'll never see me playing football or anything involving running.”
Both of us are laughing by the time Sam comes back. She looks at the two of us like we're crazy. She puts her tray down and sits next to me.
“What's so funny?” Sam picks up her fork and starts digging into her lunch.
“Max was asking me if I play football.”
Sam starts choking on her food. “Alice playing football? You've gotta be kidding me. You could pay her thousands of money and she wouldn't do it.”
“Yeah, well, I wouldn't wanna play football after seeing photos of you with a red face and your nostrils flaring.”
I will never get those images out of my head.
“Football is an intense game. You either play properly or stay away from the pitch.” Sam turns to Max. “Do you play football?”
He clears his throat. “Not anymore but I used to play.”
“Do you do any kind of sport?” She goes back to eating her food.
“You play basketball, right?” I look at Max to see him smirking at me.
“Yeah, I do.”
“See? I listen.” I pull out my purse and stand from the table. “You wanna grab some lunch with me?”
“Sure.” Max stands from the table and follows me to the line for the hot food.
As we wait in the line together, I feel this shiver down my back and turn to look at the cafeteria door to see Ryder, Bane and Silver walking towards an empty table right next to ours.
They sit down, Silver sits next to Ryder with Bane on his other side. Kellan's nowhere to be seen.
“So, where do they fit in?” Max motions with his head to the newcomers.
“They kind of stick to themselves.” I turn back to look at Max. “But, honestly? I don't know. I mean, it's not difficult to see the goths, the nerds, the skaters and the rich kids, but them? They don't really have a name for themselves, but everyone stays away from them. They kind of have a reputation.”
I doubt calling them the wolf gang would go down well. Both of us have the curry, pay and go back to sit down.
“Right, I've gotta go and catch up on homework before Math starts. You're working tonight are you?” Sam picks up her bag and stands from the table holding her tray.
“Yeah, but I'm only working till six tonight.” I take a sip of my drink.
“Oh yeah, you finish school early on Wednesdays.” Sam pouts. “You lucky bitch, alright see you tomorrow.”
I wave goodbye and pick up my fork.
“I didn't know you worked?” I notice Max's half empty plate.
“Uh yeah, I work at the diner next to the forest.”
“The forest? That's kind of an odd place to have a diner.”
“It's actually a really nice place to work. It's out of the way and most days it's really quiet.”
I start eating my food when again I feel people staring. “I'll come to visit you sometime then.”
As Max pulls out his phone, I turn around and come face to face with Silver.
“Why are you all staring at me?” I make sure to keep my voice low enough so that Max doesn't hear me.
“What makes you think we're looking at your ugly ass? You're nothing special to look at.” Silver sneers.
“Silver.” Ryder warns from beside her.
She huffs, turns around and takes out her phone. “Ryder...”
“Remember what I said.”
He stands from the table and leaves with his Betas in tow. I sigh and turn back around.
“Everything okay?” Max looks at me with concern on his face.
“Yeah, everything's fine.” I stand from the table and grab my bag off the floor. “If you want I can show you where the basketball court and gym is?”
He looks at my half-eaten plate. “You've barely eaten anything.”
“I've lost my appetite.”
We leave both of our trays on the table and leave the cafeteria.
Our school campus is huge and there would be no way in hell that Max could find the gym on his own. I lead him towards the back of the campus where the football pitch and the basketball court is, and see people there already changed for practice including Ryder, Bane and Kellan. I ignore them and move to the door leading to the changing rooms.
“So, here we are. The changing rooms are through there and there's another door on the end leading to coach's office.”
“Thank you so much for this. I know that you've got better things to do.”
I'd rather be here than anywhere else actually.
“It's fine, honestly.” I sigh. “'I'm heading to work now anyway.”
I pull the strap of my bag tighter against me.
What am I supposed to do now? Hug him? High five him? Do a thumbs up?
“Alright, then. See you tomorrow?” I smile, “Absolutely.”
Just as I turn around to leave, I hear Max laughing behind me.
“I would've high fived you if you wanted to.” With a smile, I roll my eyes, and keep walking.
Chapter 8

That evening when I arrive at the diner, it's the same as it's always been. Practically empty.
I'm surprised to see that Robbie's actually working for once. He's seated himself behind the cashier speaking on the phone. He waves to me just as I pass him to go into the changing rooms.
I quickly change into my black shorts, my red t-shirt, white apron and tidy my braid before going out into the diner.
I grab an order pad and stand at an elderly couple's table.
“Good afternoon, can I take your order?” I smile at the old man who's squinting at the specials.
I chuckle and read out the specials, “The specials today are the vegetable soup, curry, chilli con carne, squid and bolognese.”
“What's the curry, dear?” The old woman asks. “We have Korma, Rogan Josh or the Pasanda.”
“Richard, shall we have the Rogan Josh?” He mumbles just as the woman answers, “We'll have the Rogan Josh please, dear.”
“No problem. The wait shouldn't be too long, okay?”
I take their menus, walk into the kitchen where I see Terry singing along to the radio.
“Hey, Terry.” I place the order on the stand. “You okay?” “I'm alright thank you, Alice.”
He flips over a pancake and catches it in the pan.
I take a deep breath. “Terry, I'm sorry you had to witness that the other night.” I wince just remembering about it.
“I won't have some little shit shout at you like that, Alice.” Terry slams the pan back on the stove a little too hard. “You gotta stick up for yourself.”
“What do you suggest I do?” I cross my arms over my chest and smile warmly.
“Kick'em where it hurts the most.” He whistles. “Right in the fucking balls.”
I chuckle. “Noted.”
I'm smiling by the time I walk out the kitchen but it vanishes when I see who's occupying the bar stools. Ryder's already sneering at me while Kellan pretends to read the menu.
“Don't even pretend that you're reading that.” I take the menu from him.
Kellan frowns at me. “Everything okay?”
“What do you think? I'm being followed around and it's driving me insane! If you think I'm going to tell Max about you, then you don't know me at all. I won't tell him anything.”
Out of nowhere, Ryder slams his hand on the counter, “I don't give a shit if you tell him or not!”
Everything falls silent in the diner.
“Why do you have such a problem with him?” “Guys, calm down.” Kellan looks warily between us.
“You barely know the guy and you're already sticking up for him!?” Ryder spits.
“He's been nothing but polite to you! How dare you!” I hiss.
Ryder gets out of his seat and comes to stand face to face with me.
“Stay away from him.” He points at me. “I don't give a fuck if he's polite or not. I don't trust him and I won't tell you again. Stay away from him if you know what's good for you.”
“Who the hell do you think you are telling me to stay away from Max?” I lower my voice. “I am not part of your pack and I never will be. Don't ever tell me what I can and cannot do ever again.”
Just as I finish talking Robbie appears behind Ryder.
“I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, son,.” Robbie places his hand on Ryder's shoulder which he nudges off and storms out of the diner.
“Alright, nothing to see here folks.” Robbie walks back into his office.
I look at Kellan to see that he hasn't moved. “Not following your Alpha like you're supposed to?” I pick up a cloth and start wiping down the counter.
“Nah, I'm quite hungry actually.”
“What's his problem Kellan? If someone's going to tell me what's up with him, then it's you.”
“Why me?”
I shrug. “You're the nice wolf.”
Kellan sighs and clears his throat. “Ryder's just protecting you. You may not think that he is but he's just looking out for you. It's sad really because all he wants to do is protect everyone.”
“What do you mean by that?”
“Well, the night I was bitten was the night that Ryder saved my life. I was at a grocery store buying all kinds of junk food as all teenagers do. I saw Ryder there and I obviously didn't know what he was. I was waiting in the line to get served when this man came in dressed in black wearing a ski mask. I knew this guy was going to rob the place and I wasn't gonna have that being a cops' son.
Ryder was standing quite far from where I was, and I started talking to the guy in the mask, trying to calm him down to talk him out of it. Normally, robbers are calm and they know exactly what they're doing, but he didn't. He was scared. He didn't know what the hell he was doing.
Anyway, he panicked and shot me right in the chest.
Ryder dragged me out of the store, into the nearest alley, and he told me I was gonna die if I didn't accept what he was offering. All I could think about was my dad and I had my answer.”
“He bit you.” I sigh. “Does your dad know what you are?”
Kellan shakes his head. “No, and I'd like to keep it that way.”
“And the man in the mask, did he escape?” “Yeah.”
I pause for a second. “Kellan, do you mind if I ask you a question?”
“Anything.”' He answers without looking at me.
“The other night at my house, why were your eyes different from Bane and Silver's?”
Kellan puts the menu down, “I was turned less than a year ago, a few months after Anna's death. When Ryder changed me, he wanted me in his pack, but after losing Anna I just wanted to be left alone. Ryder would check up on me at school, to see if I was okay and he always told me that he'd be there whenever I needed him. A couple of weeks later, I decided to go and see him and that's when I met Bane and Silver. Ryder wasn't there and it was obvious that they didn't want me anywhere near him or the pack. So, they did what Betas do. They forced me out of the pack.”
I frown. “Can they do that?”
“As second in commands they can. Ryder didn't know anything about it until he asked them why my scent was there, and they told him. I was on my own for a while keeping to myself and keeping away from everyone. That didn't last because Ryder told me about how Omegas don't survive on their own, and he brought me back to his pack. And for my eyes? They're yellow because I'm the weaker one out of them all. For example, if we're fighting with another pack, they can see who the easier target is, that being me, but my eyes will change eventually.”
“Wait, are you the only pack in Small Town?” I wheeze.
“No, Alice there are thousands of us.” Kellan smirks, “And soon you'll be one.”
I shake my head. “If I survive, which I probably won't.”
Kellan gets up from his seat. “Ryder is going to do anything he can to help you survive. Fighting the first change was a huge mistake. The next time you change, you're gonna experience a whole lot of pain, or even die.”
Thanks, Kellan. That doesn't make me feel better at all.
“Why does Ryder feel like he needs to be there for me all the time? He doesn't owe me anything.”
Kellan tenses his jaw and drops his head. “Because the same thing happened to his sister.”
Ryder had a sister?
Wait. What?
Kellan clears his throat. “A while back, Ryder and his family were camping out in the woods. Ryder and his parents changed frequently into wolves, but his sister fought every change because she feared that she'd lose control. Doing so made her weak. The night was a full moon, and Ryder and his parents knew how to control the change, but his sister was wondering around the woods, probably gathering more wood for the fire, but she didn't come back for a while and Ryder couldn't understand where she'd gone. It turned out that she did turn, but she barely managed it on her own.” Kellan clears his throat again. “She ran for miles and ended up by the creak. Anna was found ripped to shreds by the river. They were too late.”
Ryder and Anna were brother and sister!?
“Anna..?” I gasp, “Your Anna?”
“Anna thought she was adopted because she looked nothing like Ryder, but she meant everything to the two of us.”
“Kellan, I'm so sorry.”
“You'd never guess that they were related so no one asked about it. That's why Ryder's just trying to make people understand that changing isn't such a bad thing.” Kellan shrugs. “I mean, sure we look scary and lose control when it's a full moon but that's not every night. He just doesn't want the same happening to you as it did with Anna.”
“I fought the change because I didn't want to hurt anybody.” I quietly say.
“You won't hurt anyone Alice because you've got me and Ryder looking out for you.”
He grabs my hand gently and strokes his thumb against my skin. “'We won't let you hurt anyone, I promise.”
He lets go of my hand and collects his bag off the floor. “How was basketball?”
Kellan doesn't answer me straight away. “Me and Ryder left before it started to come here to talk to you.”
I snort. “You mean, to warn me.”
Kellan shakes his head and sighs. “I can't make you listen to me, but please listen to Ryder. Stay away from the new kid.”
“Not you too, Kellan.” I snort. “What is it about Max that you don't like?”
“Please Alice, just listen.” Kellan stays still for a moment but when he sees that I have no response, he turns and leaves the diner.
Listening to Kellan talk about his life as being a wolf and the truth about Anna, I realise that I have no idea what these guys have been through. What if what Kellan says is true? That Ryder's just trying to protect me. From what exactly? Max? He's been nothing but kind to me and he seems harmless.
I'm walking to the kitchen when I hear Robbie calling my name from his office.
“Alice, can you come in here for a second?” “Everything okay?” I lean my hip against the door.
Robbie turns in his chair and slicks his greasy hair back. “What was that all about earlier?”
I look at the floor. “Just a misunderstanding. I'm sorry, it won't happen again.”
“I know, Alice but I just can't have that in the diner, okay?”
He dismisses me by turning in his chair and going back on the computer.
Walking into the kitchen, I see Terry finishing off the couple's curry. I carefully carry the steaming hot plates to them.
After serving the remaining customers, I say goodbye to Terry and Robbie, change out of my uniform and leave the diner.
Working five days a week isn't so bad. I was lucky enough to get Fridays and Saturdays off. Some days I truly love working there because it gives me the freedom of not having to worry about anything - that was until I didn't have to worry about becoming a wolf.
Now I'm living in fear that I'll change at the worst possible moment.
When I arrive home, the house is silent and all the lights are off, my mother's probably still at work. I go upstairs, take a shower, change into my nightwear and walk downstairs to heat up some soup in the microwave.
After today I don't think I can eat much. The moment the soup heats up I take it upstairs and into my bedroom.
Chapter 9

When I arrive at school the next morning, I wonder what kind of day is in store for me. Hopefully, it will be a straightforward day.
I walk through the corridor to my English class to see Sam already there, on her phone. Again.
“You're always on that thing.” I frown. Who could she possibly be speaking to?
She puts her phone in her pocket and smirks. “I'm casually stalking an acquaintance of ours.”
“And who would that be? We've got a few of those recently.” I adjust the straps on my dungarees and put my hands in the pockets.
“Bane obviously.” Sam gives me this look as if she's saying to me, 'who else could it have been?'
“Okay, here's a question, why?”
“I think you know why.” Sam wiggles her brows.
I roll my eyes, she can't be serious. “Sam, you think that just because you've seen his genitals, you can stalk him?”
Sam's eyes widen. “Alice he is hung and I mean really hung. At this point, I don't even care about the fact that he turns into a wolf.”
I shake my head, look down at the other end of the corridor to see Ryder leaning against the lockers, looking in our direction.
“I'm so gonna rock his world one day.” Sam takes out her phone again with a big smile on her face.
“What exactly are you stalking him on?” I look back at her.
Her eyes are glued to the phone. “Everything.”
I'm laughing by the time she finishes talking. “You have a serious problem.”
Sam shrugs. “It's only wrong if he finds out.”
“And when he does? Then what?” I arch my brow waiting for her answer.
Sam shrugs. “I'm not gonna apologise if that's what you wanna hear.”
I shake my head and roll my eyes when I see Mr. Edmund advancing in our direction. He unlocks the door and places himself in front of the whiteboard. He looks at each person individually as they come into the classroom, but stares coldly at the four who are last to enter the room.
“Don't take your seats yet everyone. We're going to have a little change in the classroom today because I feel that the people in the back are not concentrating as they should be.” He crosses his arms and looks towards the back.
“Right, can I have Kellan come sit next to Alice in the front here? Sam move to the next desk please,.” Kellan comes to sit next to me in the front. Our desk is in the middle with one desk on either side.
Kellan nudges me in greeting, I smile in response.
“Bane? Get your feet off the table now, I won't tell you again and come sit next to Sam please.”
Mr. Edmund stands in front of Sam's desk, waits for Bane to sit down and leans into his face. “I will not tolerate this kind of behaviour in my classroom, Bane. I can easily fail you at the end of the year seeing that every test you've done you've managed to fail. Congratulations, your parents must be so proud.”
Mr. Edmund leans down closer to him. “Don't give me a reason to kick you out of my class because mark my words Bane, I want you out. Failures are not welcomed in my classroom.”
Mr. Edmund may think that no one can hear him but there are four wolves in here that can clearly hear him. I can hear clearly but I'm sitting close by. The rest of the class would think that Mr. Edmund's just giving Bane a warning, but they don't know the real meaning of what's being said. What's gotten into him?
When I look over at Bane I see that his jaw is tensed firmly and his eyes look deadly. I look him over and see that his fist is clenched tightly under the desk; out of sight. I look more closely to see blood dripping from inside his palm - caused by his razor-sharp claws. I look up in panic hoping that Mr. Edmund hasn't noticed, but his attention has gone back to the classroom.
He points to the back. “Ryder and Silver in the front. Now. Liam and Luna go to the back. The middle row is fine as far as I'm concerned.”
Mr. Edmund waits until everyone is seated and clears his throat. “Now I won't be able to stay for the rest of the lesson because a new student was in an incident here yesterday, and I have to leave to speak with him. I don't know what happened but that person has been severely hurt. I'll be back as soon as possible.”
He collects his things and heads for the door. “I don't want anyone leaving this classroom under any circumstance. If I hear that any student has left this classroom, I will gladly mark every test paper of theirs an F.” He turns and leaves out the door without another word.
As soon as the classroom door closes, everyone starts to talk amongst themselves. I hear Mr Edmund's name mentioned several times. They're probably wondering the same thing as everyone else. What happened to him that's suddenly made him want to change the room around and behave this way?
I look back at Bane to see his eyes are closed tightly, sweat knits his forehead and he's taking deep breaths. Sam is talking to someone behind her and I can hear behind me that Kellan's talking to Silver and Ryder.
I slowly reach up with my hand and carefully place my hand on Bane's shoulder. The second it makes contact, his eyes immediately swing to me and stares motionless at me.
“Bane?” I whisper.
He stares at me but remains silent. I lean in closer. “Bane?”
“I'm....try...trying.....to control..my...myself.”He grunts. “Do you need me to do anything? Do you need some air?”
“One more word and I'll shift. Leave me the hell alone.” He growls and rushes out of the classroom so fast hardly anyone notices his absence.
Leaning back in my seat, Kellan turns away from Ryder and Silver. I notice the three of them frowning when they realize that Bane is nowhere to be seen.
“Where's Bane?”
Ryder rounds my desk, leans down to me and snaps, “What the hell did you say to him to make him run off like that?”
I didn't expect this kind of response from Ryder. “Excuse me? You think I'm the reason he's gone?”
“You're the one who spoke to him last. I was watching you.”
He snarls at me.
Kellan sees the confused look on my face. “It's not her fault. It was the teacher's.”
Ryder takes one more look at me and storms out of the classroom.
Kellan places his hand on my back comfortingly. Too bad I'm not up for a back rub.
“Don't take it seriously.”
“He's trying to protect me?” I place my bag over my shoulder. “What a load of shit.”
“Alice, you okay?” Sam looks at me with worry etched on her face.
“Yeah, I'll speak to you later.”
I rush out of the classroom and out towards the back of the school, to the empty football field.
When I reach the field, I slowly take a deep breath, hold it and release it.
There's no explaining my escape to Mr Edmund if he ever finds out. Who am I kidding? He's never gonna know.
I sit on the dry cut grass and look up at the sky.
Being alone with my thoughts is actually quite peaceful, but I can't help but wonder who was hurt last night. Could it be someone that I know? But I hope that whoever got hurt isn't suffering too much.
And Bane? I hope he shifts and never changes back. Never will I understand the reason he is the way that he is. The same goes for all of them except for Kellan.
Since last night, I feel like I understand Kellan a lot better.
It's still hard to believe that Anna was Ryder's sister. They looked nothing alike and yet I didn't have the pleasure of meeting her or getting to know her. From what I remember, Anna was nothing like Ryder; the complete opposite. I dread to think what happened when they found her body.
Who would do such an animalistic thing?
I must have been thinking really hard because I don't hear the person shouting my name from behind me. I turn around and from afar I see a lone figure standing on crutches. I squint my eyes to see who it is but it's too blurry to make out the person. I look around to see if it was my name that was being called, but realises there's only me outside.
I stand and walk towards the figure.
When I come somewhat closer to the person, I don't expect that person to be Max.
What the hell?
When I stand in front of Max, I'm completely speechless. His whole face was black and blue.
Black eyes circle around his eyes, his right cheek is badly bruised and his lips are twice the size of yesterday with nasty looking cuts on both sides of his lips. Not to mention that he's on crutches with god knows how many bruises underneath his clothes.
“Hey, you.” Max smiles at me.
How can he smile beneath his beaten face? “Max.	what?”
Max looks down at the ground. “You noticed the face, huh?”
“It's kind of hard not to notice, and it's not just the face.”
I gasp when I look down to see that his foot is in a cast. “What happened to you?”
He shrugs. “Basketball's a rough sport and people get hurt.”
I frown.
Is he being serious?
“Not rough enough to look like this!?” Max says nothing.
“Did.	did someone do this to you?”
Who would do this to a new student? It just doesn't make sense.
Max laughs nervously. “Of course not, Alice. I told you what happened.”
Why is a part of me not believing him?
“Right. Basketball.” I place my hands in my pockets and look at him unconvincingly.
“You don't believe me?” Max frowns. “I don't know what to say.”
“Max, look at yourself! You've clearly been beaten up!” I shriek. “Who would do such a thing to you?”
Again Max says nothing. “Max?”
Max pauses for a second. “I didn't wanna say anything.” “About what?”
Max clears his throat and looks away from me. “Something happened yesterday.”
“At school?” He nods.
“When you left yesterday, I went into the changing rooms to change into my kit, and I heard the door closing a few minutes after I stepped in. Before I knew it, I was jumped from behind, and I couldn't defend myself being that I was outnumbered.”
“Did you see who it was?”
“Yeah.” He looks up at me. “It was Ryder and the two guys who hang around with him.”
“What!?”
Max shrugs. “Look, don't worry about it. It's my problem, not yours, okay? I don't know the reason why it happened.”
None of this makes sense to me. Why would Ryder target someone like Max?
“I just don't understand why he'd do this to you.”
Max chuckled. “It's obvious, isn't it? He wants me to stay away from you.”
I can't help but roll my eyes. Ryder had no right to do this.
“Max...I don't know what to say other than I'm so sorry. Ryder and I are nothing to each other. I hope this doesn't interfere with our friendship.”
“Of course, it doesn't, Alice. I just wanted to see you even though I look like shit.”
“Yeah, you do.”
Before I know it we're both laughing.
After what feels like minutes of laughing I remember the notes I have for Max in my bag. I open it and grab my pink flowery folder.
“I'm sorry I didn't give these to you yesterday. It was kind of a hectic day.”
Max looks at the folder and frowns. “What's this?”
“My Biology notes that Mr. Thompson asked me to print out for you.”
“Oh right. Thanks.”
He takes the folder and holds it.
How is he going to hold the folder if he's on crutches? “You sure you can manage?”
“I'm actually not staying. My mother's coming to pick me up.”
He puts the folder under his arm and puts his hands on the handles.
“Okay. Well, I hope you get better and I'm really sorry about Ryder.”
“Alice, you don't need to apologise on his behalf, besides he obviously sees me as a threat.” Max smirks.
'Yeah, I guess he does.” I chuckle. “'I'll see you soon Max.”
“See ya.”
He turns around and hobbles slowly out of the school.
Watching him walk like that stirs something inside of me. It angers me that Ryder would do such a thing and to outnumber him.
Did Kellan take part in this? Three wolves taking on one harmless, innocent boy.
What a bunch of monsters!
I let my anger take over and rush to where the wolves might possibly be. Knowing Ryder he's probably outside on the basketball court.
I know I'm right when I see three males practising passing the ball completely topless.
Ryder stiffens when he sees me approaching.
He walks towards me with the same snarling look he had pointed at me earlier, but it's time for Ryder to have a piece of my mind because I'm furious.
When I reach him I don't think, I just act.
I slap him hard across the face that instantly causes my palm to sting.
Ryder's face is beyond fury. “What the fuck was that for!?”
“You know damn well what that was for!” I point my finger right into his face.
“What the hell are you talking about?” He spits. “Don't lie, Ryder! Not to me!”
My body is shaking with so much fury that I can barely look at him let alone seeing him without a shirt on.
Ryder steps closer to me and I can hear him growling. “You think I'd lie to you?”
“Explain Max's injuries then! Why did you do it?”
He looks taken aback. “I don't know what you're talking about.”
I shove at his chest. A chest that is so unbelievably solid that he doesn't move.
“Stop lying to me! You know exactly what you did to Max.”
Ryder takes both of my hands and pins them behind my back. “I've done nothing to him.”
Bane and Kellan run towards us. They're both probably wondering what's keeping their Alpha, they both wear confused expressions.
“Have you both seen the state of him!?” “What's going on here?” Bane frowns.
I try to struggle out of Ryder's hold but stop when I realise that he's too strong.
“Let go of me!”
He releases me instantly.
I look at each of them individually. “Why did you do it?”
Kellan frowns while Bane still looks confused. “Alice, what are you talking about?”
“Were you a part of this too Kellan?”
I can't help but feel hurt that Kellan might've taken part in this. “Max? The new guy? Ring any bells. You know, the guy you three beat up yesterday.”
Neither of them says a word.
“All three of you are unbelievable, you know that? I didn't expect this from you Kellan, maybe from them but not you!” I can feel my anger rise when I hear Bane and Ryder growl. “You disgust me.”
I turn to leave but not before someone grabs a hold of my arm.
I roll my eyes when I see it's Ryder.
“You've had your chance to speak, now it's my turn to talk.”
He leans into me and brushes his lips over my ear. My whole body shivers as he whispers to me. “Don't ever slap me again otherwise I'll have to do something about it.
Now, for beating up your precious friend, if I remember correctly, Kellan and I were at the diner right after you left yesterday. And for Bane?” Ryder shrugs. “He doesn't give a shit about anybody but seeing as he doesn't know what the hell you're talking about, then I guess you're at a loss here.”
He turns away from me with Bane on his heels.
Kellan remains looking at the ground. “You really think we'd do something like that?”
“Kellan, I don't know what to believe right now, but if you saw the state Max is in then you wouldn't know what to think.”
“Alice, we don't just go around beating people.”
“Then, how do you explain Max's injuries? Did you know that he's on crutches?”
