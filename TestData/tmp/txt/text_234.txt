I scoff. “Of course not. Violence doesn't solve anything. If anything it makes things worse.”
“I couldn't agree more.” Max stays silent for awhile then sighs. “So, what's your next question?”
“You haven't answered this question.”
He frowns. “I did answer it. Did I not tell you about how I recover so fast? But seeing as you chose to ignore that, then I suggest that we're done here.”
“Why have you grown so rude?”
He sighs in annoyance. “Alice, I've only been here a week and people are already calling me a liar. I've been beaten up twice for telling the truth and yet people still accuse me of being a liar. So, I apologise if I appear to be a little pissed off about that.”
I reach for my braid and rest it over my shoulder. 'So, are you saying that everything you've said, is the absolute truth?”
Max grins. “I always tell the truth, and I definitely wouldn't lie to you. Especially you, Alice. We're friends.”
Here it goes.
