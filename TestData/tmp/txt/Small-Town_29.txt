Sam looks between Max and me.
“I just don't want to be in the company of a liar, and after yesterday I don't want to be seen associating with someone like you.”
Sam eyes widen. “Okay, what happened between you two?”
Max and I just look at each other.
“Should I tell her or do you wanna say how you and Ryder broke into my house and interrogated me like I did something wrong?”
“Go ahead and tell her everything about what happened, but I won't be here to listen to you.”
Sam looks at the two of us in confusion. “What the hell's going on? Can someone please explain to me what happened this weekend?”
I point at Max. “He's a liar, Sam. And it's taken us this long to figure that out.”
“Okay, what's he lied about?”
Max scoff. “'I've lied about a number of things apparently.”
“Don't act like you're innocent in all of this.” I spit. “You told me that your mum works at the hospital on the first day you came to school.” I look at Sam. “Friday night, I saw him at the hospital and he looked at me like I was the one that shouldn't have been there. On that same night, I asked my mother if she knew someone with his surname, and she said no.”
“Maybe I had a reason for going to the hospital that night. Didn't you ever think of that?”
I scoff. “And you couldn't have said that to me yesterday?”
He shakes his head. “I couldn't even think straight yesterday.”
My voice shakes. “Whatever. Keep up the lies, Max because I'm done trying to understand you. You've had so many chances to talk to me about the truth but you didn't even try once. There's something that you're not telling us and for whatever reason that might be, you've already lost me as a friend.” I gather my things and walk away until Sam stands too. “Why would you say that your mum works there when she doesn't? Just tell us that.”
“Not you too Sam.” He looks hurt. “But what did I expect? You're obviously gonna stick up for your friend.”
“Then prove us wrong! Here's your chance to rectify yourself.”
Max just stares at her without saying anything. “Well?”
He just ignores her, causing Sam to shake her head in regret. “I honestly thought you were better than this, but it's obvious that you're not the person I thought you were.”
She grabs her bag and walks with me through the exit of the cafeteria.
We walk in silence to her car when realisation dawns on Sam. “Why were you at Ryder's house this weekend anyway?”
Now's still not the right time to mention what happened to Terry, and the pictures taken of me. It would only make her worry about what's out there. I'll keep what happened to Terry and the pictures a secret. For now.
“We were just hanging out, that's all.” “So, you weren't with Max this weekend.” “No, I wasn't.”
She nods to herself. “So, it can only be one other person.” I wonder how she'll react when she figures it out.
“You dirty little wolf. You gave up your v-card to Ryder King, didn't you?” She doesn't look surprised at all.
“Don't say it like that.” I wait for her to unlock the car.
Sam grins. “But you did though! And you wanna know something? That night I caught you kissing Ryder in my bedroom, I wondered how long it would take until you two hooked up.”
I roll my eyes. “Sam, open the door.”
She unlocks the door and murmurs. “I wish that a wolf found me attractive enough to sleep with me.” She sighs in disappointment. “'What is happening to the world?”
When I arrive at my home, I call in sick at work and take out today's homework. I take out the book Mr. Edmund gave for us today and start reading. The story centres on a father and his complicated relationship with his troubled teenaged boy.
From the very first page, I'm so engrossed by the story that I don't hear the phone ringing. I leave the book on the coffee table and hastily walk to the phone.
I pick it up but silence is met on the other end. “Hello?” I ask.
There's only silence. “Hello?” I repeat.
The sound of my mother's voice speaks. “You need to come to the hospital, honey.”
I frown even though she can't see me. “Is everything okay?”
“I need you to come here right now!”
Why does she sound like she's on the verge of crying?
“Mum? What's wrong?” My voice starts to shake with worry.
She sniffs again. “It's Sam, honey.”
I hear my heart beating in my throat and I feel as though I might throw up.
“Is she okay?”
“She's been attacked, and it's not looking good.” And that's when the tears start to fall.
Chapter 23

I push through the hospital doors with only one thing on my mind, finding Sam. When I reach the reception area, there's not a single word I can utter but her name.
The receptionist looks at me worryingly. “Young lady? Are you alright?”
“Sam...” I repeat over and over.
Everyone stares at me in pity, they're probably wondering what the hell is wrong with me. No one would understand the shit I've been through this week.
My mother soon finds me, pulls me into her chest and that's when the tears start to fall again. We hold each other for a few minutes.
I break away from her, with a look of desperation in my eyes. I need to see Sam with my own eyes and maybe then I'll be able to speak.
She leads me through the hospital to where they're keeping her when unexpectedly, I see Ryder, Kellan, Bane and Silver standing outside her door, wearing expressionless looks on their faces.
“What are you all doing here?” I don't understand why they're here.
Ryder answers me straight away. “We found her lying on the floor, next to her car.”
“And that's enough of a reason for you all to be here?” I look at each of them individually.
My mother grabs a hold of my hand. “Honey, they brought Sam in. Without their help, god knows what would've happened to her.”
There's nothing anyone can say to make me feel any better at this point. After losing Terry, a person I cared about, it's made me realise that anything can happen when you least expect it, and I don't want to lose somebody else.
“None of you care about her, so please just leave.” I pass the four of them and enter the room Sam is being held in, there's nothing I want more than to just see and hear her breathe.
She lies motionless in the curtained cubicle with only the sounds of the machines encompassing around the room. My mother said to me on the phone that she's suffered a severe blow to the head, resulting in a fractured skull, bruising and bleeding within the brain. She also told me that Sam has a few broken ribs from the attack.
I walk and stand beside her and reach with my hand to hold hers. With her eyes closed and her chest rising and falling ever so slowly, I can finally feel assured that she's alive.
The door opens and in walks my mother, she comes to stand beside me.
“If it wasn't for them Alice, she could've died.” She whispers to me.
I can only look at Sam. “Mum, don't say things like that.”
She turns to me. “I'm sorry honey, but those people out there have a right to be here.”
“They don't care about Sam.”
My mother holds my hand. “They brought her here and that shows to me that they care.”
I consider her words. “Then they were at the right place at the right time.”
“She's lucky, I'll tell you that.” She sighs and shakes her head. “But why would someone want to hurt her like this?”
I shrug. “I don't know.”
“Well, whatever the reason, she didn't deserve it.”
The two of us just look at Sam in silence. We're both probably wondering the same thing, who could've done something like this and why?
“Did you call her parents?” I ask.
My mother nods. “They left just before you came. They said something about leaving and coming back with a few things that Sam might need. She'll be here for awhile.”
“How long?”
“I wish I could tell you honey, but I honestly have no idea. We'll see how long when she wakes up.” She goes to walk out of the room when she stops. “Oh, that reminds me.
When her parents came here, they asked if you could drive her car from the school back to their house.”
I frown. “From the school? But she brought me home in her car, why would she go back to school?”
My mum shrugs. “Maybe she forgot something. I'm going to grab my coat, so why don't you say goodbye to Sam for now and we'll get her car together.”
I lean over Sam, brush her hair away from her forehead and kiss her. “I wish I didn't have to go but I'll come and see you tomorrow. I'll be here when you wake up.”
Just as I turn away from her, Ryder stands just inside the room with his hands in his pockets.
“What are you still doing here? I thought I told you to leave.” I cross my arms over my chest.
“I wasn't going to leave without asking if you were okay first.”
“I'm obviously not okay Ryder! I could've lost Sam tonight, I can't lose somebody else.”
He moves to stand in front of me. “I know. I'm sorry, that was a stupid question to ask.” He reaches for my hand and holds it. 'Is there anything I can do?”
There is something that I've been meaning to ask Ryder, but with everything that's happened, I've never found the right time to ask him. “I want to know why you never cared about me before I was bitten because the moment you started getting involved in my life, was when everything changed.”
“Alice, just because I wasn't involved in your life doesn't mean that I didn't care about you.”
“Yes, but if I hadn't have been bitten, you probably wouldn't even be standing here, right?”
He looks away from me. “Probably not.” He lets go of my hand.
I nod in dismay. “You're unbelievable, you know that?”
He looks at me and frowns. “What do you want me to say, Alice?”
“I want you to say that you didn't care about me when I was a human!?”
“Alice..”
“You didn't, did you? The moment you started caring for me was when it turned out that I was an Alpha too.”
He cups my cheek. “That's not true. I always kept my distance from you. That Monday at school when I could sense another wolf, it finally gave me an excuse to interact with you. It's given me the chance to show you this new gift that you've been given. The bite is a gift, it gives you the ability to hear and smell things that no ordinary person can. Who wouldn't want that?”
I remove his hold on my cheek. “I don't want it and I never will want it either.”
“You can join our pack and we'll all teach you how to embrace this new side of you.”
“I don't want to be in your pack or anyone else's! Don't you get that!? I just want to live my life like a normal person, and if that turns my wolf feral then so be it.”
He shakes his head. “You don't know what you're saying. I know you're hurting because of Sam and Terry, but that shouldn't make you say things like that. You're not thinking clearly.”
I shake my head. “You don't know what I'm thinking right now.”
“Enlighten me then. Maybe then I can understand what it is you're trying to tell me.”
“Okay, then why has it taken this long to find one murderer? You've had all this time to find whoever killed Mr Daniels and Terry, yet you still haven't found who's responsible.”
“Are you trying to say that it's my fault that Terry got killed and Sam got attacked?”
“I'm saying that it's partially your fault.” He looks at me in anger. “How?”
I roll my eyes. “The same person could've done this to Sam! You're a wolf for god's sakes! You said yourself that you've been to every crime scene of where the murders took place and yet you can't find a trace. If I knew how to use my abilities, I wouldn't sleep until the murderer was found.”
He's silent for a few seconds. “I'm just gonna assume that you're only saying that cause you're upset.”
“No Ryder. I'm saying it because you're an Alpha. So, maybe you should start acting like one.” I nudge past him, through the corridor and out the hospital doors where my mother waits for me in the car.
Chapter 24

The drive to the school takes about twenty minutes. The silence in the car gives me the time to think to myself about the last couple of days. I think about the day Terry's body was found and almost losing Sam tonight, and I honestly believe that this day couldn't possibly get any worse.
When we get to school, the car stops just outside the entrance, 'I won't be long.' I unbuckle the seatbelt and open the door.
“Sam's mum told me that her keys might be in her locker considering they weren't found anywhere near the car.”
I nod in understanding. “Okay.”
“Do you want me to wait for you here?”
She's most likely really tired from work so I shake my head. “No, it's okay, go home and rest.”
“I'll see you at home.” She waves and leaves.
I wave back, walk up the steps and into the school. The doors are surprisingly still open at this hour, maybe a few teachers are still here doing last minute preparations for tomorrow.
I walk leisurely down the corridors and eventually arrive at Sam's locker. I grab onto the lock and enter Sam's combination code into it and the latch easily opens. The day we became best friends was also the day Sam and I gave each other's combination code. The reason why we did this was that if we needed anything from each other's lockers, we could always help ourselves.
I look inside Sam's locker in search for her keys but come up empty handed. I check again to make sure that they're there but her keys are nowhere to be found. I close the locker and turn to leave when I see what appears to be a single light ignited in a classroom.
With light footsteps, I draw nearer to the classroom and open the door when I notice that this classroom is familiar.
Who could be here at this hour?
I jerk in surprise when a voice brings me to attention.
“Looking for these?” Sitting in his chair holding a chain of keys on the end of his finger is Mr Edmund.
I peer at the keys he holds. “Are those...Sam's keys?” “Indeed.” He sighs “Kids these days, so irresponsible.”
I frown, confused on why he has her keys. “Why do you have her keys?”
“They merely came into my reach.” He twirls the keys around his fingers and stands. “I presume that you're here to collect them?”
“That's right...”
He stands in front of me and gives me the keys. “How is Sam?” Even though he's asking about her, he looks as though he doesn't care at all.
I snarl. “She's unconscious sir, whoever hit her, hit her pretty hard.”
He turns his back on me. “How awful. You must be worried for your friend.”
“You have no idea. This week hasn't been the best of weeks.”
He looks back at me with a malicious grin. “That I can understand.”
With the keys in my hand, I turn to leave when he calls my name.
“Yes?”
“Tell me, Alice. How do you manage to live life without your father in it?”
What the..?
“Excuse me?”
“I've read your school records, and I was quite surprised by it. We have something in common you and I.”
“We do...?”
He points to himself. “I too haven't met someone who should've been a part of my life, but wasn't.”
Why is he talking with me about this? “Have you never met your father too?”
“No, my son actually, I haven't seen him nineteen years.” He sits down at his desk and takes a book from a drawer. I
notice it's the book we were given today in class.
He has a son?
“Did you have a chance to read this book, Alice?”
I shake my head, shock still registering in my brain. “I read the first couple of chapters and it seems like a very interesting story.”
He looks at the cover in fascination. “This book is one of my favourites.” He turns the book over in his hands and stares at the cover. “You see, this story is about a man who fell in love with this woman from overseas. The man spent months in that country and eventually fell in love with it. One day at a nearby cafe, he noticed this beautiful woman sitting alone reading a book, and he kept asking himself while he was looking at the woman if he had the courage to approach and talk to her. As he was doing that, the woman unexpectedly turned his way and smiled at him, and he felt that was enough of a reason to go to her.” He puts the book down and stares at me. “They were inseparable after that, spent days and nights together and even talked about having a future together, but she knew one day he would have to leave and go back to his own country. When that day came, she surprised him by saying that she would leave with him, and they left together.
Years went by, they got married and even talked about having children. They tried and tried until they were gifted with a beautiful baby boy.” He clears his throat. “But things started to fall apart after that for the man and woman, they started to drift apart. To cut a long story short, she fell in love with another man, who already had a wife and a child. A beautiful baby girl. The father of the girl ran away with the man's wife, taking along her son with them. The man never saw his son again, and the father never saw his daughter again.”
“Do you know what happens next in the book?”
He sighs. “That I do not, I've never read this book before.” He picks up the book and throws it in the bin placed next to the desk.
What?
“Then, what were you just talking about?” I have no idea what's going on.
“I was telling you about my life story, sad isn't it?” He stares intensely at me.
I look around, avoiding eye contact with him. “I don't know what you want me to do with this new information.”
He shrugs. “Do with it what you will.”
There's one thing I am curious about though. If Mr Edmund was the man with the son, who was the man with the daughter?
“Ask me the question you want to be answered, Alice.”
I look back at him, he grins at me. “Who was the man with the daughter.”
He chuckles. “Can you really not guess? Surely you know the answer to that.”
Why do I feel like it's related to me?
He nods. “Your father fell in love with my wife, and he left you and your mother to raise my son.” He emphasizes my.
I hear my heart beating in my throat. “No...”
“Yes, yes, yes!” He slams the desk with every yes. “Did you ever wonder where he was all these years? He's been overseas raising my son like his own, but can you imagine how happy I was when I learned that the man who took the woman I loved away from me had a daughter, in this very school.”
My eyes start to water. “I've got nothing to do with this. I hate my father for leaving me and my mother.”
He looks at me in pity. “He took away something from me Alice, and now I'm taking something away from him.” He stands from his chair.
I tremble from my position in the door and watch as Mr Edmund starts to breathe heavily when the sound of bones stretches the silence in the classroom. His jaw suddenly dislocates and develops into a vicious fanged mouth and soon after, his entire face structure transformers into a wolf, when hair starts to appear all over his body, I gasp in horror when I see that his eyes have turned blood red.
I whimper in absolute fright when it suddenly occurs to me that the colour of this wolf's fur looks oddly familiar - the dull shade of grey with big chunks of the fur missing, and the scars on its entire body. I feel like screaming when I realize that this wolf was the one that bit me the night of the full moon.
This all happened because of him.
When the wolf starts to prowl closer to me I know exactly what its intent is. I run out of the classroom door and down the corridor when the wolf lets out an ear bursting howl behind me, causing my heart to beat rapidly inside my chest. I exit out of the school with Sam's keys in my hands and run to the only car left in the lot. I manage to pick the right key and unlock the car in record speed. I see the wolf run out the doors of the school just as I close the door.
I turn on the ignition, drive away from the school and start to head home, breaking every speed limit along the way.
It takes me half an hour to drive home, and when it comes into view, I let out a sigh of relief. I stop the car and rest my head against the steering wheel. I stay in that position for a few minutes to steady my heart and breathing.
I turn my head to look at the house and notice that the front door has been left open.
Why would my mother leave the door wide open?
I exit the car and run to the doorway but stop when I see the house in complete disarray.
“Mum?”
I wait for her response but not even a sound is to be heard inside the house. I check outside to see if her car is there and frown when I see her car parked in the driveway.
Where did she go?
I worryingly walk inside the house and enter the living area when I suddenly slide on something on the floor. I lower my head and immediately start to feel nauseous when I see a trail of footprints covered in blood, leading out into the garden, additionally I start to think the worst.
“Mum!?” I yell.
With my heart beating inside my ears, I run to the door leading to the garden with trembling legs and let out a bloodcurdling scream.
“No.” I repeat to myself while shaking my head.
My eyes glisten with tears when I stare at a body floating face down in the swimming pool. The colour of the water no longer blue, but the colour red.
I pray that this isn't who I think it is, but something tells me that I know exactly who's lying in the pool.
With unsteady feet, I drag my feet closer to the pool - my heart breaking with every step I take.
Crouching at the pool's edge where the body floats nearer to me, I reach to pull the body out of the water and notice by the colour of her hair and the clothes that she wore to work this morning, that this is the person that brought me into this world.
With all the strength I have, I pull her out of the water and rest her gently on my thighs.
As I look at her, lying motionless in my arms, there's only this numb feeling inside of me.
Why would someone want to do this to my mother?
My mother, who was a good and kind person to others around her, a person who hasn't had the best life, raising me all on her own without a father, I wouldn't have been the person that I am right now if it wasn't for her.
I lean over her with trembling lips, kiss her gently on her cheek and rock her lightly in my arms, while the tears continue to fall.
Recognition filters on my mind, that the person I love the most in this world, has been taken away from me forever, and all I can do is scream.
 



Chasing the Omega
(Small Town #1)

Jessica Edwards
Chapter 1

Tonight hasn't been so bad. I mean, you have good days and bad days, right? Sundays are usually quiet around here but it's not so bad really.
The regulars are kind and generous with their tips, and even my boss Robbie isn't so bad. He's a little on the lazy side and stares a little too long at my backside, but he always pays on time and lets me take any leftover food home with me.
I look up at the old round clock hung up on the wall and sigh in contempt.
Only half an hour to go.
I stare at the last customer of the night and pray silently that he's close to finishing. I grab the coffee pot, walk with a forced smile and approach the customer.
“More coffee, sir?” I plead with my eyes in the hope that he would say no.
“No, thank you, my dear.” He says as he stands from the table.
I help him put on his coat and grab his umbrella. He hands me a ten-pound note and walks out the door without a word. I put the money in the till and turn off the lights in the diner.
Afterwards, I head towards the back of the diner where the kitchen is, and realize it's only me and Terry left. He's looking at the schedule hanging up on the office wall with a look of dread on his face. Terry sighs loudly when he looks at the dates he's working. Terry's worked at the diner for over thirty years and not once has he had a day off. His hair is starting to gray, but he can cook the most delicious food I've ever had the pleasure of tasting.
“Hey Terry, the last customer just left. Do you want me to lock up the diner for you?”
Terry waves at me but doesn't look away from the schedule, “I'll lock up the front but could you do me a favor before you leave, dear?”
Before I could respond to say anything, Terry gathers six plastic bags full of trash, and drops them at my feet.
“You want me to take these out to the dumpster?” I ask as I gather all six bags, three in each hand, and look up at Terry.
“Please, I would really appreciate it.” He grabs his jacket, waves, and leaves.
I stare at the swinging door dumbfounded and shake my head.
With the bags still in my hands, I leave through the back and walk towards the dumpster. I scoff when I see that it's pouring down with rain.
Great. Thanks, Terry. Thanks a bunch.
I push open the top of the dumpster, and grab the first two bags to throw in when from the darkness behind me, I hear the faint unmistakable sound of growling. I freeze, wondering if that was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Terrified, I clutch the bags close and turn around, holding the bags as one would a sword, ready to strike out. I turn, and as I open my eyes, I see the source of the growling, as standing not two meters away is the largest wolf I've ever seen.
I whimper in fright, and slowly start to retreat backwards, dropping my makeshift weapon as I go. I feel my back touch the dumpster, and realize there's nowhere for me to go. Shaking in fear, I close my eyes, praying the wolf doesn't see me as a threat or worse, a meal.
“Please don't hurt me.” I whisper repeatedly to myself. I open my eyes and wish that I hadn't.
Its eyes will haunt me for as long as I live. The eyes were blood-red, filled with pure hatred towards me. A dull shade of gray covers its whole body with big chunks of its fur missing, like it had been ripped off. The wolf looked as though it had scars everywhere on its body. How had it managed to survive this long?
I do the only thing I can think of. I kneel down on the wet floor with my head bowed down in the hope it's a sign of submission. The wolf howls into the night and lunges for me. I scream as it tackles me but soon runs into the bushes and out of sight. I look in the direction the wolf ran and start laughing hysterically.
What the fuck	?
I shake my head and pick myself off the floor, my uniform completely ruined. I check myself over, and that's when I notice on my right shoulder that my clothing's been torn apart.
Why does my shoulder hurt so much?
It looked as though something had taken a chunk out of my shirt.
“Ouch!” I wince, and as I touch my shoulder, I see red liquid coating the skin on my hand.
Blood! Did it bite me!?
I look around, trying to figure out whether that really happened.
Shaken, I chuck the last few bags in the dumpster, grab my bag, lock up and head home.
As I walk home in the dark, the rain no longer pouring, I look up into the night sky, and notice the full moon.
Chapter 2

When I arrive at school the next morning, all I can think about is last night. I woke up early to check if it actually happened, and knew that it did when I saw the bite marks. As a result, I couldn't sleep. At all. Sleeping on my right side hurt too much, and school was by far the last place I wanted to be.
I walk to my locker, grab my English book, and that's when I hear my best friend calling my name from the other end of the corridor.
“Alice! Did you watch Game of Thrones last night!?” One thing about Sam is that she doesn't give a damn about what anyone thinks of her. Me? I worry way too much about what people think.
When Sam reaches my locker, she places her hands on her hips and tilts her head for an answer I have yet to give. “So, did you watch it?”
I shake my head, “No... I missed it.”
“You what!? How did you miss it!? You do realize it was the finale right!”' She shrieks hysterically at me.
“Sam.” I use my hand to signal her to lower her voice. “Everyone's staring.”
“You think I care about what people think?”
She didn't give me a chance to answer. Instead, she turns around and faces all the onlookers. “Didn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to stare? My mum always tells me to never stare at anybody because if you do, some people might not be as nice as I'm going to be.”
She turns around and shrugs at me when she sees the pure shock on my face. “I told you, I don't give a damn about what people think.”
I look inside my bag to see if I have everything only to realize that I don't have my pencil case. I reopen my locker when I hear Sam sigh.
“People still staring?”
“What? Oh, no just Ryder and his crew. They walk around here like they own the place, but seriously how does a guy even look that good?”
After I grab my pencil case, I shut my locker and look at my best friend, whose mouth is wide open.
“Sam! You're staring honey, and drooling.” I close her mouth, shove the pencil case in my bag and stare at them. Every single person moves to the side to make room for them to pass. You see, this gang does practically own the school, and if you hurt one of them, you hurt them all.
Everyone knows who they are and no one dares to try and talk to them or to even approach them. They walk side by side in a perfect line. Bane and Silver on the outside, with Kellan and Ryder in the middle.
Bane looks to be the most frightening one out of them all. He has an oval shaped face with small, blue piercing eyes. His mouth, full and firm with a constant sneer on his face. He has tanned skin with a warm, golden brown tint that accentuates his large muscular frame. His hair was thick, black and slicked down with both sides of his head shaved. Bane also had a black bushy beard decorating his face. It was hard sometimes to take him seriously with the beard because it kind of makes him look like a big old teddy bear, but if the rumors were true, you definitely shouldn't say that to his face, not unless you wanted to end up in A&E. He wears a plain white wife-beater that's low enough to show the hairs on his chest, and a long black necklace rests on his chest that looks like a triskelion. He wears black tight jeans with black ankle boots with a small heel.
I look over at Silver who walks on the far right corner and just blatantly stare at her. Every girl wants to be her, and every guy in this school wants to date her, but everyone knows that she's in love with Ryder. The way she looks and smiles at him with her perfect teeth and her perfect body. She has a heart-shaped face with pale, smooth skin and bright blue eyes. Her mouth is full and perfectly shaped which helps accentuates her pouty lips. Her long wild, black untamed hair rests on her left shoulder and hangs down by her waist. Her build small but muscular.
Rumours say that she kicked a jocks ass once after he slapped her ass. He left in an ambulance, and didn't return to school until the next month. No one ever touched her again. Not after that. She wears a black leather jacket that cuts to her waist, plain black shorts, and black thigh high boots.
The kindest looking one out of them all is Kellan. It seems kinda odd to see him with these people. He has an oval shaped face with creamy fair skin, dark brown eyes that look haunted but yet gentle at the same time. His face holds no expression which makes it hard to determine whether he's happy or sad. Curly brown hair frames his perfectly shaped face. He wears a black stretcher in his left ear with both of his arms covered in colourful art. His body slim with no ounce of body fat, just pure muscle. He wears a plain black wife - beater, tight black jeans and black sneakers. Kellan just might be the only approachable one out of them all. He has this kind aura about him that draws people in, and it makes it impossible to dislike him. I remember when he and his girlfriend were together. Anna was one of the sweetest girls in this school, and every single person here respected her and treated her with the utmost kindness, but Kellan lost the love of his life over a year ago. Her body was found by the river near the creek in the early hours of the morning.
People say that the crime scene was like something out of a horror film. Nevertheless, Kellan lost a part of himself after losing Anna, and I didn't blame him.
“What makes her so special? I bet she has like a magic vagina or something plus, she's probably slept with all three of them.”
I look away from Kellan just as he passes by us, and gasp at my best friend. “Sam, stop staring before she beats you up as well as you ending up in the hospital!”
“What? It's not like she can hear me.”
I grab Sam's hand and drag her down the corridor towards our English class. We take our seats near the front row, take out the reading book and wait for Mr Daniels. “Honestly, I guarantee you that she's sleeping with one of them.” Sam points with the tip of her pen to the back of the class without looking back. I look over my shoulder towards the back and see the four of them sitting together, but neither of them speak to each other. Silver sits beside Ryder as always. She always remains by his side.
I look over at Ryder, his expression remaining impassive as Silver strokes his arm compassionately. Anyone could tell just by looking at her that she's in awe of him. Kellan on the other hand, remains silent and sits with his elbows on the table, his head resting between them. Bane sits with his legs crossed on top of the table with his hands resting behind his head. He looks around the room like he's observing everything around him. Only then did it hit me. “Sam!” I hit her hand as I'm turning around and accidentally knock the pen out of her hand.
“That's my favourite pen.” She points down towards the floor. “It never hurt anybody.”
“Are they even supposed to be in this class? Why am I only realizing this now?” I motion towards the back and tilt my head to the back of the room.
“It's the middle of senior year so...no. The school doesn't let people change course in the middle of the year but I don't know. Maybe they worked something out with Mr Daniels?”
She picks up her pen and inspects the damage “You owe me a new pen by the way. This fountain pen was a gift I got on my birthday.”
“Yeah, sure.” I look towards the back of the class again, only to realize that they're all staring back at me. They really were intimidating.
Silver tilts her head to the side and stares at me with a hateful glare, while Bane's jaw ticks.
I knit my brows and look towards Kellan. He smiles a small smile, his eyes crinkle at the sides when I smile back at him. He only smiles for a second, then looks down at his desk again. I move my head completely to face Ryder, and for the first time in years, I really take a good look at him.
He has a chiselled shaped face with tanned spotless skin. Emerald green eyes that keep you staring, but his eyes hold no threat nor hatred, just a pure curious stare. I look at him as he stares back at me to see him smirking. His lips are full, yet firm.
I bet he's kissed a lot of girls with those lips...
After adjusting his beanie, he slicks his shiny black hair to the side and sticks his tongue out at me. I knit my brows in confusion again, and turn around, “Asshole.”
As I face the front of the class all I hear is Ryder laughing from the back.
Shit! Can he lip-read!?
“Who's the asshole?” Sam looks around the room to find the culprit but only finds me staring at her.
She points to herself in panic. “If this is about the pen don't worry about it.”
“No it's nothing. I'm just not up for work tonight.” I pick up the book and skim over the blurb.
“Behind on homework? I can help you at the diner tonight if you want?'
“Thanks, but I'm sure I'll be able to catch up on time.”
I pull out a pen from my pencil case just as the door to the classroom opens.
Is Mr. Daniels off sick today?
“Good morning students, my name is Mr Edmund, and I will be your English teacher for the rest of the school semester. I believe you are reading the novel Wuthering Heights. Can anyone volunteer to start us off?”
He writes his name on the whiteboard as Oliver Edmund. “Where's Mr. Daniels?”
“I'm not obliged to share that information with you, Ms. Frey.”
He turns around, and stares at Sam with his cold demeanour.
“Sir? We were promised to have our test results back today.”
This practice test was everything I needed to pass for next weeks exam. If I'm going to fail another class, I'm not sure I'm going to survive the rest of senior year.
“Alice, isn't it?”
He walks down the aisle holding the clipboard that holds everyone's name, and tilts his head to the side.
“That is correct, yes.” I say with a calm, and collected voice.
“Always raise your hand if you have a question.”
He does a once over on me, then walks to the front of the class, and points to the board.
“I'm your teacher now. Whatever Mr Daniels taught you before, forget about it because he's not coming back.”
He claps his hands together and looks at me. “Now Alice, why don't you start reading for us. Chapter 8, I presume?” He sits down in the chair, and motions with his hand for me start reading.
Where are you, Mr. Daniels?
Chapter 3

At six o'clock, I work my way towards the back of the diner to the office, where Robbie sits behind his desk on the phone.
“Yes, love. Of course, I'll make sure to buy the right one this time, alright love you too. Bye.”
He looks at me with his toothless grin. “Alice, how are you?”
“I'm good, thank you, but I just wanted to ask you if there's an extra uniform here somewhere?”
“What happened to the uniform you have?”
He stands from the old wooden chair, and looks in the cardboard boxes that are placed at the back of the office.
“I spilt some coffee on the shirt, and the stain won't come off.”
I can't lie for shit, but he seems to be buying it.
He sits back down just as he hands me a new uniform, “Be careful this time, alright? I mean, I know you like your coffee, but if it happens again, I'm going to have to ask you to pay for it.”
I take the uniform from him, “Thank you, Robbie, and this time I promise to be more careful.”
I walk rapidly towards the bathroom, lock the door and look at myself in the mirror. I had a heart-shaped face with rosy coloured cheekbones. My never-ending white blonde hair is always kept in a braid down my back. Ivory skin with bright pale blue eyes; like the clear sky. My mother tells me that my eyes are like the colour of diamonds, eyes that are so pale they could appear as white. My teeth are perfectly straight and white after years of my mother lecturing me about how to look after them. My nose is a little on the prominent side, but you can blame my father for that. Thankfully, that's the only thing I have of him.
I've never known my father, nor will I ever want to know him.
After a few moments I sigh, close my eyes and rest my hands on either side of the sink.
Just get it over and done with!
I open my eyes and take off my shirt swiftly, and look over my shoulder to look at the bite.
“What the hell...?”
I look in the mirror to see nothing but pure smooth skin, “Where is it...?”
Not a single bite mark was to be seen.
I didn't understand. It happened just hours ago and yet it's gone?
After changing into my uniform, I walk out of the bathroom and place myself behind the counter, but I couldn't concentrate on doing anything. Questions kept interrupting my thoughts, but I couldn't answer either of them. Maybe it healed overnight?
I peel my shirt over my right shoulder and check again. Nothing.
“Christ, Alice, you trying to give these people a strip tease or something?”
I roll my eyes when I hear her voice. I look towards the front of the diner to see Sam walking towards me with her school bag draped over her shoulder. She takes out her laptop and today's homework, and sits directly in front of me on our new red diner stools.
“I'll have a strawberry milkshake and a few fries please.” She types away on her laptop as I prepare the milkshake.
I walk to the kitchen to see Terry preparing the food for the waiting customers.
“Another order of fries on its own but it's Sam, so take your time, okay”' I do a thumbs up but he doesn't see it, or he's probably ignoring it.
As I walk back into the diner, I realize it's not as busy as I thought it would be.
“Alice, the milkshake's kinda overflowing.” Sam says nonchalantly.
“Shit!”
I rush to the milkshake machine, clean up the mess and pass it over the counter.
“Thank you kindly.” Sam takes a sip of the milkshake, sighs in delight and puts away the laptop.
“So, what do you think of our new English teacher? Hot right?” She winks at me. “I mean, I would.”
“Sam! He's like forty years old!” I hit her with the dishcloth that I keep on my shoulder.
“Age is just a number!”
All the patrons in the diner stop talking, turn in their chairs and stare at the two of us as we laugh over Sam's infatuation with our new teacher. I apologize immediately to them for our adolescent behaviour.
“Sam seriously, he's old enough to be your father.” I clean the counter to look busy when the diner door opens.
Almost immediately, I notice everything falling silent.
I glance over to see why the place has gone quiet, only to see four tall frames at the diner's entrance.Why were they here? They looked so out of place.
Bane walks with confidence towards the closest patron, leaving the other three standing guard at the door. He leans down to one of the regulars and speaks to him. I didn't know how I could hear him, but I heard every single word.
“You might wanna stop staring at us before I tear you apart piece by piece big man.”
“Hey!” I rush from behind the counter, stand directly in front of him only to be met with a broad chest.
“I don't care who you are, but I won't have you talking to the regulars like that.”
At this point, Ryder stands by Bane's side, never taking his eyes away from me.
“Are you saying we aren't welcome here because we're not regulars?” Bane looks at me with pure disgust written on his face.
“Of course, you're welcome here, but if you're going to disrespect the regulars then I'm going to have to ask you to leave.”
I say this with as much confidence as I can muster, but with Ryder standing with his eyes on me the whole time, I'm really quite surprised I haven't shat myself.
“We aren't here to start trouble. We just came to have some food in this highly recommended diner that you have here.” Ryder's voice fills the whole diner. While he speaks, I can't help but stand there looking into his bright green eyes.
“Well, as long as you don't start trouble, take a seat, and I'll grab you some menus.” I say.
Neither of us takes our eyes away from each other, but the connection is broken too quickly when I hear Sam's voice calling me.
“Alice! Where the hell are my goddamn fries!?”
I turn around to see Sam giving me the grumpiest look ever known to mankind.
Without looking at Ryder, I excuse myself and walk behind the counter, my hands shake as I grab four menus and four pairs of cutlery. I glance up again to see Ryder sitting in one of the booths with his friends, but his eyes remain on me.
“I'm known for being a patient person, but please give me my fries!”
“I told Terry to take his time, so whenever Terry's ready to make your fries, he'll make them.”
