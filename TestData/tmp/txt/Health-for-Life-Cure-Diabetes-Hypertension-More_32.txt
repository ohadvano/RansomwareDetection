committee cited the relationship between the current fat rich, fiber deficient American diet,

and the high risk of cancer as wel as heart ailments and other diseases.



Water - One should drink a minimum of two quarts of distil ed water daily. If you are

overweight or doing hard physical work then you need more than 2 quarts. When we do

not drink enough water our body wil absorb water from the fecal matter that is in our

colon. This in turn makes the fecal matter hard, which causes constipation. Our bodies

use much more water than we realize. Each day we lose one and one half glasses of

water, through breathing alone. Over a quart a day is lost in urine; and every time we blink

our eyes, our body loses some water. Of course, our body loses large amounts of water

through perspiration.

Exercise - Exercise wil help one to have regular eliminations. You have six

hundred thirty three muscles, every one of which needs to be used. If we do not use our

muscles, they lose their tone, strength and flexibility. Exercise doesn't have to be painful.

There are hundreds of ways to exercise the human body. The exercise having the most

benefit is walking and no special equipment is required, except a good pair of shoes.

Stress - Do you remember a time when you were enjoying a good meal with

friends and you received a phone cal giving you terrible news? You suddenly lost your

appetite and you even felt light headed and sick. The relation that exists between the

mind, and the body is very intimate. When one is affected the other sympathizes. Stress

today is one of the causes of poor digestion, ulcers and constipation. Grief, anxiety,

discontent, remorse, guilt, distrust, or other emotions, al tend to break down the life

forces. Isaiah 26:3 gives us the answer to this problem.

Medications - Medications can cause many problems with the bowel. The side

effects of many medications cause constipation for many physiological reasons.

Antibiotics, such as penicil in and sulfa can completely eliminate the favorable intestinal

flora, leaving the opportunity for reinfestation by harmful bacteria and viruses.

Laxatives - Laxatives are irritating to the bowel and are dangerous. Today there

are more than 45,000 laxative and cathartic medications being manufactured and used in

America. These substances, in order to evacuate the colon, are essential y poisons and

irritants. The poisoned intestinal tract tries to evacuate the offending substance as quickly

as possible and pushes everything out. Often times, these harsh poisonous substances

are absorbed through the lymph and blood vessels and find their way to al parts of the

body affecting the liver, kidneys, and other vital areas. Many of these medications can

become addicting, and can destroy the ability of the bowel to eliminate natural y.



HERBS

Herbs can be used successful y and safely for constipation. One of the best herbs

for constipation is Cascara Sagrada. Mix four teaspoonfuls in a quart of distil ed water

(that was boiling and just taken off the stove). Let it steep for one hour, then drink one or

two cupfuls one hour before meals or on an empty stomach.

To get wel and stay wel , our bodies have to be clean on the inside as wel as the

outside. If you wil eat natural unrefined foods, drink plenty of pure water, gets proper

exercise, stay away from medications, and al ow God to handle the stress in your life, you

should not have any problems with proper elimination.

FASTING



Fasting is the oldest therapeutic method known to man. Even before the advent of

the healing arts, man instinctively stopped eating when feeling il and abstained from food

until his health was restored. Perhaps he learned this from animals, which always fast

when not feeling wel

There is much said throughout the entire Bible about fasting. God instituted fasting

for both spiritual and physical blessings. Fasting has two purposes - the up building of the

body and the spiritual up building of the soul. As fasting improves physical health, it also

improves mental health causing the mind to be open to a greater extent to the leading and

impressions of the Holy Spirit.

I am thoroughly convinced that a great many people eat too much (over 60% of al

Americans are overweight). Many eat food that does not give them proper nourishment;

they eat food that is highly refined and unwholesome. This food wil gradual y, over a

period of time, bring upon them sickness and death.

Many scientific studies are now being made around the world, particularly in Europe, to

determine the therapeutic effects of fasting. The Karalinska Institute in Stockholm, a world

famous medical research institution, has made clinical studies of fasting under Drs. P.

Reizenstein and J. Kel berg. These studies demonstrated that fasting has a definite

beneficial healing effect.



WATER FAST VS. JUICE FAST VS. FRUIT & VEGETABLE FAST

There are persons who advocate long fasts for health, but I discourage long water

fasts as they can be quite harmful to the body. However, a prolonged fresh fruit and

vegetable fast I highly recommend. Proper fasting can do a lot in helping with one's health;

but improper fasting can be harmful to one's health. A normal person can fast one to three

days on only distil ed water without any injury and it wil be quite beneficial both spiritual y

and physical y to one's health. If you fast on water only for more than three days, then you

are living on the broken down tissues in your body which produces an acid reaction. This

thickens the blood; and with a high concentration of poisons in the bloodstream, puts a

burden on the heart, arteries, kidneys, liver, lungs, etc.

We can help this cleansing process by eating lots of fresh raw vegetables and fruits

as most are alkaline forming and wil increase the healing effect of fasting as elimination of

uric acid and other inorganic acids wil be accelerated. The vitamins, minerals, enzymes

and trace elements of raw vegetables and fruits are important in supplying needed

elements for the body's own healing.

Fasting in Europe is practiced on a grand scale. There are hundreds of clinics in

Germany alone where fasting is a number one method of healing. Al of them use juice

fasting exclusively. I believe that juice fasting is preferable to water fasting, but that the

whole fruit or vegetable fast is preferable to a juice fast. Which is more natural, the orange

or orange juice? He would have put a lid on top of the orange. When you use juice

instead of the whole food, while you are fasting, you wil have problems with elimination as

there is no fiber or bulk in juice.

FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLESS: FAST CLEANSES THE BODY

It is wel to know the process your body goes through in the course of a fast. The

first three days are usual y the most difficult in terms of hunger pains. By the fourth day the

hunger pains are beginning to subside, though you wil have feelings of weakness and

occasional dizziness. During a prolonged fast (after the first three days) your body wil live

on its own substance. When it is deprived of needed nutrition such as proteins and fats, it

wil burn and digest its own tissues. But your body wil not do it indiscriminately -and here

lies the secret of the effectiveness of fasting -your body wil first decompose and burn

those cel s and tissues which are diseased, damaged, aged, or dead.



In fasting, your body feeds itself on the most impure and inferior materials such as

tumors, abscesses, fat deposits, etc. Dr. Otto Buchanan, M.D. (one of the greatest fasting

authorities in the world) cal s fasting -very pertinently - a "refuse disposal", a "burning of

rubbish". During fasting, while the old cel s and diseased tissues are decomposed and

burned, the building of new healthy cel s is speeded up. This eliminative process is

evidenced by some of the fol owing typical symptoms: offensive breath, dark urine, skin

eruptions, excessive perspiration, catarrhal eliminations of mucus, and headaches. Do not

be disturbed by those symptoms; rather, be grateful for the increased health and wel -

being that wil result.

By the ninth or tenth day of a longer fast, the body wil normal y have eliminated the

bulk of toxic poisons and you wil start feeling great. Your sense of concentration wil be

greater, and you wil feel as if you could continue fasting indefinitely as you are not

hungry. Your fast can last as long as you like (it could go on for weeks as it depends upon

how much fresh fruit and vegetables you are eating), but it must end when your hunger

pains return. This is the signal that the body has used up al its excess reserves. The fast

should be broken at this time.





ADDITIONAL TIPS ON FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLE FAST

Do not drink with meals, and do not mix fruits and vegetables at the same meal. Eat

only fresh fruits and vegetables, nothing cooked or dried. Eat no more than twice a day at

a regular time each day, and nothing between meals, except water or herb tea. One must

drink a minimum of two quarts of distil ed water daily; more is better. Bathing once or twice

daily is also beneficial, as one third of al body impurities and wastes are eliminated

through the skin. Do lots of deep breathing of outside air. Red clover tea is a very good

herb to take while one is on a fast. It is an excel ent blood purifier and wil help your body

detoxify. Drink it as often as you like.
