OLIVE OIL





Many health enthusiasts advocate the use of olive oil in the diet, and claim that it is

not harmful to the body as other fats. Olive oil is great for the outside of the body, but not

for the inside, as it is no different from any other refined oil. It is 100% fat. You wil never

find a more natural lotion than COLD PRESSED OLIVE OIL or FRESH ALOE VERA. It

wil do wonders for your skin. I have found that it helps with sore muscles, inflamed joints,

arthritis, etc.

Regular olive oil wil not work; it must be cold pressed. Heating destroys the oil.

Most manufacturers use the cheapest and quickest way possible of processing the oil.

The method most commonly used includes crushing the olive, mixing it with water, then

heating it at 230 degrees F for 30 minutes. Fol owing this, the crushed olives are run

through a press that exerts ten to twenty tons of pressure per square inch. The result of

this great pressure is the exposure of the oil to a great amount of heat and the destruction

of the natural elements found in the oil of the olive.

The natural oil that is found in the olive has to be extracted mechanical y without

heat to produce cold pressed olive oil. If you are not sure that the olive oil you purchased

is cold pressed, there is a simple way to find out. Put your bottle of olive oil in the

refrigerator (not freezer) and let it sit overnight. If it turns cloudy it is cold pressed. When

you rub cold pressed olive oil on your skin, within a half hour it wil be absorbed into your

body and your skin wil not feel sticky or greasy. If you rub regular olive oil on your skin, it

wil stil be there half an hour later. The heating process destroys the natural health

producing properties of the olive oil.

While I am on the subject of oils, I want to share with you information on linseed oil,

and cod liver oil. Linseed oil comes from the flax seed, which is a weed, not a grain. Some

bakeries put ground flax seed in bread or cereals. Those who do this do not know food

chemistry and its relationship to body chemistry. Flax contains cyanide. The leaves and

seed chaff contain the cyaniogenetic clycoside, linamarin. An enzyme (linamarase) is

present in the plant material which is capable of releasing cyanide from linamarin. Cases

of poisoning after ingestion of linseed cake, meal, or flax seed chaff have been reported in

al classes of livestock. Symptoms and lesions are those of cyanide poisoning(1).

What about cod liver oil? Leave it alone! It is from an animal source, and, for that

reason, is of more harm than benefit. I believe God wants us to use only those things that

wil promote good health. Today we should benefit greatly if we were to use on our skin

cold pressed olive oil instead of al the man-made greasy chemical creations.

OSTEOPOROSIS





What is osteoporosis? How do we get it? Can we prevent it through natural means?

Are there natural ways to treat and reverse it? Do we need to fear it? Is more calcium the

answer?

Our bodies are made up of a number of elements. The two most prevalent minerals

in bones are calcium and phosphorus. When calcium is lost from the bones over a period

of time, the bones become porous and brittle and can easily break. This is osteoporosis, a

loss of weight and density in the bone cel s, and the development of a spongy rather than

solid texture of the bones.

The disease actual y consists of two aspects, the loss of bone material resulting in

an enlargement of the spaces in bones. With less material, the appearance of the bones

becomes porous. What looked solid like rock now appears as a sponge.



IS MORE CALCIUM THE SOLUTION?

Very often we have been told that increasing the intake of high-calcium sources,

such as dairy products, wil both prevent and reverse osteoporosis. Is this true?

Two investigators, doing independent research, suggested at the meeting of the

American Society for Bone and Mineral Research in 1986 that dietary calcium bears no

relationship to the development of osteoporosis(1).



Michael Parfitt, osteoporosis researcher at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan,

observes that the 1984 National Institutes of Health (NIH) panel report, recommending the

use of calcium to prevent osteoporosis, is based on weak evidence(2).

B. Lawrence Riggs, Mayo Clinic researcher, reported a study of 107 Rochester,

Minnesota women, 23 to 88 years old. Dr. Riggs fol owed them for 4.3 years, with

repeated measurement of their bone density. Calcium consumption in the study group

ranged from 269 to 2000 mil igrams daily, but the researchers could demonstrate no

relationship between bone loss and calcium intake, even on the lowest calcium intake(3).

Dr. C. Christiansen from Gosstrup Hospital in Denmark reported a two-year study in

which 43 women were placed on calcium supplements, placebos, or estrogen. Calcium

was ineffective in preventing bone loss(4).

Dr. Mazees states that in population studies adjusted for body size and ethnic

origin, individuals with high calcium intakes did not have denser bones than those on low

calcium intakes(5).

Dr. Richard Mazeses of the University of Wisconsin cal s calcium "the laetril of

osteoporosis11, and points out that there are no studies evaluating the safety or efficacy

of calcium supplements. It is known that high calcium intakes can interfere with vitamin D

utilization (also necessary for bone cel formation), and may cause kidney stones (6) .

Approximately 20 mil ion people in the United States are affected by osteoporosis.

Most of them do not understand why they are suffering with this disease. Many of these

people are taking calcium supplements, and believe that this should relieve their

problems. Calcium supplement sales were estimated to have reached 166 mil ion dol ars

in 1986(7).

Tragical y, most of these people should not be using this extra calcium, for excess

calcium in the body has several adverse side effects. It has been shown that excessive

calcium is picked up by the blood and deposited in the soft tissues, the blood vessels,

skin, eyes, joints, and internal organs. Little wonder we suffer.

In the blood vessels, calcium combines with fats and cholesterol to cause

hardening of the arteries. In the skin, excessive calcium causes wrinkling. In the joints it

crystal izes and forms very painful arthritic deposits. In the eyes, it solidifies into cataracts.

And in the kidneys, it forms hard deposits known as kidney stones. Thus it becomes

evident that taking extra calcium does much harm, rather than benefit to the body.



WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF OSTEOPOROSIS?

The major cause of osteoporosis is eating too much protein, especial y in

combination with fat, such as is found in meat and animal products. Most Americans, as

they enjoy their steaks and hamburgers, are eating far too much protein At present, the

World Health Organization suggests a minimum daily protein requirement of about 40

grams. The RDA recommendation is about 55 grams a day. But the average American is

getting over 100 grams a day.

What happens to al this excess protein? First it is broken down into amino acids,

some of which are metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys as urea.

Along with the urea and amino acids excreted into the urine go large amounts of minerals.

One of the minerals lost is calcium; and studies show that the more protein you use, the

more calcium you lose.

The many studies performed during the past fifty-five years consistently show that if

we want to create a positive calcium balance that wil keep our bones solid, then the most

important dietary change that we can make is to decrease the amount of protein we eat

each day.

Some other causes of osteoporosis are smoking, drinking alcohol, coffee, soft

drinks, eating too much salt, taking antacid, insufficient exercise, and lack of sunshine.

Smoking is an exceedingly acid-producing habit; and one of the major roles of calcium in

the body is to maintain a proper acid-alkaline balance. When one smokes, the calcium is

actual y drained from the bones and teeth to meet this need. Alcohol impairs calcium

absorption by affecting the liver's ability to activate vitamin D, which is important in the

metabolism of calcium.

Caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, soft drinks, hot chocolate, and many over-

the-counter drugs, causes more calcium to be excreted from the body than is normal(8).

The more salt (in particular, the more sodium) you take in, the more calcium you excrete.

Some antacids contain aluminum, which causes an increase in calcium excretion. It has

been clearly shown that exercise increases bone mass, while lack of exercise causes

bone loss. Since Vitamin D plays an important role in bone metabolism and the best

source of vitamin D is sunshine, it stands to reason that a lack of sunshine can lead to

osteoporosis.

When the problem of osteoporosis is studied world-wide, one is struck with the fact

that the highest incidence of osteoporosis is in countries where dairy products and calcium

supplements are consumed in the greatest quantities. The incidence of osteoporosis is

lowest in the countries where the least amount of dairy products are consumed, such as

the African countries. A number of studies have been done among the Bantu women of

Africa. They consume less than half the protein of Americans, and have a life-style

demanding large amounts of calcium (nursing up to ten children in a lifetime), yet

osteoporosis is almost unknown among them.
