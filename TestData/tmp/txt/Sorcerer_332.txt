The spider rose, tendons and chitinous body parts rubbing together like sandpaper. At three meters, she towered over them.
“Human, how many spells do you know?” said the spider.
“Four,” said Kiran. He and Gatril looked at each other with uncertainty. 
“Why would a spider be interested in spells?” said Gatril.
“Isn’t it obvious by what your eyes see?” said the arachnid. “I’ve become enlightened. I no longer thrive on my instincts except to feed to maintain my health.”
“Is that why you haven’t laid any eggs?” said Gatril.
“Yes,” she replied. “I’ve recently stopped accepting offers from the males. They are lowly beasts. Not bright in the head. I’ve sharpened my mind, nourishing it with the knowledge of humans.”  She showed them her hand, conjuring within it a ghostly white energy that danced like a swirling mist.
“That’s…spirit energy,” Kiran said.
The spider closed her hand and the energy vanished. “I’ve grown fond of this power that some humans possess, to point where I managed to discover it in myself. Kiran, if you can teach me about magic, I can give you the queex you want.”
“What?” Gatril turned to Kiran, expecting to see him speechless just like her, but the boy smiling much to her dismay.
“Wow!” said Kiran. “That sounds like a fair trade.”
Gatril grabbed Kiran by the shoulders and quickly walked him back to the mouth of the room. “What are you doing?” Gatril whispered.
“What’s wrong?” said Kiran.
Gatril pinched his lips. She looked over her shoulder at the spider’s six eyes visually ravaging her. Gatril flinched and turn to Kiran. “You can’t teach her magic. You’ve seen what she did to those bodies. Imagine if she starts walking around with a bunch of spells.”
Kiran’s train of thought came an abrupt stop, reversing to take another route that brought him upon a different outcome. “Oh, no,” he said.
“I can hear you, you know,” said the spider.
Kiran and Gatril spun around with innocent smiles. “Umm, you might have misheard,” said Kiran. “We were just talking about how pretty your vagina looks?”
The spider flexed her arms. “You don’t have much of a choice,” she said. “Either teach me about magic and get my queex, or I trap you here until you change your mind. One scream, and all the males will come running in at my side.”
“Then we’ll just have to make this quick,” said Kiran, raising his staff.
The spider flicked her tail and unleashed her webs in an arc. Gatril and Kiran dove out of the way of the silky strands.
Kiran used his force-counter spell, but the j’bafofi leapt into the ceiling. She uttered a high pitched clicking sound that froze Kiran and Gatril.
“Shit!” Gatril said. She opened fire at the spider but the J’bafofi was too fast; scurrying over the surface of the room, spewing more webs that threatened to fill the area. Gatril quickly spat an acidic mist around her that melted the webs, and the j’bafofi seized the opportunity, lunging with a kick that threw Gatril into the wall.
The spider hissed and lunged once more, only to have a column of rock punch her in the stomach. She winced and crumpled, quickly leaping into the ceiling.
Kiran lifted a large rock out of the floor again and launched it with his force-counter. “Got you!” he said.
But the j’bafofi caught the rock and attached it to a thread of silk from her tail. “Thank you,” she sneered.
Kiran felt something heavy drop in his gut when the spider threw the rock at him. Luckily Gatril already got up and dove with Kiran out of the way. The she-spider used the rock and silk like a flail, constantly trying to smashed the human and bosdrake, forcing them all over the room, tripping and kicking over books in their way.
“Kiran!” said Gatril as she ducked beneath the flying rock. “Get me some higher ground!”
“Got it!” said Kiran, tapping the floor and ascended Gatril atop a column. At this height Gatril got a better shot, and managed to put a round in the spider’s shoulder.
The j’bafofi screamed and drop the rock, falling to the floor ground with brute force.
Gatril laughed. “Stay down bitch!”
But unbeknownst to the dragon, a single strand of silk as thick as her pinky had flowed from the spider’s tail and attached to Gatril’s foot. The dragon only found out when the spider yanked her tail and snagged Gatril’s footing from beneath her.
Gatril fell into the j’bafofi’s grasp. The spider held her arms and legs with all of hers. She brought Gatril closer to her impending, salivating fangs. Kiran leaped at the spider with his staff, only to have her tail coil around him.
However, Kiran’s hand with the staff was free, and he looked to the ceiling with epiphany. I hope this works! Kiran thought, and he charged his staff with spirit energy and tossed it into the ceiling.
“I never ate a dragon before,” the spider said with insidious grin behind her fangs.
Gatril bore her teeth in defiance. She tried hawking up some more acid but her stomach’s content had reached its limit. But that proved unnecessary, as Gatril has the pleasure of seeing a huge rock land in the j’bafofi’s head with a solid thonk sound.
