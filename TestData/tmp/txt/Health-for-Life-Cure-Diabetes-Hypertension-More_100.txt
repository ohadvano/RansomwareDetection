TIPS TO HELP

Listed below are some tips I used to help me with the diet changes â€“ and especially the 21-30 day cleansing period.

Drink a Â½ litter (approx 16 oz.) bottle of water about a half hour before a meal. Not only does this help you eat less, it helps you drink the alkaline water you need for the day.

Eat 3 meals and 3 snacks a day. I ate breakfast, lunch and dinner and then forced myself to eat a snack between breakfast and lunch, between lunch and dinner, and before bed.

It was very hard to eat 3 meals and 3 snacks. My meals quickly reduced in size from my previous idea of what a meal â€˜portionâ€™ represented.

Eat dinner 2 to 3 hours before bed.

Eat your last snack before going to bed. It will help keep you satisfied throughout the night and provide energy while you sleep.

Eat snacks that contain a protein, fruit or vegetable and fat. For example, a snack might be an orange and a handful of almonds, or peanut butter on celery with raisins, or peanut butter on banana, or a handful of walnuts with apple slices, etc. In each of these cases the nuts provided my fat and protein.

It is best to eat fruit on an empty stomach because it passes through the stomach quickly and digests in the intestines. If eaten after a meal it may upset the stomach. Thatâ€™s why I always eat fruit for breakfast. It gives me quick energy that gets me through to my first snack without feeling too full.

Eat slowly. Chew food thoroughly. Enjoy it. Digestion begins in the mouth where saliva contains lots of enzymes. You will feel more satisfied and your body will process what you eat more efficiently and you wonâ€™t feel so full at your next snack.

Donâ€™t eat if you are not hungry. I skipped a few meals at the beginning because I just was not hungry

Do not overeat. The stomach digests food the size of about 2 fists the best. If you are too full the stomach digestive juices have trouble properly digesting food efficiently. Youâ€™ll feel full for too long.

Chew gum. It relaxes you and gets saliva flowing to aid in digestion, clean your teeth and flushes away bad breath bacteria.

Use a juicer if you can. They are awesome. I use the left over fiber to bake healthy muffins and cookies for others.

If youâ€™re eating a salad try lemon, lime or fresh orange juice or sprinkle on some no-sodium herb blends for added flavor.

I kept cooking too much vegetable stews, 12 bean soups, etc. So I prepared enough for the family to share and for the next dayâ€™s lunch.

Lightly grill some vegetables for a change up in taste.

I love â€˜baby carrotsâ€™. OK, they are just peeled and cut carrots, but they are good. If you are lucky enough to find some real baby carrots eat them. They contain more nutrients.

Sprouted seeds provide the most energy.

The Kimâ€™s Greens I used at first tasted like grass. So I put them in my fruit-smoothie in the morning. The pH balance greens I tried the 2nd time taste better.

Grilled Portobello mushrooms have a texture much like meat. When I made them with spices for the family or put them in a stew, nobody knew it wasnâ€™t meat. I made one as a steak sandwich for someone and they didnâ€™t know.

Frozen vegetables are a quick meal and have more nutrients than fresh because they donâ€™t lose nutrients to the air on the way to market.

Diabetics should monitor blood glucose levels and reduce insulin shots or oral medications accordingly. Consult your medical provider.

Magic Bullet mixers, George Forman Grills and Juicers, are awesome tools to use on any healthy diet. If you need to purchase any of the items you can buy them online at

Amazon.com, Buy.com and other retailers.
