“Yes,” Gatril said. “Midday to be exact. A lamia will usually climb high out of reach to get warm before slithering back into its burrow.”
“Then we just wait until the sun’s high in the sky before we search then,” Kiran said.
Gatril said, “Right. And in the meantime,” she lifted her skirt, exposing her wet vagina, “let’s have some fun with that mouth of yours.”

After having pleasure Gatril, she and Kiran found themselves a tree to climb and get a wider view of their surroundings. While Kiran looked from pair of binoculars, Gatril used her sharp eyes to scoured the land for any sign of their target.
Apart from the grazing animals and a pack of wild dogs that had marched by, they spotted nothing close to what they were after. Even after it had past twelve in the afternoon, and the sun scorched everything below, the pair didn’t see a hint of a lamia. 
But an hour later, their patience was rewarded.
“I see it…” said Kiran, smiling brightly.
“I see one too,” said Gatril.
In Kiran’s sight he saw the long, dark green body of something slithering across the ground. Then it suddenly reared up on its thick legs and trotted towards a tree. The one Gatril looked at had a color closer to brown, making its way towards a rock. 
“How can we tell the gender?” said Kiran. “I need the queex specifically.”
“Just look at the face,” said Gatril. “But I can also tell by smell. These are both male. Males usually share the same territory, travelling in gangs. Females live by themselves, so we should look elsewhere.”
“Okay,” said Kiran.
They both waited until a few more males came out, scattered around the plain, until they got down and made for the quacycle. They were about to get on their transportation when something sped out of the bushes at them. A massive leopard.
Kiran screamed and fumbled for his gun, but his dragon companion roared and launched herself into the ferocious feline. They growled and snarled as they tousled on the ground in a heap of thrashing limbs and tails, trying to find a mortal opening on the other as Kiran frantically tried to find a chance for himself to take a shot. Finally Gatril’s jaws found the leopard’s neck and she sank her teeth into its flesh.
Blood ran from the wound, and the leopard’s flailing grew less intense. Gatril stood and wiped her mouth. The big cat was dead on the ground. 
“Are you alright?” Kiran said. 
Gatril knelt over the leopard and inspected it. “I’m fine,” she said. She took out her knife and began cutting open the cat. Kiran saw the scratches on her skin, but little blood. Dragon skin was known for being very resistant after all.
“What are you doing?” Kiran said.
“Can’t let meat go to waste,” she said, ripping out the leopard’s heart and liver. These she ate on the spot, and peeled the leopard’s skin off and carve off huge hunks of meat. She wrapped them in the skin and stood. The process itself took only a few minutes. “Let’s leave before more predators come after us.”
They rode away from the carcass and through the plain once more, their eyes and ears warier of the predators. This allowed Gatril to identify a clan of prowling hyenas and instruct Kiran to ride around them. 
Kiran and Gatril came to another tree where they made their second stop. This one was close to a nearby cluster of trees and bushes and a very small watering hole.
They climbed the tree and surveyed the land once more. Their wait wasn’t long, and Gatril saw it. Saw her first. It came out of the brush, slithering across the ground with a slick and shiny grey body with bands of black. Her face had a blunt nose, and thin lips rimming her wide mouth. Her eyes were bright yellow with long lashes, and around her head was stringy brown hair. She leisurely coiled her body atop a rock, resting her head across her folded arms. 
Gatril tapped Kiran for his attention, and gestured to the lamia. Kiran observed the beast through his binocular and grinned excitedly. “Great! I have her!”
Gatril nudged him. “Keep your voice down”
“Sorry,” Kiran said. “So how do we get it from her? I wanted to subdue her with some glue rounds. But maybe that would get her riled up.”
“I’ll try to give her a talk,” Gatril said.
“Really?” replied Kiran.
“Beasts such as ourselves have respect for each other you know,” said Gatril. “If you were to go, she would most likely eat you on the spot. Just give me a moment.”
Gatril climbed down the tree and approached the massive serpent. Kiran watched in the distance as the lamia raised her head at the bosdrake. He saw their mouths moving, but he couldn’t hear their words. At one point Gatril gestured in his direction and the snake turned its head his way. 
Then Gatril turned to the tree and waved at Kiran.
Kiran took a deep breath and relaxed. He climbed down the tree with his gear towards the two reptilians.
Upon nearing the lamia, Kiran could see more of her in detail, and realized that her huge, muscular body could easily crush him to a pulp.
“Here he is,” said Gatril, playfully pushing Kiran to the front. 
The serpent rose its upper body and unfolded her arms, revealing small breasts with pointed nipples. She hovered over Kiran, her pink tongue flashing from her mouth like lightning. She had a smell similar to wet soil, not unpleasant, but pungent, and it got Kiran wondering how her fluids would taste.
