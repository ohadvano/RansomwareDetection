Kellan's voice starts to rise. “So, you think that we did it? If you do then you obviously don't know who we are.”
“Then why would he accuse you three and lie to me?” Kellan shrugs. “You're asking the wrong person.”
I remain silent.
Kellan looks at me sympathetically, turns around and join the others on the court.
Even though a part of me still thinks that Ryder had something to do with Max, Kellan does have a point. Maybe they had nothing to do with Max's injuries but then again, why would he lie to me in the first place?
I'm shaking my head by the time I walk into the cafeteria. I see Sam straight away at the salad bar filling up her plate with lettuce and cucumber. She sees the fury on my face and walks straight to me.
“Why do you look like you're about to kill someone?” “I'll tell you later after I've calmed down a bit.”
“That bad?”
I nod. “Yeah. Would it be alright if I came over to your house tonight? I'm gonna call in sick at work.”
“You know by now that you're always welcome to come over.”
After spending lunch with Sam, we part ways to the last lessons of the day, leaving Sam with Math and French for me.
When the bell chimes for the end of the lesson, students fill the corridors as they leave through the gargantuan doors of the school.
I decide to wait for Sam next to her black Porsche, and when I hear wolf whistles coming from the jocks, I know that Sam's nearby. When I see her approaching she rolls her eyes and shakes her head.
“Every fucking day.”
Sam unlocks the car and we both get in. “You love it really.” I wink.
Sam gives me the middle finger and starts the car.
Chapter 10

“You slapped him!?”
Sam and I sit on her bed eating chocolates while watching Gossip Girl. Before we arrived at her house, I told her everything about Max and what he told me.
“Yeah, and I don't regret it either. Is that bad?”
Sam snorts. “Are you kidding me, he had it coming.”
“I just don't know who to believe.” I pick up a piece of chocolate and shove it in my mouth.
She shrugs. 'I mean, I can see where you're coming from. You've got Ryder who's an Alpha and has his own pack. We don't know what kind of pack they are and what they do or what they're capable of, but they don't really seem that bad. Yes, they might have anger issues but I've never heard or seen them beat up a random person before. As for Max, we have no idea who he is or his history. I mean we just met him yesterday, and he seems like a genuinely nice guy but again we don't really know him.” Sam turns the TV volume down. “We're at an impasse, Alice.”
I lie on my side and sigh. “It just doesn't make sense! Why would Max say that Ryder, Kellan and Bane beat him up? Unless Ryder's a good liar and he's brainwashed his pack to believing that they didn't do it.”
“Look, I think it's been a long day. We need to chill, not mention any boys and just watch Chuck Bass being sexy.”
“That sounds great, but I'm more of a Nate Archibald fan.”
After hours of watching episodes of Gossip Girl and eating piles of chocolate, we decide to turn in for an early night. I leave her room to go down the kitchen for a glass of milk, when I feel my head starting to pound. It's probably caused after the shouting and the stress of today.
I shake it off, grab a glass, open the fridge and grab the milk.
As I pour the milk into the glass my whole body feels like it's going through a heat wave, and everything around me starts to blur.
Oh, no! Please, no!
My legs give out beneath me making the glass in my hand shatter to the floor into a million pieces. I taste a metallic tang in my mouth that tastes a lot like blood. Inside my mouth, I feel an agonising pain in my oral cavity that's unbearable to cope with. I carefully run my tongue along the bottom of my mouth and freeze. I start to feel very sharp canine teeth forming on top of my human teeth. My hearing becomes clearer which allows me to hear my heart racing inside my chest. Shaking with fear, my legs start to numb leaving me no choice but to double over onto the floor on all fours. I can hear Sam running down the stairs shouting my name repeatedly, but I have no strength to answer her. The pain in my stomach becomes so unbearable that it makes it hard for me to breathe properly. My arms start to ache from trying to keep upright off the floor. What I don't expect next is for my hands to start hurting. I squint hard enough to concentrate on my left hand to see what's causing the pain, and realize my nails have elongated into sharp claws. The pain is excruciating.
It's actually happening! I'm turning!
My blurry vision allows me to see a form entering the kitchen. The moment Sam sees me on the floor shaking uncontrollably, she screams so loud that it hurts my eardrums.
She crouches down in front of me. “Alice!?” She places her hand gently on my shoulder. “Please......help...me.”
I place my head on the tile floor to cool myself down.
“What do you want me to do!? Tell me how I can help you.” She cries.
“Get..Ry...Ryder. He can help.” Sam's already reaching for her phone.
I don't know why I asked Sam to call him, but what other choice did I have? Maybe with his guidance, he'll help me survive this change, but one thing is for sure that I can't take any more of this pain.
If this happens every time I change I don't think I'd have the strength to do it.
“It's happening! So, get your wolf ass to my house right now!”
She slams the phone into the receiver and rushes back to me.
“He's on his way, Alice! Everything's gonna be fine.”
After what feels like hours, we both hear the front door slam. “Alice!?|
“She's in here! Hurry!” Sam yells from the floor. She's has not left my side.
Ryder appears in the kitchen doorway wearing nothing but black jeans.
“Couldn't you at least put on a shirt before you came here?”
Sam arches a brow, but Ryder ignores her and crouches down next to me.
He places his hand gently on my forehead and hisses, “She's too hot.”
He shakes his head in dismay.
“What do you suggest we do? Move her?”
“Yup.” He carefully picks me up and carries me out of the kitchen. “Where's the bathroom?”
“Should you be moving her? She doesn't look good at all and she looks really pale.”
“Sam! Where's your bathroom!?” Ryder yells.
“Upstairs, first door on the right.”
Sam follows Ryder every step of the way. “What are you gonna do?”
Ryder rushes up the stairs, into the bathroom and sits me down on the toilet. I can hardly keep myself upright, but Sam moves to hold my hand to steady me.
“We're gonna put her in the bathtub and fill it with cold water.”
He reaches over and turns the cold tap on then turns to me while the water runs. “You're gonna be alright.” He cups my cheeks. “I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.”
I can do nothing but stare at him. I try hard to say anything but stop when I realize that I can't. It's like I'm struggling to form words. Ryder notices and frowns at me.
With his hand, he opens my mouth and wheezes. “Her teeth are starting to break through.”
He turns back to the bathtub and turns the tap off. “Is that a good thing?” Sam urges.
“It's a good thing because it means that the change won't be as complicated.”
Ryder picks me up into a standing position and grabs the hem of my dungarees.
“What do you think you're doing?” Sam snaps as she pushes his hands away from me.
“What does it look like I'm doing? I'm undressing her.”
Ryder unbuckles the straps and removes it leaving me only in a long sleeved shirt and my underwear.
My body feels incredibly weak to argue with him about it.
“I don't think she'd approve of you seeing her in her underwear.”
“I don't think she's in her right mind to decide whether she approves it or not.” He grabs the hem of the shirt and lifts it up to my abdomen. Sam lifts both of my arms above my head.
Sam gasps. “Look! Her fingers!” Claws. Razor-sharp claws.
“I know.” Ryder picks me up gently and puts me into the cold water.
I sigh in delight once my body touches the cool surface.
I grab onto his arm. “How much longer?” I struggle to burst out.
Ryder brushes back my hair. “Not long now.” He rushes out of the bathroom.
Sam sits on the bathtub and smiles at me. “You okay? You scared the hell out of me.”
I close my eyes tightly as the pain in my abdomen starts to burn. “I just want this to end.”
Sam grabs my hand out of the water and holds it tightly. “Me too.”
Ryder comes back into the room with a blanket.
“What happens now?” Sam moves out of the way for Ryder to pick me out of the water.
“I need to lay her down, preferably somewhere that's comfortable.”
Ryder wraps me in the blanket and picks me up again. “She can lie on my bed.”
Sam leads the way into her room with Ryder and me on her heel.
When we reach the bedroom, Ryder puts me down gently and looks me over.
“Is she gonna be okay?”
“Her teeth and claws have formed perfectly but..” Ryder places his hand on my abdomen.
“But what?” Sam sits next to me on the bed.
“Her bones need to break through, and it's not gonna be pretty.”
Ryder holds my hand reassuringly.
Sam crosses her arms over her chest. “Will that be the last thing that happens to her because I can't stand to see her like this?”
“Sam, it needs to happen whether she likes it or not. She was stupid enough to fight the first time. She would have avoided all of this if she would have listened to me.”
Sam jumps off the bed and confronts Ryder. “How dare you speak about her like that! It's not her fault!”
I'm lying on the bed drenched in sweat with my whole body in indescribable pain when I notice that both Sam and Ryder arguing. I struggle to open my mouth to make them stop, but I can't do anything other than listen to them.
How much longer!?
Suddenly my back arches off the bed, and I hear the cracking snap of my bones breaking and reforming throughout my body. I'm screaming at the gut-wrenching pain it's causing inside of me. Sam and Ryder stop arguing when they hear the ear splitting scream that leaves my mouth.
“This is it.” Ryder helps me off the bed and gently puts me on the floor.
“Oh my God, it's happening.” Sam shrieks.
“Sam be quiet.” He cups my cheeks. “You're doing really well.”
“Am I gonna die?” I'm trying to focus on Ryder's face through my blurry haze.
“Absolutely not because you know why, Alice?” “Why?”
The bones in my legs start snapping and it's causing me to grunt in pain.
“Because I won't let you. I know it hurts, but this is the worst part and then it's all over. You'll never have to go through it again.”
I nod as he moves away from me. “We need to give her space.”
He grabs Sam's arm and pulls her towards the doorway.
When they leave me on the floor in complete agony, I feel everything inside me going warm.
The room's silence is interrupted with more intense sounds of my bones breaking, making me have this urge to let go. The bones in my face hurt so much that I can't stop the tears from falling.
Sam struggles in Ryder's hold.
“Let me go to her! She's struggling!” Sam screams.
Ryder grunts as she elbows his chest. “She's doing what needs to be done!”
When I feel the bones start to change the shape of my face, I go to scream but it's not a scream that leaves my mouth.
What does leave my mouth is a loud piercing howl that's probably loud enough to scare the living creatures nearby, and the urge to burst comes almost unexpectedly.
I feel like a bomb is about to go off inside me, and then it happens.
I'm standing on all fours; body perfectly formed into a wolf.
My wolf instinct has taken over my entire body, and I'm left speechless. I'm looking at myself at a distance in Sam's floor length mirror, and all I can do is look at myself.
There are no words.
My body feels so strong and muscular.
Fur as white as snow covers my whole body, sharp white teeth and long pointy ears.
I turn my head to look at Sam and Ryder, to see both of their eyes wide in shock. Neither of them says a word. I walk over on my unsteady legs and approach them. Ryder looks at me straight in the eye and he freezes. For some reason that causes me to start growling directly at him.
“Why is she growling at you?” Sam asks Ryder from the doorway.
“Alice knows me but her wolf doesn't. She thinks I'm a threat to her.”
“And are you?”
“We'll see what he has to say.” I tilt my head when Ryder starts shifting so effortlessly into a wolf.
And by a wolf, I mean an Alpha.
What I see is a large black mass of fur with bright red eyes. I can feel myself shrinking back when I hear him let out a loud and long howl.
His ears are raised and pointed forwards, fangs and teeth are barred.
He's clearly showing me who the Alpha is.
I lower my head in submission hoping he'll realize I'm not challenging him, but the next thing I know I'm lifting my head and growling back at him.
Sam stares at the both of us in bewilderment. “Don't you dare!”
Ryder turns around and growls at Sam causing her to jump in fright. Seeing Sam frightened stirs something inside of me, and straight away I'm lunging straight at Ryder; going right for his face.
He sees it coming straight away and tackles me. Sam starts screaming when she sees me and Ryder fighting vigorously on the floor.
“Stop it! Both of you are gonna hurt yourselves!”
I force Ryder off me and lunge for him again only to be shoved roughly against the mirror. Once my body makes contact with it, the shards of the glass break from the impact.
I lie on the floor for a second only to get back up from the adrenaline and lunge again at Ryder's back. Ryder wraps his teeth around my neck and pulls me off of him and he doesn't let go.
He drags me from my neck past Sam, out of the bedroom and down the stairs. He has such a tight grip on me that it's impossible to get out of it.
The moment we reach Sam's garden, Ryder releases me and backs away. By the time Sam joins us, Ryder has shifted back into his human form, wearing only his trousers, he looks down at me with a frown on his face.
“Turn her back!” Sam snaps.
He turns to her with a snarl. “Don't tell me what to do.” 'Turn her back now!”
Ryder ignores her and crouches down beside me.
I'm too weak to move from my position on the floor, and I think he knows that too.
I lie on the floor and close my eyes, I don't know how but I feel my body suddenly changing, and it does so without any effort. I'm aware that I have no clothes on and that Ryder's sitting next to me, but I no longer care about looking decent for anyone.
“Move!” Sam nudges Ryder out of the way and places a fluffy blanket over me.
I gather the strength to sit up from the floor and wrap the blanket around myself.
I look at Sam to see her eyes welling with tears. “Alice?”
I pause for a minute and laugh. “I'm alive!” Sam starts to laugh too. “I know!”
Sam reaches over and hugs me tightly. I gasp. “Did you see me!?”
“I saw everything, and I couldn't be more proud of you!”
Then I remember the fighting. “Sam! I'm so sorry about your mirror!”
Sam shrugs. 'Don't worry about it. It wasn't even your fault.” Sam looks behind me and sneers.
I turn around and meet Ryder's expressionless face. “You owe me a new mirror!”
Sam marches into the house and slams the door behind her.
Wrapped up in the blanket, I get up from the floor and stand, neither of us move.
After a few minutes of silence, Ryder decides to break the silence.
“You didn't see your eyes, did you?” He frowns. “No.” I answer bluntly.
The mirror was too far for me to see that close. Ryder says nothing.
What did he see?
“Was something wrong with them?” He says nothing and looks away.
I'm starting to get very impatient with him, “Ryder!”
Ryder's head swivels back to look at me. “The colour of your eyes was unexpected.”
“Why? What colour were they?” He pauses for a long time. “Red.”
A pause.
“What?” I whisper.
“Red, your eyes were red.”
What? Surely he's lying...
Ryder clears his throat and frowns. “You're an Alpha.”
Chapter 11

“What!?” I spluttered. “That's impossible!”
I can't believe what I'm hearing, it just doesn't make sense at all. Me? An Alpha? That doesn't seem right.
“I know, but it's what you are.”
“Yeah, but how? You should know about this stuff!”
For someone who's been a wolf all his life, he should know why this has happened.
“I don't know! I'm just as confused as you are.”
None of us says anything for a while, I think we're both in shock.
“And by the way, I'm fine. Thanks for asking.” Ryder looks at me in confusion. “What?”
I place my hands on my hips. “Have you forgotten about the part of you attacking me?”
“Are you being serious? Because if I remember, you're the one who started it.”
I roll my eyes. “Very mature.”
I turn away from him and enter back into the house to see Sam cleaning up the milk and the glass off the floor.
“Sam let me do that.”
Sam puts the broken glass in the trashcan and smiles at me. “It's done. Don't worry about it.” He points outside.
“Has he left?”
“No, unfortunately.” I wrap the blanket tighter around me. Ryder walks into the kitchen. “I can hear you, you know?” He closes the door and leans against it.
Sam walks right up to him, and with her finger, she points the middle of his chest. “You can leave now.”
He ignores her and walks over to me. His eyes caress me.
Men...
“Are you alright at least?” “Like you care?”
I turn away and walk up the stairs, I hear him following me.
“Believe it or not, I actually do care about you. I wouldn't be here if I didn't.”
When I reach Sam's bathroom I ignore Ryder, grab my clothes from the floor and go into Sam's bedroom to change. I see the broken shards of glass all over Sam's carpet and feel a great amount of guilt.
I'll have to buy her a new one.
“My transformation was a success, you're no longer needed.”
With my back to Ryder, I drop the blanket, I hear Ryder suck in a breath behind me.
“Alice, you don't mean that.”
“Actually, I do. And by the way, I still haven't forgotten about what you did.”
I grab the shirt from the floor and pull it over my head.
I feel Ryder's presence coming closer and closer just as he stops right behind me, I hear his breathing against my neck. “I hope you're not talking about who I think you are.”
When he places his hands on my hips, my breathing increases.
“What you did was unforgivable.”
Picturing Max's beaten face and him standing on crutches brings back the anger I had earlier today.
Ryder leans in close to my ear, his mouth slightly touching the top of my ear. “And I told you that I didn't do it.”
His whole body frames mine so perfectly that I lean slightly backwards into his tall frame. He leans forward, wraps his arm around my waist and pulls me tighter to him. I feel his warm, solid chest against my back.
“How do I know if you're telling the truth?” “Then, you'll just have to trust me.”
He rubs his nose behind my ear causing a shiver to run down my back.
I escape his hold. “Enough.”
I turn to face him to see him biting his lip with his eyes fixed on me, I pull my shirt down to cover myself. “What's the matter?” He strides over to me.
There's no way I'm getting close to him like that again. “You don't want me?”
I'm walking backwards having no idea what's behind me. “Don't ever touch me like that again.”
When my back meets Sam's dresser, I quickly place my arm in front of me to stop Ryder from coming any closer.
He grabs my wrist and pulls it towards his chest.
As he walks towards me with my hand still on his chest, I feel my hand descending downwards and before I know it, Ryder's right in front of me.
“What do you think you're doing?” I look down at the floor.
He places a fingertip under my chin and lifts it up. “Doing what I should have done a long time ago”
Ryder reaches down and places his hands behind my legs. “What's that supposed to mean?”
Ryder leans in closer. “You know exactly what it means.”
He lifts me up by my legs and sits me on top of the dresser with my legs wrapped around his waist. My hands stay rooted to the dresser's edge.
“Are you gonna stop me?”
Ryder strokes my thighs while staring into my eyes. I find myself shaking my head.
The moment I shake my head, Ryder's mouth slams onto mine; his lips soft and smooth. His tongue invades my mouth and starts aggressively fighting with mine. One of Ryder's hand holds the back of my neck tightly as he controls the kiss, while his other hand's under my thigh. Sam's makeup and perfume fall off the dresser in our haste to get closer to each other. He pulls my hair and goes down my neck; kissing every part of me he touches. I can only close my eyes and enjoy the moment.
I run my hands through his hair when he suddenly kisses down the valley between my breasts, and I can't help but shiver from the contact. No man has ever kissed that part of me.
Just when I feel his hands on my breasts, I feel another presence coming into the room.
“You have got to be kidding me!?”
Both of our heads swing to the doorway, but neither of us move from the position we are in.
“Do you mind?” Ryder growls at Sam which wakes me out of my trance. What the hell am I doing?
Kissing Ryder was not supposed to happen.
“In fact, I do mind. That's my best friend you were mauling just now.” Sam stands with her hands on her hips.
Ryder strides over to Sam with his fists clenched. “I was not mauling her. Did she look distressed or uncomfortable to you?”
“Ryder, were you not here tonight? She's in a state that makes her vulnerable to doing anything.”
I get off from the dresser and continue getting dressed. “You don't know what the hell you're talking about, Sam.”
Sam scoffs. “Just leave okay? She's had a tough night and she needs a rest.”
My eyes are cast downwards when I hear Ryder approaching me. “Alice?”
He cups my cheeks gently. “Do you want me to leave?” I move out of his hold and look away. “Yes.”
I walk over to the window, giving Ryder my back.
He doesn't move straight away like I thought he would.
A few seconds go by when he walks out the room and down the stairs, I hear the front door slam shut.
“If he's broken the fucking door there's no explaining that to my parents.”
From my position in the window, I see Ryder only in his trousers running down the middle of the road.
One second he's human, the next he's transformed. “Alice?”
My eyes are still glued to where Ryder ran off, “Yeah?”
“You okay? You haven't really spoken since you've changed back.”
Sam comes to a stop behind me.
I turn around and smile at my best friend. “I'm fine.
Thanks to you.”
“If something would have happened to you.” Tears start to well in her eyes.
“Sam, don't be like that.” I place my hands on her shoulders. “Tonight, anything could've happened, but I'm still standing and I'm fine.”
Sam rubs her eyes and smiles. “Do you feel any different?”
I drop my hands and shrug. “I feel no different than before, but I think some parts of me will change eventually. Like my hearing and my ability to smell things more clearly.”
Sam walks to her dresser and sneers, “And your libido.”
My what?
“Excuse me?”
Sam looks surprised at me. “You didn't know that?”
Sam giggles to herself. “If you watched Vampire Diaries, then you'd know that your sexual desire becomes more frequent.”
“Meaning?”
Sam snorts. “Meaning you'll want sex all the time.”
“There's no way that's true Sam and besides it's a TV show, doesn't mean that it's true.”
Sam looks at me with a look of disgust on her face, “Oh, really? So it wasn't you just now trying to eat Ryder's face off?” Sam arches her brow.
Kissing Ryder was a huge mistake and I'm standing in Sam's room trying to come up with a reasonable explanation for why I did what I did, but I come up with nothing other than it was a mistake.
“And don't try to tell me that it meant nothing because trust me, it didn't look like nothing.”
“It just happened and I can't believe I let it happen.”
Sam looks at me with a huge grin. “See? It's your libido.”
I pinch the bridge of my nose and close my eyes, “Okay, that's enough sex talk.”
“I'm just saying that your whole life is about to change, little virgin.” Sam smirks at me.
Being a virgin is really not that big of a deal. I've had boyfriends before but I'd rather give it to someone that I really care about and besides, there's no rush to losing it. I'm only eighteen and in no hurry; unlike Sam who lost her virginity at sixteen.
“I'm sure I'll be fine, Sam.”
Sam picks up her makeup and perfume and places them back on the dresser. “If you say so but believe me, you and Ryder were pretty hot together.”
“Sam!”
“Imagine doing it with a wolf though? With Bane. Do you think with him it would be rough sex with lots of sweat involved or slow passionate lovemaking?” Sam arches her brow at me.
I find myself walking out of her bedroom to somehow escape. “I'm not talking about this with you.”
Sam follows. “Yeah, but aren't you a little curious about what sex is like?” I turn to look at Sam.
“Honestly Sam, I haven't thought about it and it didn't even cross my mind.”
Sam sticks her tongue out playfully. “Until now.” “Look, we just kissed, that's all. No big deal.” End of discussion.
I turn back around and walk into the kitchen to put the kettle on. “Tea?”
“Please.”
Sam sits at the table and takes her phone out of her pocket. “Can I ask you a question?”
Sam puts her phone down on the table and frowns. “Sure.” “How did you have Ryder's number?”
Sam shifts her weight on the seat and plays with her phone. “I got it the other day at school when you and Max were getting food together. Ryder sat at the next table and he wanted to exchange numbers in case anything happened to you, so I gave it to him.”
“Oh. Then it's a good thing you had it.”
I place two teaspoons of sugar in each mug, grab two tea- bags, pour the hot water and milk into the mugs, throw away the tea-bag and stir the tea. I grab the two mugs and bring them over to the table.
“Look, he came here tonight to save you which obviously means he cares. The first thing he asked when he picked up the phone was if you were okay, and he didn't have to bother coming here tonight but he did. For you.”
Sam takes a sip of her tea.
I find myself not having anything to say to that, I just grab my mug of tea and take a sip.
“You can stay here tonight if you want.”
I place my mug back on the table and sigh. “You won't mind? I haven't been the best company tonight.”
Sam looks at me with shock. “Alice, you went through hell tonight and it's not your fault. Blame the wolf that bit you.”
“I don't wanna be like this forever, Sam. What if there's a cure out there somewhere?”
Sam shakes her head. “Alice, I don't think there will be. This new part of you is gonna be with you for the rest of your life, and somehow you're just gonna have to accept it, even if you don't want to.'
I stifle a yawn and nod. “Yeah, I guess you're right but I still can't believe this is happening to me. It's just not right.”
Sam smiles reassuringly at me. “There's nothing wrong with being what you are even though it's gonna change your life. You should embrace it.”
I don't say anything straight away but a part of me believes that what Sam says is right. “You're right, I can't change what's happened so I've just got to live with it.”
Sam gets out of her chair, takes her mug to the dishwasher and yawns. “You should know by now that I'm always right.”
“I can't argue with you on that.” I smile as I get up from the table.
“You can sleep in the spare bedroom if you want, for privacy.”
Sam waves as she makes her way up the stairs, “Night.” “Goodnight.” I whisper.
As I place the mug in the dishwasher and make my way to the spare bedroom, I think about the events of tonight. I managed to transform without hurting anybody other than Ryder, and besides he's not the one that got hurt.
In a way I felt glad that Ryder was there with me, but I can't help but think about the kiss we shared. Facing him tomorrow won't be something I'll be excited about, avoiding him sounds like a great idea right about now.
When I reach the spare bedroom, I see that Sam's given me something to wear for bed. I remove my clothes, put on the sweats and the vest then get into bed. The moment my head hits the pillow, I feel my eyes grow heavy, and soon find that I can't keep my eyes open.
Chapter 12

It's the last day of the week, and I couldn't be happier that it's finally Friday. This week has been beyond crazy, and I'm ready to put this week completely behind me.
When Sam comes to wake me up at 8, I get up from the bed, take a shower and wear the clothes that Sam has provided me with. I put on black skinny jeans and a band t-shirt that I'm unfamiliar with.
When I come downstairs, I see that Sam's mother has prepared us both breakfast.
“Morning Alice, did you sleep well?”
She grabs the steaming kettle and pours the hot water into three mugs.
I smile as I make my way to the table. “Morning Sally. I actually slept better than I thought I would.”
I cross my arms on the table and look out towards the window.
“Sam should be down in a minute. She's probably trying to decide what to wear to school.”
Sally brings a mug of tea over and places it in front of me.
I thank her and place my hands around the hot mug to keep my hands nice and warm.
Sally also brings over a plate with butter covered toast to the table and sits down next to me. “How's things at home? Your mom doing okay?” She grabs a little plate from the middle of the table and takes a piece of toast.
Things at home have been kinda strange since recent events. Before being bitten, I never once had a boy over at my house, let alone having four shapeshifters in my living room.
I take a sip from the mug and look at my best friend's mother. “Everything's fine and mom's always working at the hospital so I barely get to see her.”
Sally smiles warmly. “Your mother's always been a workaholic. I remember when your mother and I went to school together. She always carried a box of tissues with her at all times just in case someone got a nosebleed.”
I snicker. “Sounds like my mother.” I grab a piece of toast and take a bite.
“Everything alright at school? Sam mentioned that you've got a new English teacher?” Sally looks behind her at the clock and shakes her head.
I nod my head.
Do I mention what happened to Mr. Daniels to her or not?
“Yeah, Mr. Edmund has taken over the class.” I clear my throat. “And school? The same as always, I guess.”
Sally raises her brow. “Meaning?”
“Meaning...” Before I have a chance to answer I get interrupted.
“Meaning it's an absolutely pointless ritual that's full of hormonal teenage boys who drool at even a slight peak of cleavage.”
I'm looking at my best friend with my mouth hanging wide open; stunned into silence. When I think that her mother is going to yell at her daughter for being crude, Sally surprises me when she bursts out laughing. “The words that come out of your mouth, Sam.” She stands from the table and empties the contents into the sink. “You're definitely my daughter.”
Sam scoffs. “And here I thought I was adopted.”
Sam takes an apple from the fruit bowl that sits on the end of the table.
“Oh honey, sorry to disappoint you.”
Sally kisses the top of Sam's head and winks at me. “You girls have a good day at school.”
She waves and leaves the room.
When the house door closes I smirk towards Sam. “You wish you were adopted?”
“You would be too if you heard what goes on in this house.” Sam looks in the microwave and looks at herself through the reflection. “They're at it all the time.”
I may have thrown up a little in my mouth hearing about Sam's parents' love life. I guess with how close we are as best friends it's nice to know that she feels comfortable sharing things with me, but sharing things about her parents might just be a little bit too personal. “That's a little too much information, Sam.”
Sam turns around. “I bet sex with Ryder was on your mind last night.”
I groan. “Can you please not bring last night up again. I feel weird that you had to witness that.”
“Please.” Sam scoffs. “Last night was nothing compared to what I've done. My parents have caught me doing way worse things.”
I get up from the table, grab my shoes and bag from where I left them yesterday under the stairs.
“My dad chased a guy once right down the drive with a baseball bat in his hands. He never visited again.”
Sam grabs her keys and opens the front door.
“I don't blame the poor guy. No one would wanna mess with your dad.”
“That's what dads are for. Chasing away every guy on the planet who wants to date their daughter, I mean what would your dad.	” I turn to see her clenching her eyes
tightly. “Shit	I shouldn't have brought him up. I'm so sorry, Alice.”
In the past when people would ask a simple question like, 'what do your parents do?' I always responded with a lie. For eighteen years, I've learnt to accept the fact that he isn't coming back to me and my mother. Besides, after all these years I don't think she'd want anything to do with him. I remember the days when she'd lock herself in her room and never come out, I'd sit outside her bedroom door for hours just to make sure that she was still breathing.
Being that young and oblivious, I didn't know what was happening, there was nothing I could do to make her happy. I see it sometimes on her face when she isn't looking, the faraway look she has in her eyes, and it makes me wonder if she actually misses him. It was hard seeing my mother lost like that, I never want to see my mother in that state ever again.
I shrug. “There's nothing to be sorry for. It's not your fault my dad just up and left.”
She sighs. “I know that we don't talk about it. It's just, why?” Sam shakes her head. “Do you ever wonder why he left?”
“Yeah, but after all these years I've stopped asking myself why because I'm not gonna find the answer. He's gone and I'd rather he didn't come back.”
“And if he did?”
I clench my jaw. “I'd make him wish that he made a big mistake coming back here.”
When me and Sam arrive at school, we both part ways to our lessons; Sam making her way towards Math while I make my way towards Biology. I quietly walk to my desk at the front but realize that Max hasn't arrived yet.
Maybe he's running late?
He's probably missed the bus or something. I'd understand if he didn't come after what happened to him yesterday. I can't help but picture Max's beaten face, and it makes me want to check up on him to see if he's okay.
