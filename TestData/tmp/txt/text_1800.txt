I look towards Ryder to see him scowling at the teacher. “I'm not fond of the silent treatment, Ryder.”
Mr. Edmund leans right into Ryder's face. “I mean, is it really that hard to remember what I said? I'll take that as a yes! Are you deaf? Incompetent or just lazy?”
Again, Ryder says nothing.
“You disappoint me Ryder, just like Alice here.”
Mr. Edmund waits a little longer at Ryder's desk then strides towards Bane's desk.
“And what about you Bane? Will you be the one to tell me what I said yesterday?”
Bane looks at him with distaste. “Nope.”
Mr. Edmund chuckles and walks to the classroom door. “Seeing as this lesson has not gone to plan, class is dismissed.”
Students begin to gather their things and rush to leave the classroom. I look at Sam in confusion to see her smiling as she gets up from her seat and leaves the room. She's probably waiting for me outside the class so that she can beg me to go to the party with her tonight.
