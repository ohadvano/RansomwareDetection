
The house is silent and slightly cold, but that doesn't stop the thoughts from rushing inside my head. I'm far from happy about the fact that I'll have to learn the wolf way by someone that I can barely stand, let alone talk to.
There has to be another way surely?
I'd take lessons with Bane first before learning anything from Ryder after what I saw tonight. Max's face will again be on my mind for a while, and until I find out all the answers that are left unresolved, I'm left feeling incomplete - I can't think of anything as to why Ryder did what he did.
I lie wide awake in my bed when I hear the door to my house closing downstairs. I lie awake most nights just to hear my mum coming through that door at ridiculous hours, and yet she still returns to the hospital. She loves doing what she does best - the things she can do mesmerizes me.
I turn to my side; away from the door and shut my eyes ready for sleep to overtake me.
When I hear the door to my bedroom open gently, I smile happily to myself. Not once has my mother forgotten to check on me straight when she comes home. In a way, I think she does it to reassure herself that I'm still here with her.
She never says anything to me, she has a quick look to see if I'm asleep and then leaves quietly, and she never closes the door. So when I hear the door start closing and footsteps approaching my bed, I know something isn't right. I swiftly turn the lamp on placed on my bedside table and turn to face whoever's entered my room.
It doesn't matter how many times I see him, he'll always make me feel nervous, but for some reason seeing him here right now, makes me forget about the argument we had earlier.
