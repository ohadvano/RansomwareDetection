Kiran finished up with another load of semen that stung the Shirksire’s cervix.
“Ouch!” was her response.
Finally drained, Kiran fell on his back. Shirksire collapsed and Gatril rolled off her. All three individuals were on the floor, and one by one they all fell asleep.

When they woke up Kiran quickly made the spell, with Shirksire seated before him and looking intently.
“So you can only use queex?” said Shirksire.
“No,” Kiran said as he mixed the contents in the bowl. “But in my case it makes for a unique spell, plus I also want the battle experience.”
“…I see,” Shirksire said. “Are you sure you are not a sexplorer?”
Kiran laughed. “Don’t get me wrong, I love sex, but not as much as I love magic.” Kiran finished making a white orb with grey ripples. He tossed between his hands, waiting for it to dry. “However, I still feel a little urge to have intercourse with bea…ferrans. They have such different flavors.”
“Are you his girlfriend, bosdrake?” Shirksire said.
“Friend with benefits,” Gatril replied. “You can join the group too, if you want.”
Shirksire pontificated on the offer, tapping her index finger from three of her hands. “I would love to have someone teach me magic, but I…”
Kiran was putting the orb into the fifth and final socket when he looked up at Shirksire’s troubled expression. “What is it?”
Shirksire said, “I feel much safe in this cave than outside.”
“Trust me,” said Gatril, “someone like you wouldn’t have much to fear. You just need to mark out your own territory. You can even stay with me if you wan to.”
“Really…?” Shirksire said, half rising from her seat. 
“Of course,” said Gatril. “I’m close to where Kiran lives. He can always visit us.”
Then Shirksire’s elation dwindled when she realized something. “…But my books…There are a lot of them.”
“If you’ve ready read them, then you don’t need them anymore,” said Kiran. “If you were trying to learn magic, they obviously weren’t helpful.”
Shirksire smiled. “Your offer does sound tempting. I must considerate, though.”
“No problem,” said Kiran, getting up. “Now let’s see if this works…”
Kiran channeled his spirit energy into the staff and pointed to the gun next to Gatril. A thick strand of silk spewed from the orb and attached to the weapon, and Karin yanked it towards him and caught it.
“A web…” Shirksire remarked.
“Just in case I can’t reach something from where I am,” said Kiran. “So, shall we all leave? This cave is getting a bit cramped now.”
Shirksire got up. “Right this way…”
Shirksire lead them to out of the cave into the ruins of the town, where the male spiders awaiting them, peering from atop the buildings and inside through the windows. However, any thoughts of making an attack on the human and bosdrake where stalled by the presence of their female.
“What will you do about them?” said Gatril as she walked by the arachnids.
“I’ll still keep them around as a deterrent from travelers,” Shirksire said, watching Kiran hurry towards his quacycle and check for any damages. 
The sun was setting in the distance, and long shadows were strewn from the trees across the ground. The air was cool, and Kiran felt relaxed now that his entire mission was complete. When they were out on the highway, Kiran and Gatril faced Shirksire, about to say their final goodbyes.
“When will you be back?” said Shirksire.
“Within a month’s time, after the tournament is finished,” said Kiran. “If I get my sorcerer’s license, I can keep beasts…or ferrans as my pets. In this case, you would be my partner. It means you could walk amongst human’s freely without any persecution. Then we can study new magic together.”
Shirksire smiled. “I like the sound of that.” She knelt over Kiran, held his cheeks and kissed him on his forehead. “I’ll be seeing you, Kiran…”
“You too, Shirksire,” said the young man.
“We should get going,” said Gatril. “bultungins usually get active at night. And we already pissed off a gang of them.”
Kiran and Gatril got on the quacycle and rode off, while Shirksire walked back to the town.
