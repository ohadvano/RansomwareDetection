A flame burnt in a bronze urn close to the wall, and the essence of freshly sundered wood and mint seeped from it. Thick branches were stuck to the walls of the chamber, holding enough books that seemed to be the humble beginnings of a library. In the corners of the room were trinkets, jewelry that sparkled from the grace of the flames. And in the center, there she was.
It was something humanoid, female in shape, but the body parts composed of jointed limbs and a segmented torso. She had four long arms, each ending in four digits, and her pelvis was squishy looking and pink, contrasting the brown of her chitinous body. The thighs were thick and attached to the outermost of pelvis, from which a long tail hung, tipped with spinnerets. Her six eyes were occupied by a book before, her mandibles clicking thoughtfully as she processed the information, and she briefly brushed back a lock of her black hair with a hand.
But the legs weren’t set in preparation for a lunging attack. The hands weren’t about to wring their necks, and her fangs weren’t dripping neurotoxin in the hindsight of puncturing their flesh. Even when she lifted her head from the book she was reading and spared them a glance, she looked away, only to do a double take as if surprised by who was there instead of the fact that they snuck up upon her.
“Who are you two?” she said, her voice high pitched but grainy.
“My name is Kiran Kehomba,” the boy said. “I’m sorcerer seeking the queex of a j’bafofi. I came here seeking your assistance.”
The six eyes turned to the bosdrake. “And who is this?” the spider said.
“I’m Gatril,” she said. “I’m his friend.”
The spider closed the book, and between her mandibles they could see her lips making a smile. “This is quite the surprise. I was just reading a tale about a human female, falling in love with a beast. To think I’d see something similar even here. The universe must like me.”
Kiran said, “I don’t mean to be rude, mam, but I want to ask you a few questions.”
“You come into my domain, and want to question me?” the spider narrowed her eyes.
Kiran and Gatril’s nerves went array, and their spines wanted out through their backs,
“Shit,” said Gatril. “Quick, Kiran offer to eat her crotch!”
Kiran was a stuttering wreck: “I-I-I-I—”
“Enough!” said Gatril. She approached the spider, flinching when she saw the size of her mandibles. Seven inches. The size of Kiran’s cock. “Now look here!” Gatril pointed, but her finger was too close to the spider’s face and she dropped it. “We just—”
The spider grabbed Gatril by the throat. Gatril tired prying her hand open but the spider’s strength was more than hears, a mighty dragon.
Kiran’s spine suddenly straightened in his back. “Gatril!” He approached the spider. His staff raised with orb for the force-counter pulsing. “Put her down! Please!”
“My,” the spider said, her mandibles salivating. “I’ve never had a dragon before.”
“Bitch!” Gatril squeaked.
“I said drop her!” Kiran boomed.
The spider finally recognized Kiran’s killing intent and payed him heed. She sensed a supernatural force emanating from his staff, and narrowed two of her eyes at him. “You’re a sorcerer…”
“That’s right,” Kiran said, trying his best to contain his rage. “Now put her down before I tear this place down!”
The spider dropped Gatril, not out of fear, but intrigue with the human. Gatril gasped for air and retreated behind Kiran. “You freaky bug! The next time you do that you’ll regret it!”
The spider rose, tendons and chitinous body parts rubbing together like sandpaper. At three meters, she towered over them.
“Human, how many spells do you know?” said the spider.
“Four,” said Kiran. He and Gatril looked at each other with uncertainty. 
“Why would a spider be interested in spells?” said Gatril.
“Isn’t it obvious by what your eyes see?” said the arachnid. “I’ve become enlightened. I no longer thrive on my instincts except to feed to maintain my health.”
“Is that why you haven’t laid any eggs?” said Gatril.
“Yes,” she replied. “I’ve recently stopped accepting offers from the males. They are lowly beasts. Not bright in the head. I’ve sharpened my mind, nourishing it with the knowledge of humans.”  She showed them her hand, conjuring within it a ghostly white energy that danced like a swirling mist.
“That’s…spirit energy,” Kiran said.
The spider closed her hand and the energy vanished. “I’ve grown fond of this power that some humans possess, to point where I managed to discover it in myself. Kiran, if you can teach me about magic, I can give you the queex you want.”
“What?” Gatril turned to Kiran, expecting to see him speechless just like her, but the boy smiling much to her dismay.
“Wow!” said Kiran. “That sounds like a fair trade.”
Gatril grabbed Kiran by the shoulders and quickly walked him back to the mouth of the room. “What are you doing?” Gatril whispered.
“What’s wrong?” said Kiran.
