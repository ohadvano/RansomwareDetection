"Those are good questions posed by the DCNX news reporter. We have in our studio a political consultant who has worked with the new Acting President. Mr. Holland, you have worked with him, so what can you tell our viewers about his background, and what we might expect him to do? I mean, most people have barely heard of him. And now he is the Acting President at a most unusual time of crisis."
Joe Holland: "Well, Jill, he is an enigma. I have dealt with him on several occasions yet I still do not know what to think about him. He rose to power very quickly and out of nowhere, going from State office to Speaker of the House after a series of highly unusual circumstances, including a couple mysterious deaths which eventually were ruled suicides. He seems to have been launched out of a cannon into his current position, and it is especially significant that he is from the opposing party to the former President and VP, which changes the political landscape dramatically. He is a hard-core and committed progressive-leftist, and I mean extreme left, which makes him a political disrupter. He is an environmental activist, even to the point of worshiping nature, although he is otherwise an atheist. He brings a deep distrust of religion into the position, especially Christianity, something which brought him into conflict with both the previous President and VP. Acting President Antivon is extremely ambitious and even brash, so I would expect him to take full advantage of the crisis caused by the Vanishment. His eloquence can be riveting, which enables him to convince the masses to follow him. That is something very surreal about him, that he can be so convincing to great crowds of people. There is something "other-worldly" about it, and..."
Jill: "I'm sorry to interrupt, but you just said 'other-worldly'. What do you mean?"
Joe Holland: "I am not even sure what I mean. I suppose there is simply something eerie, even supernatural, about how he can sway people. They find him mesmerizing in a Svengali sort of way. Otherwise I just cannot explain it."
Jill: "OK, please go on, Mr. Holland."
Joe Holland: "Anyway, since he has now been catapulted to the highest office in the land, it is unclear how he will use his power to further his ambitions, but it is certain that he will use every bit of power he can accumulate to himself. I personally view him as someone who wants to accomplish big things. I mean really, really big things. World changing things. He is not a patient man, and will act quickly and decisively to put in place policies to carry out his aggressive agenda. I worry about what he might do under Martial Law emergency conditions, which gives him immense power. And one more thing I must add about him, he gives me a very uneasy feeling, especially his stare, which is unnerving. There is something about him as a person which I do not understand, but it leaves me feeling unnerved. He is a very different type of individual. Almost like talking to more than one person -- I mean it is like there is something inside of him which defies worldly explanation. That is the only way to say it."
"OK, thanks for those insights Mr. Holland." Jill says as she turns toward the camera: "We will seek to provide a more in-depth profile on Acting President Antivon and attempt to answer some of these questions about him as soon as we have more information to report. After a break we will provide an update on what has happened so far today. A most unusual day, indeed."
After a very long day which began with many millions of people simply vanishing, LANX anchor Jill Stein turns over anchor duties to Sarah Boswell who continues with the news, trying desperately to keep up.
CHAPTER 3
THE FOUR HORSEMEN

That evening at her apartment, Jill Steiner has the news running in the background while she also reads a book she found on the internet called "The Future Times." It was the book mentioned in the online video which was aired on her news show earlier in the day. She reads to herself from the book:
"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, which are Dictatorship, War, Economic Disaster, and Death, will now begin to unfold.  These first four of seven Seals will reveal historical trends which will be pervasive throughout the entire seven year period of the Tribulation, which has just begun.  They reveal the trends which will occur in a very intense and sustained manner throughout the entirety of the Tribulation.  Later there will be specific Bowl and Trumpet judgments unsealed throughout the course of the Tribulation.  The Lord Himself, as Judge of the world, has broken open the 1st Seal."
Revelation 6:1 “I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, “Come!”
"Thunder in the distance warns of the coming storm. The gathering storm early during the Tribulation will be a set of extreme judgments on the earth, and the time for those judgments has arrived."
Revelation 6:2 “I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.”
"Seal #1 is the White Horse of dictatorship under the Antichrist who will strip mankind of their personal freedoms and force upon them a false satanic religion.  So-called “democratic” forms of government will be pushed aside and replaced by strong-armed dictators around the world.  The strongest of them will be the Antichrist, also called the Beast, or the Antichrist.  This man of Satan will appear very early during the Tribulation and deceive the masses into giving up personal liberties in exchange for a promise of collective security under his dictatorship.  The Antichrist will appear to be a leader on a white horse coming to the rescue, but instead he will be a force for great evil who enslaves millions of people.  Early during the Tribulation he will not be seen as a force for evil, and will use cunning speeches and selective warfare to gain his position, and then will assume dictatorship rule over a ten nation confederation.  Revelation 6:2 means “he conquers, so that he may conquer”.  This demon-possessed Antichrist conquers so Satan might gain power through him, and Satan will set him up as an idol to be worshiped by mankind.  So the white horse is dictatorship and loss of personal freedoms as a result of the Antichrist seizing power through conquest, which will continue and intensify throughout the entire Tribulation.  Once these first Seals are opened they reveal ongoing historical trend judgments, so once they begin, they continue throughout the entire Tribulation."
Jill puts down her book and thinks to herself about what happened today, as she tries to make sense of it all. So many horrible things occurred, and all at the same time. "What is the meaning of it, was this really the Rapture of the Church? Or some type of unexplained Vanishment as national leaders are now calling it? Can it really be the beginning of a period of Great Tribulation?" she asks of herself, with no answers.
As the day finally ends Jill is endlessly searching through internet news feeds and blogs.  A website has been set up to help those searching for loved ones who vanished, and she looks at the faces of those who were alive this morning, but now are gone.  The numbers are staggering, and estimated to be well over 100 million.  She falls asleep still wondering what it is all about...
In Jerusalem it is early morning, and the group of nearly a hundred young men have re- gathered on the Temple Mount to continue their discussion from the previous day. Shem Kolb, their de facto leader, asks for their attention as they draw near to listen to him. "Fellow Jews, we are at a crossroads. The issue has been made clear to us that we missed our Messiah Jesus Christ the first time around. We will not make that same mistake again. I ask you to join with me as new believers who will carry forth the message of the Messiah to our own nation Israel and also the entire world. The message of the Messiah must be proclaimed, and time is very short. All believers were removed from the earth by the Rapture, and now new believers must learn how to evangelize.  The Bible says the Messiah will return to earth seven years after the Rapture, and says there will be a core group of Jewish believers who must perform the task of evangelization.  We are the beginning of the 144,000 who will perform that task.  Are you ready?"  Cheers of agreement erupt among the group as these new Jewish believers eagerly await direction from Shem regarding their assignments.  As they prepare to depart, Shem asks them to quickly spread the message about what has really happened, and what it means.
Back at home on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Shem talks with his wife about what he has come to believe.
The morning alarm awakens Jill Steiner and her first thought is "Was it all a dream?"  She turns on the news.  No, it was real.  Day 2 is beginning.  She wonders to herself what today will bring as she hurries off to the studio.
Back at the anchor desk Jill begins her broadcast.  She had only recently been promoted to the position as news anchor of the LANX Morning Show.  It was quite a jump for someone only 27 years old.  Now she is reporting the biggest news in years, maybe decades.  It is only 24 hours after the Vanishment occurred.
Jill: "Good morning LA. We continue with news coverage of the Vanishment. There is a lot to cover but here is a very quick rundown on what we have learned so far:
1)  At approximately 10:20 AM yesterday the Vanishment occurred. People just disappeared. The numbers from around the world are estimated to be more than 100 million people.
2)  The US was hardest hit by the Vanishment, while it was virtually a non-event in the Middle East, Far East, and some portions of Africa. The numbers are highest in the south and southeastern United States.
3)  The cause is listed officially by government leaders as "an undefined Vanishment"
4)  The US President and VP vanished. The Speaker of the House was sworn in as Acting President.
5)  The people who vanished left behind their personal effects, namely clothing they were wearing, jewelry, glasses, phones, and so on at the point where they vanished.
6)  Nationwide, there were huge numbers of traffic accidents, a large number of airplane and train accidents, numerous industrial accidents, unattended critical infrastructure incidents resulting in power outages and countless other accidents, incidents and disruptions.
7)  Many people did not show up where they were expected. People on airplanes vanished and their clothing was left in the seat they had occupied. Numerous small stores were left unattended as owners or clerks did not return to close the shops. And other cases where people should have been in certain places but they were not, however their clothing was there in a pile.
8)  Some eyewitnesses saw people vanish and their clothing fall to the ground as they were talking to them. One person reported: "We were talking and suddenly there was only a pile of clothing where he was standing." Another eyewitness who was a passenger in a car which crashed said the driver was talking and in mid-sentence there was only a pile of clothing in the car seat, and then the car crashed."
9)  Most of those who vanished appeared to be Christians, however some clergy and high level church leaders remain. These are often from certain progressive denominations, but also some long established ones.
10)  The US Congress is in disarray as many Members are missing. There are not enough Senators to have a quorum for many types of voting. The balance of power in the Senate has also changed as the former President's party no longer has a majority of seats since it lost more Members to the Vanishment. This will likely allow Acting President Antivon to secure his power base more quickly.
There is much more, but that is a very quick rundown on what happened yesterday."
Jill continues: "So this is where we are just 24 hours into this phenomena, a Vanishment, or whatever it was.  We go now to where we began the reporting just 24 hours ago, to SkyCopter News reporter Sean Thompson who broke the story yesterday morning in the skies over the LA Basin.  Over to you, Sean:"
"Jill, that's right, just 24 hours ago our helicopter emerged over the San Gabriel mountain range to unveil a sea of chaos in the LA basin."  Sean reminds himself not to be overly dramatic.  "We witnessed clogged freeways.  We saw multiple burning locations, mostly traffic accidents, one airplane crash site, and some industrial accidents.  Now just 24 hours later, with the wrecker trucks having worked non-stop through the night, most freeways are at least minimally passable, although some bridges are closed for inspection.  Most people have stayed home at the request of the Mayor, and the new President has declared a state of emergency, both of which have helped ease the chaos. Essential services are getting back into operation, although slowly. Power outages remain a big problem. The city is returning to a minimally functional state, but only because most people have remained at home. From what we can see from the air, the city seems to have a surreal calm about it." Skip the drama, Sean reminds himself. "Reporting from Sky News, Sean Thompson reporting. Jill, back to you." Sean turns to pilot Tommy Jackson and says "I was a bit dramatic there." "Don't worry" Tommy replied, "for a newbie who was thrust into this yesterday on his first day, you have done just fine. It's not as though we were simply reporting on a fender-bender on the I-5 freeway and then went back to have donuts at the airport."
Jill: "We go now to our reporter Phil Stewart on the street in downtown LA for a walking view of the aftermath of the Vanishment. Phil, what do you see down there?"
"Jill, I have been out walking the streets of downtown LA, both yesterday and this morning. Yesterday I saw chaos as people were screaming that their loved ones, friends, co-workers, and other people had vanished. People were running and screaming in sheer terror and confusion. They had seen something normally reserved for a bad movie. Today it is much calmer, as the streets are mainly empty as people have generally remained home. A few homeless people have formed crude signs with the words "REPENT, THE END IS NEAR" on them. Nothing really new about that. But I have also seen several stores which were never locked up yesterday, and they remain open. A pile of clothes is generally found behind the counter, or elsewhere in those small stores. Very eerie.  Some of those stores have been looted, and looting is a real problem down here today. Police can't do much about it as they are overwhelmed. Just now I see several people running down the street with piles of stuff in their hands, yelling gleefully. I can tell you that I don't feel safe down here myself. The loss of order is just one of the disturbing issues we will need to consider as we move about the city.
Otherwise, given what we have been through during the past 24 hours, I can say that at least no additional people seem to have vanished today.  Jill."
Jill: "Thanks, Phil. We will continue to keep our viewers updated on events as they unfold. Back in just a minute..."
Over the next week, events continue to unfold on the world stage. Overall, the disruptions were confined to mostly Christian areas of the world, such as the US, Europe, and a few other regions. A couple small nations in central Africa were also hit hard. But the US was most severely affected, and was in a chaotic state. President Antivon was confirmed by Congress as President, which ended the "Acting" President issue. He appointed a political unknown as his VP who was previously the head of an environmental activist group. Martial Law continues in effect as President Antivon uses it as a means to implement aggressive political moves, and he signs numerous Executive orders putting controversial and far-reaching polices into effect without the consent of Congress. There is internal tension in the US due to the extreme measures being put in place by the new President. Dissent steadily grows as people see a loss of freedom setting in.
Jill Steiner is at home continuing to read "The Future Times." She does not yet know what to think about that issue. She never had any belief system outside of getting ahead as a reporter. It is what she had always wanted to do with her life. But she finds the book interesting, at least. She reads about what the Bible says will happen during the first half of the Tribulation:
"Now the Lord opens the 2nd Seal, the Fiery Red Horse of war.
Revelation 6:3 “When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!” 4 Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword.”
Seal #2 is the Fiery Red Horse and its rider.  This signifies four great armies which will engage in nearly constant worldwide war during the Tribulation, including the army of the Antichrist.  Despots seeking power will take peace from the earth, meaning a continuous world war affecting the entire earth.  The four spheres of power on the earth are the Kings of the North, South, East, and West, who will battle each other.  The resulting wars will include conventional, guerrilla, terrorism, and even nuclear war.
This is what was prophesied by Jesus just days before the cross: “You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end [Second Advent] is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.”  (Matthew 24: 6-7)
This horseman of war will be an historical trend, not a single event. There will be specific battles during later judgments, but the Fiery Red Horse means a world war will start almost immediately and wage during the remainder of the Tribulation. The Rapture will lead to great instability among the nations, and dictators will rush in to take advantage of the chaotic situation."
Jill did not realize it yet, but the world would soon see that the Four Horsemen had just arrived. Global war was at the doorstep. The first installment came quickly and unexpectedly.
CHAPTER 4
EZEKIEL'S PROPHECY FULFILLED

In Russia, the Kremlin leadership is meeting to finalize a war plan which would take advantage of the chaos in the West. The military leaders present their two-pronged offensive plan, whereby two Russian army groups will advance along separate tracks, and meet in the mountains of Jordan east of Israel. From there they will invade Israel with the ultimate objective being the capture of Jerusalem. The whole operation should take no more than one week. President Zhukov gives his final agreement to the bold plan. Time is of the essence.
The world is in chaos. The invasion is set to begin in 48 hours.
Two days later Russian military forces are detected by US satellites heading toward the Middle East. They are in two columns driving southward at great speed. President Antivon puts the US military on high alert.
While their forces are driving through southern Russia, the two Russian Army Group commanders review their plan for taking their objective, which is Jerusalem:
Gen. Ivanov: "My forces will drive through northern Syria, while you drive through Iran and southern Syria. This will confuse the West regarding our intentions. We will meet at Damascus, then push south together to Amman, Jordan, where we will cross into Israel toward Jerusalem."
Gen. Kokoff: "With the West in confusion, Israel should be an easy target for us. I'll see you at Damascus."
In Washington DC, President Antivon and staff discuss the massing of Russian forces in southern Russia. President Antivon: "What are they planning? They obviously think the crisis of the Vanishment will allow them to take advantage of the chaos in the world. But we need to wait and see what move they make before we do anything."
US Military Commander: "The Russians are planning something big.  They appear to be highly focused on the Middle East, and Israel in particular. Their forces are not massing along their southern border, they are moving fast and intend to keep going. We have intercepted a large number of communications discussing Israel. I would expect an invasion to their south any day now."
President Antivon: "We will take a wait and see approach. I cannot act now since their intentions are unclear." The Joint Chiefs suggest there should be movement of US naval vessels into the eastern Mediterranean. President Antivon agrees.
The following day two Russian Army Groups depart from southern Russia headed farther south by separate routes. Within two days they have merged their forces and are passing through Jordan east of Israel. They are moving rapidly without resistance. Just as they turn west and head through the mountains toward Israel the skies turn a ghostly gray, with swirling clouds tinged with red streaks. Suddenly, fiery hail begins to fall. Large burning boulders streak across the sky and fall directly on the Russian forces. The tanks and armored vehicles leading the military column through the mountains are crushed and burn as if they were plastic toys. Thousands of troops who were behind them but still in the plains are screaming in unison as they burn to death. The Russian forces are quickly wiped out. After only half an hour, a scene of burned-out wreckage of war machines and countless dead and burned bodies are everywhere. No one escaped alive. But most of the supplies were spared, including a large amount of food, dozens of fuel trucks, and an enormous amount of other materiel and supplies.
Israeli news media reports the incident as a stunning destruction of the invading Russian forces trying to invade Israel. It is reported as a freak weather event, although the fiery hail and boulders from the sky cannot be explained.
In Jerusalem the group of new Jewish believers led by Shem Kolb has expanded at an incredible rate.  What started as just a couple dozen new believers has now bloomed to 144,000 in just one week.  Shem, the leader of these 144,000 new Jewish believers, is meeting with the core group while the rest are listening online.  He reads from the book "The Future Times" to explain what has just happened:
"One of the very first wars during the Tribulation is described in Ezekiel Chapter 39 where the King of the North and his allies attack Israel. This is not the Armageddon campaign, which will occur seven years from now at the end of the Tribulation.
Ezekiel 39:2 “I will bring you [King of the North] from the far north and send you against the mountains of Israel. 3 Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand. 4 On the mountains of Israel you will fall, you and all your troops and the nations with you. I will give you as food to all kinds of carrion birds and to the wild animals. 5 You will fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD... I will make known my holy name among my people Israel.”
The King of the North sees an opportunity to attack Israel shortly after the Rapture has caused massive disruption on the earth, especially among those nations supporting Israel. During the Ezekiel 39 battle the King of the North will be soundly defeated in the mountains of Israel as God Himself rains down fire from Heaven on the enemy army, which then retreats in defeat."
Shem pauses from reading to explain the significance.  "You see how these events occurred exactly as the Prophet Ezekiel said it would be, and this was well over 2500 years ago.  And listen to the reason this has occurred.  This books explains that Israel will need the remnants of the war machines to survive the next seven years:"
"There are several reasons this war must occur very early during the Tribulation. First, Israel will burn the weapons of the defeated army for fuel for seven years, which puts the battle at the very beginning of the Tribulation. Ezekiel 39:9 “Then those who live in the towns of Israel will go out and use the weapons for fuel and burn them up—the small and large shields, the bows and arrows, the war clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them for fuel. The inhabitants of Israel are given this extra fuel because the Tribulation will be a time of economic disaster, so the Jews in Israel will need the fuel and supplies for survival during that seven year period.
The second reason this war occurs during the early part of the Tribulation is because it is one of two miraculous events which will be used by God to cause Jews to lose their blindness toward Jesus Christ as Savior, resulting in many Jews being saved early in the Tribulation.  The Rapture is the first event, as discussed by the Apostle Paul in Romans 11:25: “Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.”  Then shortly after the Rapture the Ezekiel 39 war occurs and God gives Israel a miraculous deliverance from the huge army of the King of the North who attacks during the time of chaos caused by the Rapture.  If not for this miraculous deliverance, Israel would be destroyed.  When discussing this war Ezekiel 39:22 says: “From that day forward the people of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God.” This shows how the divine deliverance from certain disaster changes the view of many Jews toward Jesus Christ, resulting in them becoming believers in large numbers.
Recall that a main purpose of the Tribulation is to bring many Jews to salvation so they will go into the Millennial Kingdom.  Then later in the same Chapter Ezekiel 39:27  says: “When I have brought them back from the nations and have gathered them from the countries of their enemies, I will be proved holy through them in the sight of many nations.”  Note the “When I have brought them back” describes the restoration of Israel as a future event which will occur seven years later at the end of the Tribulation, which further identifies the timing of this war.  Furthermore, the Ezekiel 39 war cannot occur before the Rapture since no prophetic event of the Old Testament can occur during the Church Age since the Church was not allowed to be revealed until Israel formally rejected Jesus Christ and His Kingdom (Millennium).  Jesus had to legitimately offer the Kingdom to Israel but could not have done so if there was any Church Age prophecy which must be fulfilled.  There is no prophecy to be fulfilled during the Church Age except for the Rapture itself, and this war is an Old Testament prophesy which has not yet occurred, and cannot occur until the Tribulation has begun.
The King of the North will pay a terrible price, suffering a devastating loss of people and equipment which will keep him out of the political and military picture until late in the Tribulation when he attacks the King of the West."
Shem adds after reading from the book: "It is all just as was written about in Ezekiel 39, and has been explained in this book written long ago. Let us go out to the mountains and see for ourselves."
At the same time a Rabbi from northern Israel who recently converted to Christianity is being interviewed on Israeli TV:
Reporter: "Rabbi Cohen, what is the significance of the defeat of the Russian forces in the mountains of Jordan?"
Rabbi Cohen: "We have seen the protection of our nation by God Himself alone, as Ezekiel 39 explains.  This is a day of great celebration of God's victory over our enemies.  Truly our Messiah will return in less than seven years from now, and then we will go into a Millennium where the Lord Himself will rule for 1000 years.  For now, the King of the North has been dealt a mortal blow.  But the forces of the Antichrist are coming for us in the near future.  We must prepare.  Time is short.”
CHAPTER 5
THE ANTICHRIST EMERGES

In Washington DC, President Antivon and advisers discuss what happened in Jordan as the Russian forces were destroyed. What happened to them? No one can explain it, but it is viewed as fortuitous. President Antivon praised the "Harmonic Convergence of the Universe" for the events. With the Russians suffering a great defeat, President Antivon sees it as a sign to him that he is the chosen one who has been given mystical powers and was sent to save the earth. His self-view of being a god is intensified by the events, which serves to embolden him to press forward with his grand plans for re-making the world order. President Antivon discusses his plans for uniting the various Western nations into a unified Western Alliance.
Plans include first negotiating with the EU, but if not successful, attacking three of the larger European nations, then the rest will fall into line. President Antivon is in a hurry to get this done. And the recent Russian defeat has accelerated his schedule. President Antivon: "This is our chance to remake the world. Let us not waste it." He gives orders to move quickly to put in place a plan to take over Western Europe. Rumblings of opposition within the military ranks is met with the removal of several high ranking Generals, and some are imprisoned.
Along with the military strategy, President Antivon takes swift action to nationalize all social media in the US, making it his mouthpiece and a means to control the citizens. He declares a climate change emergency and uses it as the basis for further restrictions of individual freedoms. He tells his Chief of Staff to plan and implement an economic control system, some sort of "mark" which will require compliance with his dictates in order to engage in any economic activity, to buy or sell. Gun confiscation is put in place. Martial Law will be further enhanced in his upcoming speech to the nation, along with more Executive Orders and a Declaration of National Emergency. With those in place, who needs a Congress or Supreme Court?
Negotiations with European leaders to unite the Western nations prove fruitless and seem doomed to fail as European leaders resist his initiatives. President Antivon decides to move forward with the military option to take over the Western nations by force. He gives orders to take over three countries, including Germany, France and Italy, and the rest will have no option but to capitulate. This plan is set to begin in one week.
President Antivon appears at the UN annual meeting and announces that all Western Nations must join him in a military/economic coalition which will be the strongest in the world.
Several European leaders push back on his aggressive approach. They call him "arrogant and foolish" which further inflames him. President Antivon declares that there will be a coalition one way or another. Several Western leaders walk out. Antivon is not impressed.
President Antivon meets with his senior military leaders and announces his plan:
"US forces in NATO will simultaneously take over the governments of Germany, France and Great Britain. The leaders of these three nations are to be taken captive and the government buildings taken over. The three nations will have no option but to yield and join as subordinate nations to a Western Alliance. Our plan is to get them to capitulate without invasion if possible, or by invasion if necessary, and then the others will join willingly. If the others do not join us, their countries will be invaded and taken over by force."
The plan shocks most in the room who hear it, but the example set by removing many of their fellow Generals made it clear there will be no dissension. The plan is put into motion. The power position of President Antivon will be firmly solidified by the formation of a Western Alliance under his command, and his plans for further world conquest can then be launched having the most powerful combined military force in the world. This is risky, but it is what Antivon does. He is in it to either win it all or lose it all.
Two weeks later the leaders of France, Germany and Great Britain are captured and held hostage by President Antivon's troops. The leaders protest but cannot overcome their dire situation. A US envoy from President Antivon contacts each one and tells them "We can do this together, or we can do this without you. Make your choice." Having no other option, the three leaders agree to join the Western Alliance under President Antivon's leadership.
The following day President Antivon addresses the nation: "For a very long time national leaders have talked about solving the world's problems. They just talked and talked but what was ever accomplished by it? Nothing. Climate change is ruining our planet. The enemies of the West are plotting against us. Internal enemies of the State engage in subterfuge, as new Christians emerge and apply their hatred for the progressive ideals we believe in. It is only a matter of time before the Middle East is engulfed in war. We can and must act now to solve these issues before they destroy us all. That is why I ordered our military forces stationed in Europe to seize the capitals of France, Germany and Great Britain. Our forces have already accomplished this first phase, and we are now negotiating the terms of our new world order with the European Union. The time has come. This is our chance to remake the world. We must not waste this opportunity."
The following day the remaining European nations capitulate and agree to submit to the leadership of President Antivon under a combined Western Alliance, which becomes the most powerful alliance in the world by far. News of the events catch the Russian and Chinese by surprise. They are shocked, but do not have the power to take on this huge new alliance. Both begin regional alliance negotiations with neighboring countries, even though some of those are their enemies.
China's leadership gathers in emergency session in Beijing to discuss the recently formed Western Alliance. Premier Zhou begins: "We have seen the aggression by the US which has greatly upset the balance of power in the world. We cannot stand by and watch as they take more and more power to themselves. They are already very powerful and will gain even more power, likely in areas where we have influence such as Africa. We must find new alliances for ourselves to offset the West. And with the recent disastrous defeat of the Russians and their Northern Alliance, they cannot provide any effective counter to the West. We must consolidate power here in the Eastern sphere to avoid being the next casualty of the West."
A similar emergency meeting is also in session among Middle East and North African countries, many of them long established enemies. The discussions were much the same as in the Eastern sphere. The power accumulation by the West has forced these countries to seek a Southern Alliance in an attempt to repel any attempts to take them over one by one. And the potential Southern Alliance members not only fear the West, but also the Northern and the Eastern Alliances. In these times of accumulation of power, no one could be trusted to leave the Middle East and North Africa alone, since the countries in those areas were viewed as a source of gaining power in the Mediterranean region close to several Western Alliance member countries. An agreement is quickly reached among Middle East and North African Muslim countries, and the Southern Alliance becomes a reality.
Around the world new believers are forming study groups to learn about their newly discovered faith. There are no Bible experts who remain on earth, so they must read online books and try to learn as fast as they can. But they find the task is not easy, since there are many books, but most books about the future were written by people who were not very accurate. So the task of finding useful information was difficult.
One group in Texas has been searching for answers and assembles almost daily for a group study.  They have found that most of the detailed information about the Antichrist comes from Daniel Chapter 7, and the multiple heads, horns, and crowns on this Antichrist discussed in Revelation relate back to Daniel's prophecies.
The group leader James Coldwell tells those who are gathered:
"We are picking up where we left off last time with the Book of Daniel which describes four different beasts which look like various animals including a lion, a bear, a leopard, and a ten horned beast. The various beasts represent the four great empires of the ancient world, namely Chaldea (Nebuchadnezzar), Persia (Cyrus the Great), Macedonia (Alexander the Great), and Rome (the Caesars). We pick up the passage in Daniel at the discussion of the fourth beast, the Roman Empire. Let me read from Daniel Chapter 7":
Daniel 7:7 “After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast— terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.”
Group Leader Coldwell continues: "Daniel prophesied about the coming of the Roman Empire 500 years before Julius Caesar. Daniel foresaw how Rome would become a great empire through conquests on a scale unequaled in human history. Daniel also foresaw that Rome would be made up of ten major nations/regions it would conquer, and these ten are part of what is now Western Europe, North Africa, Greece, and part of Asia Minor. So the fourth beast described by Daniel is ancient Rome during the Caesars. It conquered the world, devouring many nations and peoples. It had ten horns, meaning ten regions as defined in ancient times."
"Now Daniel's vision turns to the Tribulation, when an empire ruled by the Antichrist will come out of the nations which were part of the ancient Roman Empire. Now to the New Testament, we see there are numerous references to the Antichrist. Daniel describes how the Antichrist as ruler of this Revived Roman Empire will consolidate his power:
Daniel 7:8 “While I was thinking about the horns [ancient nations], there before me was another horn, a little one [Antichrist], which came up among them [nations during the Tribulation]; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully.”
Daniel 7:23 “He gave me this explanation...24 The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom [ancient Rome]. After them another [11th] king will arise [Antichrist], different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings [European nations]. 25 He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people [Jews] and try to change the set times [prophecies about the Tribulation] and the laws [totally lawless]. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time [3 ½ years].”
Group Leader Coldwell: "This is describing the Antichrist. Let me read from the book "The Future Times" which we all have been reading which interprets these Bible passages:"
"This “little horn” is the Antichrist who during the first 3 ½ years of the Tribulation will conquer (“uproot”) three of the ten large “horns” (nations) and the other seven “horns” (nations) will submit to his rule as the King of the West during the Tribulation.  He will come from an 11th  nation which was apparently related to but possibly not part of the ancient Roman Empire.  This confederation of nations under the Antichrist will  become the Revived Roman Empire of the second half of the Tribulation, which is consolidated from ten separate nations by warfare and treaty during the first half of the Tribulation.  This also relates back to the first Seal, the Rider on the White Horse (dictatorship), and the second Seal, the Fiery Red Horse (worldwide warfare).  So the Antichrist consolidates power by warfare during the first half of the Tribulation setting up his evil tyrannical rule over a ten nation confederation made up of former Roman Empire countries and uses his accumulated power as a tool of Satan during the last part of the Tribulation.  He will then attempt to conquer the rest of the world as his predecessors the Caesars had done.  He will do Satan's work as he tries to destroy Israel and all Jews everywhere during the last 3 ½ years of the Tribulation (the meaning of “time, times, and half a time” – 1 year plus 2 years plus ½ year = 3 ½ years).
The passages from Daniel describe the Antichrist and his origins several thousand years before he actually arrives.  Daniel says the Antichrist will rule western nations which were formerly part of the ancient Roman Empire, so his empire is not made up of Islamic nations or other regions.  Those regions will have their own power spheres and will also be pulled together by Satan into his evil plans.  More will be discussed about the origins of the Antichrist in Revelation Chapter 17."
A member of the study group asks: "How many here believe that President Antivon is the Antichrist?" Everyone talks at once, with most saying they believe he is, some saying they are not sure, and a few saying they do not believe he could come out of the US. But all agree that Antivon is anti-Christian. "He does not believe in God, but believes he is a god!" one member interjects. Another asks "How can we really know?"
Group Leader Coldwell tries to answer the questions: "The Antichrist has some of the traits of the various nations and rulers of the ancient world – a mixture of speed, strength and cunning -- but he will be different. Satan will empower him directly, making him one of the most powerful dictators in history. The Antichrist is discussed in a number of Bible passages and is referred to by several names. Although the term “antichrist” has stuck as the name commonly used for him, the Bible calls him “the Beast”, “the Beast out of the Sea”, “the antichrist”, “the man of sin”, “the little horn”, “the man of lawlessness”, “the man doomed to destruction”, and “the lawless one” as noted in the following representative passages:
2 Thessalonians 2:3 -- “Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. 4 He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God.”
2 Thessalonians 2:8 -- “And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.”
1  John 2:18 -- “Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist
is coming, even now many antichrists have come.” Revelation 13:2 “The beast I saw resembled a leopard”
Daniel 7:8 – “While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one...”
Then Group Leader Coldwell reads from "The Future Times":
"The rise of the Antichrist will be orchestrated by Satan with a dramatic flair which builds him up as a deity and therefore an object of worship in the eyes of the world. But his worshipers will actually be worshiping Satan.
Revelation 13:3 “One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast. 4 People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, “Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?”
The Bible predicts that the Antichrist will survive a “fatal wound” received during an assassination attempt since a “sword” is used against him (Revelation 13:14).  He will appear to actually die, but will be revived and live when everyone on earth thought he was dead.  This near-death experience will cement his “deity” image and help promote him as head of the new religious order sponsored by Satan.  People of all nations will see his Satan-induced power and will witness his “resurrection” from the dead, then will worship Satan through the Antichrist.  The two will be practically indistinguishable.  This worldwide adoration mixed with his presumed “miraculous resurrection” leads to the Antichrist setting up his own religion where he is the deity, and he places his own statue in the temple in Jerusalem to be worshiped as an idol (the Abomination of Desolation).  Satan is such a copy-cat, and this becomes one reason why this man is called the antichrist, because Satan uses him to mimic and mock the true salvation work and person of Jesus Christ, including Christ's miracles, death and resurrection.  As we noted earlier, when the Jewish believers in Israel see the Antichrist idol statue called the Abomination of Desolation put into the temple in Jerusalem they must flee to the high desert areas of Jordan where they will be protected, or they will be killed.
The Antichrist will be a genius, so we must give him his due. He will accomplish many things due to his combination of great intellect, communication skills, military genius, political skills, and even his use of false religion and idolatry to accomplish the will of his benefactor, Satan. Satan uses the man's innate skills, which will be numerous, and adds his own empowerment through demon possession and even Satan possession at times to make the Antichrist into a rock star level superhero world leader in the eyes of the degenerate unbelievers of the world.  World events will also lure people into a desire for a strongman to solve the world's problems resulting from the “Four Horsemen” judgments of Revelation 6. He even uses false miracles to wow the masses, which will be discussed later. So his rise to power is swift and decisive, and he becomes the world's most famous and popular man and the public will literally worship him as a deity. But his precipitous fall 3 ½ years later will mirror his meteoric rise.
The following passages in the Bible describe the Antichrist's significant capabilities:
1)  Political skill – pulls together many (Revelation 13:1; Daniel 7: 20-21); 2) Military skill (Revelation 13:1; Daniel 7: 20-21; Revelation 16), 3) Religious skill – sets up false religion which deceives the masses (Revelation 13:6-8, Revelation 17+18), 4) Power of miracles (2 Thessalonians 2:1-12), 5) eloquent communicator. Again, demon and Satan possession will enhance his innate skills to levels where people will see him as a god— but only for a short time.
The key to the success of the Antichrist is his ability to put in place a system of evil power which takes away individual freedom, especially freedom to worship anyone except himself, in exchange for the promise of security and economic benefit. The Tribulation will be a time of heightened insecurity for people due to the disruption of the Rapture, followed by extreme levels of disaster from the Four Horsemen and extreme natural disasters which we have already noted. Therefore, people will be ready to accept this dictator since he appears to have great power on several levels, and promises the masses he will keep them safe and secure. Of course, that will turn out to be a false promise of security, and they will lose their freedoms in exchange for nothing.
Revelation 13:5 “The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months.”
Satan gives the Antichrist supernatural communication ability to issue false promises in a manner which makes them widely accepted as truth. Add to that his arrogant and blasphemous tone, and the degenerate world will view him with awe and reverence, and will refuse to turn to the true Savior Jesus Christ. His short-lived power will last for 3 ½ years until the Second Advent of Christ. Revelation 13:6 “It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven.”
The Antichrist sets himself up as a deity and continually blasphemes God and all associated with God, in Heaven and on earth. His taunting of God will make him a hero to the degenerate masses, who will adore him.  He turns his statues into idols to be worshiped. He slanders God and the elect angels in Heaven because he cannot stand anyone having more power than he has, especially those beyond his reach to intimidate or harass. His absolute arrogance will further endear him to his adoring fans. They will think in their own arrogance that God must be powerless against him, since at first there does not appear to be any retribution against him. But God will only give him 3 ½ years, then it will all end. He will soon become the very first resident of the Lake of Fire, the eternal residence waiting for Satan, fallen angels, and unbelievers of all time. Revelation 13:7 “It was given power to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation.”
After reading from the book, Group Leader Coldwell continues:
"The Antichrist will make a treaty with Israel during the early part of the Tribulation, then will break that treaty and occupy Israel without much resistance and install a puppet ruler over Israel who supports him.  By the middle of the Tribulation the Antichrist will have a significant military presence in Israel, setting up a military target for the other three Kings to come after him at the end of the Tribulation resulting in the final battle at Armageddon.  In the meantime, the Antichrist will exert great power over Israel, including military power, and also power over economic life and even power over life and death, but these powers will not cause Jewish believers to renounce their faith in Christ. This will severely frustrate the Antichrist.  God permits persecution of believers in Israel to show His power through believers in the face of absolute evil. The Antichrist will have extreme power over many of the people of the world, and he will be one of the most powerful people of all time, humanly speaking. But he cannot control God's faithful believers, even though he will kill many of them for their refusal to comply with his system of evil. It should be noted that all believers in Israel will have fled to the mountains of Jordan before the Antichrist takes firm control of Israel, so the Jewish believers who will be in Israel during the second half of the Tribulation are recent converts. When we see their faith and martyrdom, we must remember what very new believers they are, and how impressive their display of faith will be under the circumstances."
Revelation 13:8 “All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.”
A member of the study group asks: "Why would people chose to follow the Antichrist?"
Group Leader Coldwell:
Unbelievers on earth believe in the Antichrist instead of believing in Jesus Christ. They will prefer Satan's lie to the Truth. Worshiping the Antichrist will be satanic worship, since it is Satan's power they are seeing. This “hardness of heart” will be extreme among the degenerate masses during the Tribulation. The Antichrist will also make life difficult for those who refuse to follow him. He will institute a "Mark of the Beast" program which will prohibit anyone from buying or selling anything, including food, without accepting this Mark. But as believers we are told we must refuse the Mark. It will be difficult to refuse as we look at our families and others who depend on us. But refuse we must. The Bible says we must be faithful and endure patiently:"
Revelation 13:9 “Whoever has ears, let them hear. 10 “If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity they will go.  If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword they will be killed.”  This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God’s people.”
"As noted, these will be new believers who become martyrs, none for more than a few years because the Rapture removed all believers before the Tribulation began. For Jewish believers in Israel it will be even more difficult. At mid-Tribulation all believers in Israel must flee to a safe hiding place in the mountains. After that flight, all new believers from that point on are required to remain and be prepared to fight when the time comes. Those who sacrifice for the Lord during this extreme time of evil will receive their reward in Heaven. God allows evil to have its way for short periods of time throughout history, but God never loses control. The Antichrist will kill many believers, either directly or indirectly by taking away their ability to buy basic necessities since they will refuse the Mark of the Beast. But the murderers are destined for much misery on earth during the Trumpet and Bowl Judgments followed by eternal condemnation."
After a prayer for guidance the study group members depart. They will be back again the next day seeking more wisdom from the Scriptures.
CHAPTER 6
THE FALSE PROPHET

In Israel, recently elected Prime Minister Hamon Garlock has been following news of the rise of President Antivon very closely. He views him as a fellow traveler on the road to a radical progressive future. Garlock is an atheist who rose to power in a bitter political struggle, and would not have won except that his opponent -- who was expected to win easily -- died in a freak accident just before the election.  Garlock is another of Satan's men who had recently and unexpectedly come to the forefront as a world leader under highly unusual circumstances. The Bible calls him the "Beast out of the Land" (Israel), and also the "False Prophet," because he will support the Antichrist and promote his idolatry to the Jews. Garlock decides to make a treaty with the Antichrist very early during the Tribulation which will allow the army of the Antichrist to station military forces inside Israel in return for certain advantages for Israel, and at the expense of the Arab nations. Prime Minister Garlock flies to the US to meet with President Antivon and finalize the proposed treaty. The two leaders meet at Camp David to discuss the remaining details. After two days of discussions, they reach an agreement.
Prime Minister Garlock: "This Treaty between the US and Israel is a necessity because of the recent attempted invasion by Russia. US troops will be stationed in Israel to prevent any future attacks. It is also important to us that the Treaty allows Israel to fully occupy the Temple Mount where the new Temple has been built, because the religious Jews demand it, and they also want to resume animal sacrifices. I need to gain their support since they were strongly opposed to my election as Prime Minister. So with these provisions already in the Treaty as we have agreed, I am very satisfied and ready to sign."
President Antivon: "Then we are in agreement. The Arab nations will not like it, but I will deal with them. Let us make a public announcement today that we have a Treaty."
Prime Minister Garlock: "I agree. And although the Treaty does not include the "religious" support you want from me, you can be assured that I am strongly committed to supporting your priorities as we have discussed privately. But the rest of my Cabinet does not need to know about that."
News of the Treaty between the Western Alliance and Israel spreads quickly, and most in Israel are generally positive since they view it as protection of Israel by the world's most powerful Alliance. But not all agree. One reporter seeks out Rabbi Cohen from northern Israel who recently converted to Christianity and is an outspoken critic of Prime Minister Garlock.
Reporter: "Rabbi Cohen, what is your take on the Treaty?"
Rabbi Cohen: "This is the Treaty between the Antichrist and the False Prophet discussed in the Bible.  Revelation 13:11 says “Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.”  The Beast out of the Land, not "earth," means the False Prophet is from Israel, often referred to in the Bible as “the Land."  “Beast” means they are both demon possessed and serve the “dragon” Satan.  This man is known to us as the False Prophet since his primary role is as the religious supporter of the Antichrist, promoting him as a deity.  So the False Prophet, even though he is an atheist, has a "religious" side to him, promoting a false satanic religion through mysticism and idolatry.  He is doing Satan's work, just like the Antichrist, which is why this verse says he “spoke like a dragon.” Horns in the Bible refer to power, and the False Prophet's “two horns” show he wields his own power as ruler of Israel and is also a powerful religious leader supporting the Antichrist.  The False Prophet will also be the one who puts the idol statue of the Antichrist into the Temple in Jerusalem at the midpoint of the Tribulation.  The Jewish leader is called the False Prophet since he will support the Antichrist in promoting his satanic false religion.  The Antichrist will use a treaty to make the False Prophet his puppet to aid in spreading his evil religious system throughout Israel.  The Antichrist will show his antisemitism later, but for now it suits his needs to work with this False Prophet and with Israel, especially to absorb the apostate remnants of religious Judaism into his own satanic religious system.  While this is happening, many Jews are turning to Jesus Christ recognizing Him as their Messiah Savior.
Reporter: "So you think Prime Minister Garlock is the False Prophet who supports the Antichrist who you say is President Antivon? Are you serious?"
Rabbi Cohen: "Yes, very serious.  The False Prophet is referred to in several ways throughout the Bible: 1) False Prophet (Matthew 24:24; Revelation 19:20); 2) Beast out of the land (Revelation 13:11-18); and 3) Dan the Serpent (Genesis 49:16-18)."
"And Revelation 13:12 says “It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been  healed. 13 And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people. 14 Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.”
"So this verse says there will be some sort of "false resurrection" of the Antichrist, although we do not yet know what that means. I would expect that we will soon find out.
"The False Prophet's alliance with the Antichrist is two-fold, both as puppet ruler in Israel and as a religious leader, and he will exercise full authority on behalf of the Antichrist. The False Prophet will perform pseudo miracles under the power of demons, including as it says here “causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth”. The two Beasts work together to do Satan's work in establishing and promoting the worldwide false religious system where the Antichrist is the deity and the False Prophet is his number one prophet and keeper of the false religion. Again we see how Satan tries to mimic God's truth by substituting falsehood to deceive the masses. The near-death and false resurrection of the Antichrist will be used by the False Prophet as a marketing tool to promote him to the masses as a deity, which is why the Abomination of Desolation idol – a statue of the Antichrist -- is set up in the temple in Jerusalem at the direction of the False Prophet. This idol statue of the Antichrist was described by Daniel:
Daniel 9:27 -- “He [Antichrist] will confirm a covenant with many [Israel] for one ‘seven’ [Tribulation 7 years]. In the middle of the ‘seven’ he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end [Second Advent] that is decreed is poured out on him.”
Rabbi Cohen concludes: "Therefore the False Prophet is a tool of the Antichrist to promote him as a god to the unbelievers of Israel. Many will be deceived because of the pseudo- miracles the Antichrist appears to perform, along with the message of healing the earth and eliminating the undesirables. And the False Prophet will be the one who sells these lies to the people of Israel."
The Reporter goes away shaking his head.
CHAPTER 7
ANTICHRIST AND FALSE RELIGION

At the White House the staff is scurrying as President Antivon decides to go out for dinner to his favorite restaurant. He has not been able to do so since becoming President. As he arrives at the restaurant and begins walking up the sidewalk he is targeted for assassination. A knife- wielding attacker bursts out of the crowd yelling "Die, Antichrist" and manages to stab President Antivon in the chest. The attacker is immediately killed by Secret Service agents.
President Antivon is rushed to George Washington University Hospital, and after attempts to revive him is declared dead. The sheet is pulled up over him as the Chief Medical Officer goes to the briefing room and begins to tell the nation that President Antivon has been killed. The Press outside is also notified, and the news spreads quickly. As the briefing continues an Aide comes into the room where the body is laying and sees movement. As he begins yelling, the doctors are urgently called back and President Antivon is found to be alive and is revived.
After several minutes of the world thinking President Antivon is dead, news that he is alive creates euphoric celebrations worldwide. Rumors spread of a "resurrection" from the dead, slowly at first, then a frenzy of press activity declares it is a "miracle" and "a sign of our impending salvation." President Antivon instantly gains a god-like stature among his loyal followers. News announcers declare "He is the One we have been waiting for to deliver us, and to deliver the earth. He is indeed a god among us."
Crowds in Times Square go from sobbing to cheering wildly at the news of the "resurrection" of President Antivon. Everyone heard what they wanted to hear. Climate change will finally be resolved by this god-like man who can even cheat death. The world believes it has a new savior who will end climate change, implement world peace and provide prosperity under a new world order, and stop the spread of what they view as "Christian moralism."
After a short recovery, President Antivon quickly acts to consolidate even more power. The military will now be used to enforce the new laws requiring compliance with his climate priorities. Christians must be controlled, stopped or eliminated entirely. The internal police must be expanded. Most citizens, but not all, cheer and celebrate the new stronger initiatives.
At the Capitol Building Senators talk among themselves about the drastic changes being made by President Antivon without consent of Congress:
Senator Anders:  "The changes being made are unconstitutional and frightening.  I am not on board with this shredding of our Constitution.  We lost 16 Senators to the Vanishment and they were ones who would have helped stop this madness.  But they are not here to help, and the replacement process is uncertain and has stalled.  What are we going to do?"
Senator Farrow: "Who would have thought that it was the Christians who have vanished who were holding the country together? They were the core of the good and decent people who believed in the principles our country was founded on. As long as they were here this sudden degradation of society could not have happened, but now that they are gone the majority of those who remain are ready to accept the radical leftist and anti-Constitutional policies of President Antivon. He is lawless, but what can be done? The citizens who would have stood in the way are gone."
Senator Davis: "President Antivon's measures have declared lawful people criminals, and criminals are now celebrated as heroes. After the former Christians vanished, the new Christians were declared to be enemies of the State. President Antivon is trampling the rights of all good and decent citizens, especially these new Christians."
Senator Ford: "There are rumblings that the new President is the one called the Antichrist. I now believe it myself. Something must be done or he will lead us straight to Armageddon."
Senator Davis: "No wonder he hates Christians so much. Although I had never believed it before, the Bible says there would be a man like this. He is mad, and is lawlessly implementing his madness. We must stop him from further shredding the Constitution or he will destroy our country. But the masses are swayed by his soaring rhetoric and lies. We need to meet tomorrow and discuss details, but we must be very discreet." They all agree to meet the following day at a secret location.
Later that day, the four Senators are arrested and charged with treason.
The next day President Antivon addresses the nation:
"Today I am furthering my previous Declaration of Martial Law and expanding on the National State of Emergency to focus on combating global climate change. If we do not fight global climate change, my advisers say the earth will not survive even seven more years. This is the real global war which is necessary. Those who do not believe and join will be shunned. This includes primarily the new Christians who are climate change deniers, and also do not believe in LGBTQI propositions, gender choice, or other progressive ideas. Those who do not renounce such hate must be dealt with harshly. I am implementing a system which will only allow those who join our fight to buy and sell in commerce. Anyone who is not with us is against us, and especially the Christians if they refuse to renounce their backward and hate- filled beliefs."
Watching President Antivon in his conference room in Silicon Valley the CEO of a social media giant says to his staff who have gathered to see what President Antivon would say: "This is the opportunity we have been hoping for. We will muster all of our power to support the President's initiatives. Make sure all employees know that our priority is to save the world, and to do it we will do whatever is necessary to support President Antivon's policies. The Martial Law and emergency order will help cut through all the red tape. We need to get on this fast, so let's get to work and change the world."
In the streets many celebrate President Antivon's initiatives. Each one hears what they want to hear from his speech. Many think they will personally benefit since Christians will be forced to "convert" to the new way of the State. A leader of the assembled crowd is heard saying: "The ones who vanished needed to go. They stood in the way of the progressive society and the healing of the earth. With them gone, we can now move ahead into a future filled with great promise, and without all the other things those Christians perpetrated on society." And the prospect of taxing wealth from the new Christians who are being declared outcasts and will soon be dispatched in large numbers also helps deepen their admiration for President Antivon. The average person sees him as the one they have been waiting for. To them he is a savior. He is a god.
But elsewhere there is opposition to the power seizure of President Antivon. New believers see him for what he is. He is the Antichrist discussed in the Bible. He is the one who will bring only satanic influence and destruction. Believers meeting in secret all over the country commit to opposing the Antichrist. They know the Mark of the Beast is coming. They know this man will lead them to Armageddon. They know they must oppose him and trust in God to deliver them. But they also know it will be a hard road to travel. Secret internet groups are set up to support the pockets of believers in the US and elsewhere. But they must be very careful. They realize the forces of the Antichrist will seek them out to shut them down and eventually will try to destroy them.
CHAPTER 8
THE JEWISH AWAKENING

Scene in Israel at a Synagogue in Jerusalem:
Rabbi Cohen of northern Israel is visiting Jerusalem to address worshipers: "My friends, we Jews were wrong. We missed our Messiah. He has come, and we missed it. He is Jesus, the One our Christian friends worship, and we missed His coming to us. [Many start to leave the Synagogue, but many others stay.] It is time to change our way of thinking and accept Jesus as our Savior. He was the One the Torah and Prophets spoke of. He was the One who will return for His believers in just seven short years. Inside the Temples in Israel the apostate Jews who still refuse to believe in their Messiah have re-instituted animal sacrifices. That is a blasphemy to the Lord! The Lord Jesus Christ was the only sacrifice, and ended the animal sacrifices. Our rituals and animal sacrifices are not sanctioned by God since the true sacrifice which they formerly represented has already been accomplished on the Cross. As the Book of Hebrews says about such sacrifices after the Cross: "they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace." It is time to shed the apostasy which modern day Judaism has become. The time is short. Prepare the way for the Lord!"
Later, outside the Temple in Jerusalem:
The young man Shem Kolb is with his friends, now a large crowd, who had gone out to the mountains to see the remnants of the Russian forces which had been destroyed. They are discussing what Shem had learned from his Christian friend before his friend disappeared: "Look at all the things which have happened already. The Christian Bible has been shown to be correct about what would happen at the Rapture and in the time following. My Christian friend, who disappeared at the Rapture event, told me of these things. They were all correct. The Rabbi who has become a new believer is also correct. We Jews were on the wrong side of history. Now we are required to prepare the way for the Lord's return. There will be much to overcome. But we are the core group of new believers who will declare the gospel of Jesus Christ to the lost world."
A member of the group asks him "What must we do to become the 144,000 evangelists?  We have just recently become believers ourselves.  How do we accomplish this overwhelming task?"
Shem Kolb: I have been studying this issue intensely since the Vanishment event occurred.  I have found that things will unfold in two stages over seven years.  The Bible says that during the first 3 1/2 years there will be increasing disasters and persecution of believers.  After the first 3 1/2 years the Jewish believers in Israel must be ready to flee to the mountains outside of Israel when the statue of the Antichrist is put in the temple.  Those believer Jews who flee Israel must remain in hiding to become the core group to repopulate the world during the 1000 year reign of the Lord, called the Millennium.  While those believer Jews remain in the mountains during the second 3 1/2 years of the Tribulation, those Jews who become believers after the Midpoint must remain and train to fight the Antichrist's military forces.  There are therefore two very different sets of instructions, and each group must follow the instructions meant for them.  I have been studying a book that explains it all, called "The Future Times" which lays out the timeline of what will happen.  Here is what it says about this issue:"
"When the Rapture takes all believers off the earth, no qualified evangelists remain. Therefore God raises up a new cadre of evangelists at the beginning of the Tribulation, which are the 144,000 witnesses from Israel.  The 144,000 are Jews who believe in Christ as soon as they see the Rapture, since they will immediately grasp its significance and understand what it means.  The Rapture causes a great awakening on the earth among the Jews.  Almost immediately after the Rapture the 144,000 Jews believe in Jesus Christ and become the initial evangelists for the early part of the Tribulation.  Therefore the elect angels in charge of the weather judgments are told to hold off on disasters until evangelism gets established since God wants to offer every chance for salvation.  These new evangelists will have “the seal of the living God” which means they are given special divine protection.  The Holy Spirit will have departed from the earth, and since His sealing ministry is gone, a new form of divine sealing is given  to these 144,000 evangelists.  The great weather disasters will not begin until these 144,000 are in place and sealed, and the evangelization of the world has begun."
Shem and his friends agree that they want to be part of the initial 144,000 believer Jews who will carry the Word of the Lord to Israel and the entire world.  They declare their faith in their Messiah Jesus Christ and pledge their lives to the cause of evangelizing the world.
As they set out on their mission they know that their path will be a difficult one.
CHAPTER 9
ECONOMIC DISASTER -- THE HORSEMEN RIDE

Back in LA, news anchor Jill Steiner cannot sleep and is up early reading from the book "The Future Times:"
"The third horseman now appears, which is economic disaster.
Revelation 6:5 “When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. 6 “Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, “Two pounds of wheat for a day’s wages, and six pounds of barley for a day’s wages, and do not damage the oil and the wine!” ”
Economic depression and resultant famine is the Black Horse. As a result of the first two horses, the world spirals quickly into worldwide depression. Scarcity and famine will grip the entire world for the remainder of the Tribulation. The scales show how precious food becomes during this intense global economic depression. The Antichrist will parcel out food, goods, and services to his followers and withhold them from those who refuse to submit to him by taking his Mark of the Beast.
The Lord is heard saying here that a day's wages will only buy a quart of wheat grains, or three quarts of barley grains, barely enough for a family to survive on lower quality food, and with nothing left over for anything else. And the olive oil and wine (luxury foods during a depression) will be highly sought after by those fortunate few who can afford them. Life is reduced to a subsistence level with people living hand to mouth worldwide."
Having lost track of time, Jill stops reading and hurries off to work. In the studio she starts her morning news report:
"Good morning LA.  Or is it?  Food shortages have become widespread and food riots are occurring everywhere.  We take you now to downtown LA where this video shows armed bands of looters in various parts of the city."  As the video plays, Jill talks with her producer. She tells him this is due to the onerous restrictions put in place by President Antivon.  The producer tells Jill to be very careful about what she says, because there are eyes everywhere watching for anyone questioning President Antivon's policies.  Jill agrees that these are dangerous times to have an opinion.  But in the final moments of her morning news show Jill looks at the clock and sees she needs to fill 15 seconds before the next show starts.  Jill looks at the camera and says "Am I the only one who looks at all of these disasters and sees the predictions from the Book of Revelation?  Do you see it?  I think we should all take a look at what the Bible has predicted about the Future Times.  That is the way I see it."  As the show ends her producer warns: "Jill, be very careful.  The authorities can shut us down any time they chose to do so."
Later that day, President Antivon institutes new measures, taking even more power to himself. Congress has now become just a shadow government organization, and with Martial Law and a State of Emergency in effect the Supreme Court is hamstrung. Anyone questioning the actions of President Antivon winds up fired, imprisoned or found dead.
At home that evening Jill Steiner, with the words of her producer still ringing in her ears, continues to read from the book "The Future Times."
"Now the Lord opens the 4th Seal, the Pale Horse of Death, announced by the fourth Seraph.
Revelation 6:7 “When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” 8 I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.”
Death is the fourth horsemen, naturally resulting from the first three. Survival during the Tribulation is difficult, with the previous three horsemen causing death on a massive scale. A large part of the earth's population will die during these seven years from war, famine, wild animals, and increased illnesses, and many others will die from specific judgments during the Bowl and Trumpet judgments.  The Pale Horse alone will take 25% of the earth's population, over 1.5 billion people.  Then other judgments in the later Seals will kill even more people so that from the start of the Tribulation until the end it appears that more than 90% of the earth's population will die."
As Jill puts down her book she contemplates the words "more than 90% of the earth's population will die."  After a rough mental calculation Jill says out loud "that is many billions of people!"  Of the people she sees on a daily basis only 1 in 10 will live out another seven years?  She shudders as she looks at the book lying on her table, the words echoing in her head.  Somehow she knows it is true.
Trying to think of other things, Jill makes a mental note not to incite the authorities to investigate her co-workers. She does not want to put them at risk. The authorities have threatened to destroy the lives of any who oppose them. It is not just her life, it is the lives of all who depend on her doing what the authorities require. The news has become just a propaganda machine for the authorities. But what is right? Jill goes to sleep wondering how she can continue to ignore speaking openly about what she has come to believe as the truth. But she is conflicted by the need to support her friends and co-workers. She finds no easy answers, only more questions.
Jill decides to go out and meet with several of her friends. They have been asking, but she has repeatedly declined. It had been several months since they last went out together, so they agree to meet at a bistro near Jill's apartment. Once there, they catch up on what they have been doing, their careers, and so on. Then the talk turns to politics. It could not be avoided in the current climate.
Jill's friend Tara asks: "So Jill, where do you stand on the new President? Do you think he is really a god or something?"
Jill: "Oh, I don't think much about it. But it seems a bit of a stretch to me."
Tara: "But he was resurrected, right? I mean, he died and then he came back to life. That is something god-like, right?"
Jill: "Technically not resurrected. That is what people believe happens at -- well -- the Rapture which supposedly just happened. Or maybe it was just a Vanishment. I don't know. But being dead and then revived is something else. Maybe resuscitation would be a better word."
Tara: "The rest of us were talking before you arrived. We all believe he is some kind of a god or something. It is so cool, and he will have power from the Harmonics of the Universe to heal the planet. It is all so exiting! We can live out our lives now on a healed earth, instead of dying from the rising oceans and heat and stuff. I mean, only a "denier" would oppose our President."
Jill: "Whatever you want to believe. I simply have my doubts."
Tara: "But we believe it. So we don't know why you wouldn't believe it, too. It is obvious to the rest of us. Why can't you see what we see? We thought you were our friend."
Jill: "OK, so you believe it. Fine. Let's just skip it."
Tara: "That is not the point. This is one of the most important issues of our time. We now have a man with god-like powers who can solve the problems of the earth and also make our lives better all-around -- we don't see how you could miss it. I mean, that is really weird of you. This is a salvation we can actually put into practical use. Don't you believe in it?"
Jill: "Salvation of the world by him? I doubt that. We hardly know anything about our new President, yet you already believe he has supernatural powers to solve the problems of the world? Count me out of this little fantasy. I have a headache. I'll be leaving now. Bye."
Jill's friends shake their heads and whisper to each other as Jill quickly departs.
Back at her apartment Jill thinks about how she has always been very compatible with these friends. She has known them for years. Now she is seen as "weird" by them. It was a change for Jill because she was always seen as being among the "in crowd." She was always smart and pretty and cool. She thought about the new pressures which had developed, and what that would mean to people. Jill is beginning to understand how people are being driven apart by the new politics. She wondered if she really was weird, as Tara had said. "Too much thinking" she thought. "I really do have a headache now. I need some sleep."
As she awakens the next morning Jill turns on the market news. The anchors are grim as they discuss the worldwide famine which has already killed millions of people. The video footage from Africa, India and South America is depressing. The food chain has been completely disrupted and the most vulnerable are dying in droves. Those who do not die from starvation are killed by the gangs of thugs who steal their remaining food. There has been almost no rain anywhere on earth for months. The heat is oppressive and bakes the already scorched earth. The seed planted last Spring failed to sprout in many areas or the world. It will be a long, hot summer. Jill changes the channel. Re-runs of "I Love Lucy" give a short respite from the endless bad news. It is the episode where Lucy works in a chocolate factory and the conveyor belt goes haywire. Oh, for the days when we could enjoy such frivolous things. But the reality is far too depressing and grim. She heads off to work dreading the breaking news she will need to deliver. And with good reason.
CHAPTER 10
WORLD-WIDE WAR

At the European Office of the Western Alliance President Antivon is meeting with Alliance staff members and military advisers. "It is time to bring more nations into our Alliance. We have been trying to negotiate with many of them, but that has proved fruitless. We have no option but to take them over by force." The next day the Western Alliance declares war on several neighboring countries which are not currently part of the Alliance.
President Antivon masses his coalition armies in preparation for a military offensive on multiple fronts.  His 11 nation confederation has control of the military forces of the US and EU, making it the largest military force on earth, double the size of any other.  Having already consolidated his control over the 11 nation confederation, he turns his focus to attacking nations on the borders of the Western Alliance.  They fall quickly and easily, one after another until his empire includes all of North and South America, and all of Europe and parts of south Asia.  It also expands to include nations which border Russia and the Middle East.  He has his eyes on Africa next.  The Russian and Chinese alliances, having been alarmed by the Western Alliance aggression, are worried -- and with good reason.  President Antivon has made it clear that he will institute a New Worldwide Order with himself as Supreme Leader.  His stature as a god has grown among the people along with his successes.  After a successful invasion, the first thing which appears in that conquered country is a statue of President Antivon.  A god must have a statue to be worshiped.
Over a period of months, country after country falls in rapid succession.  The wars are bloody as nations resist.  Millions of people are killed.  In just eight months the Western Alliance has expanded to 9 more countries.  The death toll stands at 28 million in just 18 months from these wars, and that number is still rising.
With his control over the Western Alliance established, the Vatican has refused to submit their own independent authority to President Antivon whose hatred for Christianity runs deep. President Antivon is present as his forces storm the Vatican with armed joint troops, which quickly overwhelm the Swiss Guards. President Antivon makes his way into the Vatican inner chamber and comes to where the former Pope's Chief of Staff, or Camerlengo, is sitting, acting as an interim Pope in certain respects due to the chaos after the Vanishment, the previous Pope and potential successors having gone in the Vanishment. Antivon knocks the Camerlengo's hat off and says "Get out." The chief aide tries to intervene and is shot dead.
Antivon: "Now Popey, or whatever you think you are, get out. This is not your place any more. I am the one who has come to save the world. I am the one they have been waiting for."
Camerlengo: "You blasphemer. You will die in hell." He is shot dead by President Antivon's security forces.
The Vatican staff members are rounded up and escorted out. President Antivon sits down on the Pope's Throne. "This fits me well. A god is now on this Throne, not a man in a funny hat. I am renaming Vatican City as "Babylon" in honor of that great ancient city. Now let's really change the world."
Before Antivon departs, he appoints a trusted "Ambassador to Rome" to run the world-wide religious system from Babylon with Antivon as its god. He tells his new man in Babylon: "You must ensure that I am seen as a god, and worshiped as a god. You must not fail me. This is very important to me, and I would take any failure personally. Understood?"  The Ambassador replies, "Understood, I will not fail you." Antivon: "Good, see to it that the Christians pay dearly for refusing to worship me." Antivon departs, and the Vatican infrastructure is turned from Christian to promoting Antivon as a god. It seemed brilliant to take over an existing infrastructure rather than build one from scratch. The new system in Babylon was up and running within a week, dominating social media with Antivon's propaganda.
The remaining alliances of countries outside the Western Alliance have now consolidated into the Russian Alliance, the China Alliance, and the Southern Alliance made up of Muslim countries in the Middle East and North Africa. These Alliances all formed as a reaction to the expansion of the Western Alliance, and many former enemy nations are now in alliances in opposition to the Western Alliance. The stage is set for a full-scale world war.
For those nations not in alliances, regional conflicts which have been brewing for a long time erupt into open warfare. There is no world order on which they depend, so they proceed to engage their long-time enemies over age-old disputes in open warfare. The bloodshed is extreme as these long-held hatreds play out in barbaric ways. Without a system of law, order, and justice in these formerly Third World countries, their people are becoming little more than savages. Justice is no longer a term they understand. Gangs of armed thugs rule local regions as vengeance and domination become the primary goals. Murder becomes the primary reason for death, surpassing the famine. A new slave trade develops as these nations sell their enslaved enemies into the four world Alliances, which are eager to obtain them. The slave trade becomes one of the more lucrative businesses in the non-alliance countries.
At LANX Jill Steiner is reporting on the world on the brink of a world war. After discussing the Alliances which have been established in opposition to one another, she discusses the regional issues which have been going on for several months now:
Jill: "China has invaded Taiwan and taken it over. With no one to help them anymore, Taiwan was left defenseless. In south Asia, India and Pakistan have begun crossing into each other's territory and have engaged in several bloody conflicts.  The numbers of dead are growing daily. The African continent is not immune, and food wars among a number of African nations are ongoing. Iran has invaded Iraq again -- how many times has that happened now? Terrorists have become emboldened and are attacking at will. The world is in turmoil." Jill ends her broadcast with a sense of desperation. Those who promised peace and stability have instead resorted to senseless wars and despicable inhumanity.
It is now 1 year after the Vanishment.
CHAPTER 11
DEATH -- THE NEW NORMAL

Jill Steiner is riding the Metrorail returning from an interview, and is reading from her book.
"The Four Horsemen are now firmly in place. Millions have died as a result. Now, the 5th Seal introduces a different type of historical trend, which is persecution of believers, including martyrdom on a large scale. This Seal is not a divine judgment, but a “false judgment” caused by man upon God's Christian believers simply because of their faith. Only The Lord Jesus Christ has earned the right to judge, so this usurpation of His role by unqualified mankind will result in judgment of the murderers later during the Tribulation. Man's inhumanity to man will reach a peak during the Tribulation. So much for the continuous improvement of mankind, which is a myth.
Revelation 6:9 “When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained.”
Believers who hold firm to their faith will be persecuted and often killed during the Tribulation. Those who refuse to worship the Antichrist are hunted down and become martyrs. Since the Rapture removed all believers before the Tribulation began, all these believers will be relatively new to their faith. That makes this an impressive display of faith by these believers during this time of great persecution. And that is the purpose for God allowing martyrdom for a while, to serve as a witness to a hardened world of unbelievers so some may turn to Christ and believe as a result of this intense form of testimony.
Revelation 6:10 “They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?” 11 Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters, were killed just as they had been.”
The prayers of the martyrs are heard by the Lord, but they must be patient while God's plan plays out. Note that God has ordained that a “full number” of believers will be martyrs during the Tribulation, meaning a specific large number. As always, God has a time and manner decreed for the death of each of His own. But those who kill His believers will be severely judged. This persecution and killing of believers is one reason for the intensity of the disasters and judgments on the earth during this time, especially in the Trumpet and Bowl Judgments as will be noted later."
Jill is surprised by how the Bible would predict things so precisely.  Most non-legitimate sources would be very vague.  Especially about things 2000 years in the future.  But the Bible is specific.  That would lead one to believe it is sure about the results.  Jill reads on:
"Seal 6 is opened revealing massive earthquakes, enormous tidal waves/tsunamis and explosive volcanoes on a regular basis. This disruption of normal earthly events and processes will continue at intense levels throughout the remainder of the Tribulation.
Revelation 6:12 “I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,”
Soot from the earthquakes and resulting volcanoes will blacken the sky and hide the sun during the day and turn the moon red by night. Visibility will be greatly reduced. Airline travel will become nearly impossible in the thick ash. Everything will be coated with ash and will require constant cleaning, but will never stay clean. Constant irritation will be the companion of people on earth as they struggle to simply survive in the dust and ash-filled air. The beauty of the earth is stripped away as everything becomes covered by ash and dust. People must wear masks as they go about on daily tasks. Life is getting difficult, but it will get much worse.
Revelation 6:13 “and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind.”
Large meteors falling to earth will become a routine event. Life on earth will become shortened for many as with a fig tree shaken hard and its unripe fruit falling too early to be of any value (unbelievers with no salvation).
Revelation 6:14 “The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.”
Two issues are discussed here. First, the atmosphere being rolled up suggests nuclear warfare, and secondly there will be massive earthquakes which will shift the tectonic plates of the earth on a larger scale than ever before in the history of the earth. The landscape will change as a result. All island dwellers will die."
Jill shudders to read the words on the page. It is about millions of lives. Can it be true? Would God do such a thing? And why?
The next day LANX anchor Jill Steiner is at work anchoring her morning news show:
"Good morning.  This is day 380 after the Vanishment.  We can barely keep up with reporting the disasters and terrible events around the world which have resulted in many millions of deaths.  Today is no exception, and here is an overview of what has happened during the past 24 hours:
A massive volcano eruption in Indonesia and an enormous tsunami washed over numerous islands killing an estimated 100,000 people."
Jill barely pauses at that awful statistic before continuing...
"Earthquakes have become more frequent and very powerful in South America.  One earthquake in Uyuni, Bolivia this week measured 9.2 and caused the gigantic Uyuni Salt Flats to disappear, along with the city of Uyuni.  Over 30,000 people are presumed dead."
"Five new volcanoes have appeared in the Greek island chain near the Milos volcano. They created new islands and now dwarf the older volcanoes on the Greek Islands, having risen to double the height of any previous volcano on the Greek islands."
"A highly contagious and previously unknown virus is sweeping through Asia, and after killing over 25,000 people during the past couple weeks is now spreading quickly throughout the Pacific region."
"A massive meteor fell to earth in central Australia in the Red Centre region near Alice Springs.  The impact of the meteor had the energy of twenty nuclear bombs going off at the same time.  Alice Springs and 15 other towns were completely destroyed.  Over 35,000 perished."
"In Yellowstone Park, Wyoming, the Yellowstone Basin super-volcano, although it was essentially a flat volcano, has erupted explosively. The "Kill Zone" covered most of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. The resulting ash has created near-total darkness across several of the northern US states. Yellowstone Park has ceased to exist, along with numerous cities and towns in the Kill Zone. The death toll is expected to be enormous."
"Following the Yellowstone eruption many of the dormant Pacific Basin "Ring of Fire" volcanoes have also erupted explosively."
"War between India and Pakistan has led to the use of tactical nuclear weapons by both sides. Several cities in both countries have been hit and the status of the people there is unknown.
Communications in that part of the world have been severely disrupted by the electromagnetic effects of the nuclear detonations."
"The Karthala volcano on the island nation of Cormoros off southern Africa near Mozambique exploded and reports of the island disappearing have reached us. The population of the island was estimated to be 750,000 people."
"The death toll from all the combined disasters during the past 24 hours is estimated to be in the tens of millions, and maybe many times more.  We just do not know how many have died."
"This video is just in to our newsroom showing the effects of the enormous tsunami which hit eastern India and washed over a mile inland."
As the video plays, Jill talks to her producer. "Remember that online video we played of the writer who predicted many years ago that these types of things would occur? That keeps going through my mind as I report them. This is all just too much disaster to have occurred randomly. I have been reading his book and have tried to find a Bible but most of them have been collected under orders from President Antivon. I don't know how I can go on covering these awful events on a daily basis. They are just too awful."
The video ends and Jill continues her coverage of the disasters, switching to the volcanic explosion in Indonesia.  "Reports indicate the volcano and middle part of the island of Sumatra are gone.  The sky is thick with ash and has turned blood-red for millions of square miles.  The ash cloud from this and other volcanic eruptions which have already occurred is expected to decrease sunlight to the earth's surface by at least 15% for years to come...More after this short break..."
A mandatory Public Service Announcement appears on-screen telling all Western Alliance residents that it is their duty to turn in any of their neighbors who waste energy, engage in acts of self-indulgence, or commit any infraction which would harm the Environment. Such things are prohibited as the most heinous acts of disregard for the planet, and is therefore forbidden for the good of us all. Thank you for your cooperation and good citizenship."
Off-air Jill whispers to herself "I think I will just puke if I hear that one more time." Producer Jack Ford cautions Jill to be very, very careful, since you cannot trust anyone anymore.
Things are getting so bad you should consider your friends as enemies. Trust no one. Jill ponders that thought as she is about to restart her news hour.
Jill: "We are back, and the news is not any better than when we left off. Here are the details.	"
Near the end of her broadcast time Jill is covering a story about how the rights of citizens have been severely restricted by the authorities. The endless State of Emergency and Declaration of Martial Law combined have given broad authority to the new Citizen's Police to interrogate and detain people without reason, especially for saying things "harmful to the State." Jill ends her news hour by saying: "These measures have turned honest citizens into criminals, while the real criminals are running the Citizen's Police in violation of the rights of individuals." As she takes off her microphone Jack Ford comes over to her and says "I expect we will hear from the authorities soon.  Jill, you simply need to understand that they can shut us down for saying what you just said. It doesn't matter if you are right any more, it is about power. The authorities have the power, and we no longer have any civil liberties. So although I agree with your thinking, we are vulnerable here. See you tomorrow."
In Israel, Shem and his group of 144,000 evangelists are conferencing by internet.  Shem leads the discussion by pointing out how the recent disasters were prophesied in the Bible. Shem encourages the faithful to remember that their mission is to evangelize, and that these disasters are designed to cause unbelievers to think about the gospel of salvation through Jesus Christ the only Savior.  The group must re-double their efforts to spread the Word of God to those who are lost and seeking meaning in these turbulent times.
Shem has a list of priorities for the group. He starts with making the message relevant to the suffering of the masses under the oppression of dictators. "People are dying from starvation, and their freedoms have been removed by the oppressors. They are seeking Truth -- real Truth. They know instinctively that there is Truth out there. Our task is to give it to them simply and consistently, without holding back, without watering it down, and without fear of the authorities. The spies of the authorities are everywhere. They seek to stop us.  They seek to eliminate us. They seek to prevent people from learning the Truth. Many of us will die because of the Truth. That is not our concern. Our eternal future is secure, and it cannot be taken away. But there are billions who are lost and need salvation. It is true that very few will believe. But we are after those few. Stay strong and focus on saving those few. Now here are your taskings for the week	"
Back in LA, Jill arrives at the news studio the next morning to find several stern looking individuals talking with news producer Jack Ford. They are obviously unhappy. As they see Jill enter the studio one of them comes over and tells her to come over to talk. Jack Ford introduces them as Citizen's Police officers. Jill knows what that means. One of the "officers" addresses Jill saying "We watched your news report yesterday. It was not particularly helpful to the State's attempts to ensure good order in the Western Alliance. You must remember  that you are allowed to broadcast only as long as we approve of what you say. Do you understand what I mean?" Before Jill can answer Jack Ford interjects "We both understand, and we will be more careful, right Jill?" Jill can only nod slightly. The men seem unconvinced but depart without another word. After they have left, Jack says "They are serious.  You did not hear all of what they said, but they obviously meant to scare me into compliance.  We must understand that right or wrong has been replaced with power vs powerless, and enforced by a group outside the legitimate local police. They said they will be watching even more carefully for any non-compliance with their so-called rules for good order, and it is whatever they say it is. I even asked for what rules we violated and they just sneered.  It sent a chill down my spine.  Anyway, time to get back to work.  But Jill, be very careful, please."  Jill agrees to try, but only because of Jack and her friends at the studio. She does not want to get any of them into trouble with these thugs.
After her broadcast is over Jill is back in her apartment thinking to herself how all these incidents she reports on during her news shows were mentioned in the book she has been reading from time to time. Later that night, Jill is once again reading the book "The Future Times." She recalls how the book was mentioned in the You Tube video which she had aired on the day the Vanishment occurred. How quickly things can turn from polite society to thugs running the lives of ordinary people. Law abiding citizens were turned into criminals overnight, while criminals became a Citizen's Police and are hailed as heroes of the State. It was so fast.  In retrospect she sees that the departure of the Christians led to this breakdown of society. They were the ones holding it all together.  They were the ones who believed in right and wrong, truth and lies, good and evil. So true. She resumes reading her book:
Revelation 6:15 “Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.”
No amount of human power, fame, fortune, or lack thereof will shield people from these disasters. There is no hiding in fallout shelters or elsewhere which can avoid these disasters. The great and small alike will suffer and die. But in general they will still refuse to look to God for their salvation. Instead, they pray to rocks:
Revelation 6:16 “They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!”
"This shows the degree of hardness of these unbelievers. They will understand that God is judging them, but will still refuse to believe in Jesus Christ for salvation. They will not pray to God but will pray to rocks to spare them from God, and to bring them death and oblivion. But even if they die, there is no oblivion. Their eternal future will be even worse."
Revelation 6:17 “For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can withstand it?” The disasters will break the will of unbelievers, but even so most refuse to become believers.  The last verse of Chapter 6 asks “who can withstand it?”  The answer is only believers with an understanding of Biblical doctrines in their souls can stand in the face of what is happening, and what is yet to come.  Only believers can stand since they know their future in Heaven is secure, and their life on earth is in God's hands.  This verse also looks forward to the Second Advent of Jesus Christ, the “great day of their wrath” when believers will be delivered and all unbelievers will be removed from the earth.  And as difficult as the first half of the Tribulation will be as a result of these six Seals being opened, the last half will be much worse.
"The first six Seals have now been opened. They will be opened starting early during the Tribulation with the Four Horsemen and the effects will continue throughout the seven year period..."
As Jill reads, her phone rings. She sees it is her mother calling. "Hi Mom." Mom: "Hi, Dear. Hey listen. I need to talk to you about something very important. My friends at the synagogue and I have been reading and looking up a lot of information. We have all concluded that we Jews missed our Messiah. It is like the blinders have fallen off many of us because of the Vanishment -- I mean, the Rapture. It has caused us to see more clearly. The Bible even says this would happen to Jews. Your father is also with us on this issue. I just had to tell you. I think you should also look at this in a new way.  We were wrong for so long.  But it is not too late. Many of us now believe."
Jill: "I believe that is true, Mom. We did miss the Messiah. It was the Rapture we just witnessed. This is now the Great Tribulation. I believe it now. But what will we do? It is all so scary. I do not know how I will hold up under the pressure." Mom replies: "Dear, we are now on the right side of history. The Truth is our guide. Follow the Truth of the Word of God...be strong."
At the Israeli Parliament, Prime Minister Garlock has just formed his new coalition giving him an even stronger majority necessary to exert increased power over Israel. Garlock is known as a secular leftist with radical views on many world issues. His mistrust of traditional Judaism and also for Christian beliefs are well known. Garlock addresses the Parliament:
"Israel must more closely embrace the Western Alliance and President Antivon who shares my views of government. Therefore, Israel must become a more complete partner with the Western Alliance on the world stage." He goes on to lay out his far-leftist plans for Israel, to become an even closer military and economic partner with the Western Alliance. It will include relinquishing a significant amount of Israeli sovereignty to the Western Alliance.
President Antivon calls Israel PM, who is the primary supporter of his image as a god. The two discuss his agenda. They agree to set up a statue of President Antivon in the Temple in Jerusalem. Prime Minister Garlock agrees to make the arrangements and procure the idol statue. He will wait for the signal from President Antivon to put the statue in place in the Temple.
The restrictive socialistic economic policies of the Western Alliance have resulted in shortages of food throughout the Alliance countries. Shortages are especially severe in Western Europe. Food riots are a near daily occurrence. Worker strikes are increasing as wages have stagnated. Commerce is grinding down and many types of goods and services are not available. The workers complain that those who do not work are given more than those who do the work.
Economic incentives to work and produce have been replaced by a system of coercion and punishments. There is open rebellion in the streets across the Western Alliance countries.
But President Antivon remains firm in his intention to create a socialist society based on saving the planet from Capitalists. And wealth is taken from the new Christians who are being martyred in large numbers, which his followers support. His followers become the beneficiaries as Christians are forced to "convert or die."
Bible predictions of Seal 5 become a reality. Christianity is outlawed due to the Bible's prohibition of idolatry, negative passages about homosexuality, and predictions about the future times. The Bible is banned as a "hate book" and ownership of one, or participating in Bible teachings, become a capital offense. Martyrdom of believers intensifies throughout the Western Alliance, which now consists of most of the world except for the Russian Alliance, Chinese Alliance, and Middle East Alliance which have been formed in opposition to the West. Many former enemies have signed alliance agreements in an attempt to counter the massive power of the Western Alliance. The world appears inevitably headed for the largest and most destructive world war ever seen by mankind.
CHAPTER 12
THE NEW JUSTICE AND THE MARK OF THE BEAST

President Antivon institutes a "Citizen Police Corps" made up of thugs who take it upon themselves to bring retribution against those they find to be "enemies of the People." This body of so-called "volunteers" loosely vetted by the State is outside the normal policing processes, and uses a system of intimidation and citizen's arrests, meaning they use force against those they disagree with. They also implement a trial by social media process as ordained by President Antivon. This new process is imposed on the entire Western Alliance and its treaty holders. An "Online Judge & Jury" by social media is conducted when a person is accused. Online voting for conviction or acquittal is established. Having Christian beliefs is a primary cause for accusation, and always ends in conviction unless the accused person renounces those beliefs. Anyone can bring an accusation to this public court, and turning in those who violate the dictates put in place under the State of Emergency is viewed as an act of patriotism. The Citizen Police Corps volunteers conduct a vote on each case of an accused person, and those found guilty are condemned by this jury of their online peers. Volunteers round up those convicted in this online system. Counter arguments are not allowed.
Accusations and judgments are reviewed and voted on in an online "peer" fashion, so everyone in the Western Alliance can watch the vote counter spinning, and those deemed to not embrace "progressive values" including environmentalism as a religion, the earth as sacred, elimination of Christianity worldwide, and President Antivon as a god are subject to being brought to trial online. The online juries are ruthless in accusing and condemning those who do not follow the dictates of the Antivon regime. For the condemned, guillotine capital punishment is activated as on option for the most grievous crimes against the State. Christian beliefs are treated as such serious crimes. Those found guilty are eliminated during mass executions, which can be watched online. The guillotines are kept working day and night to keep up with the demand. The website is a huge success and is played in public buildings, airports, and on giant screens in stadiums throughout the Western Alliance. This gory sport becomes the new "bread and circus" of the Western Alliance which has become known as "The Revived Roman Empire."
President Antivon puts into place more and more controls over the people. He fully institutes his new program to control behavior by limiting access to buying and selling unless the person is in compliance with a long list of The Dear Leader's pronouncements. The term "The Dear Leader" is gaining in popularity, especially among those who see him as some sort of god. Christians are especially targeted, and they call this program of economic exclusion "the Mark of the Beast" throughout the Western Alliance. No one can buy or sell unless they accept "The Mark" imposed by President Antivon, who Christians refer to as the Beast, or the Antichrist, or as the Antichrist.  Christians oppose The Mark vigorously, and many pay for that opposition with their lives. But it has a severe impact, since it splits families apart as they argue for and against taking The Mark in order to survive and feed the family. It is a cruel and vicious program designed to tear the Christian community apart. And it does.
In an online chat room citizens are seen using social media to criticize President Antivon. Their accounts are monitored by the newly formed and highly secretive Citizen Police Corps. Within days these chat room protesters are arrested for their crimes against the State. Their trials are swift and harsh. There is no room for protesting the dictates of the Dear Leader as he is being called by his ardent followers.
At a store in Paris people are standing in long lines buying food where the Mark of the Beast system has been implemented. Food is becoming very scarce, and long lines of people are shown. People using the Mark as their credentials are able to pass through quickly and easily as they scan their Mark App on their phones.  Those who attempt to buy without the Mark App are arrested and taken away by the police. Without the Mark App people are being forced into deprivation and starvation. Things are getting desperate. Starvation is a very persuasive means of coercing compliance.
But some try to resist.  Challenges to the unending Martial Law, State of Emergency, and Mark system reach the Western Alliance Supreme Court. These three are considered by many to be unconstitutional, and likely to be struck down by the Court. Just hours before the vote, a conservative Justice is found dead of suspicious circumstances. After a delay of several days, the Supreme Court challenge is stymied by a four-four vote, therefore the extreme measures continue unabated.
In rural North Carolina, Christians are meeting in secret to discuss the Mark program. The Christian community is divided about the issue since it can mean economic survival for a family. The decisions are difficult. Being a Christian in these times has become a matter of making life or death commitments.
Group Leader Stevens: "Fellow Christians, we have only been believers a short time. The Rapture opened our eyes. But we face stiff opposition, and are persecuted to the point of death. We are being told to accept the Mark of the Beast or we will be cut off from all economic activity. But we must obey the Bible and refuse The Mark. This is a firm stance which we must take. It is meant to test our faith and show the lost and dying world that we believe in Christ as our Savior, and trust in God for our security and well-being."
A fellow new believer speaks up:  "That sounds easy, but is it better to starve my family and see them die from need rather than take The Mark on myself? I have a wife and four young children. How can we be forced to do this? I will lose my job if I do not accept The Mark. It is simply too much to ask. I cannot sit by and watch my family starve for my beliefs.  I feel I must comply and take the consequences. Isn't that the Christian thing to do, to support and protect my family?"
Group Leader Stevens: "It is hard, there is no doubt. No one minimizes the suffering.  But that is the point of it. We must remain strong in the faith. If we take The Mark the Bible says we will die in disgrace and suffer loss of eternal rewards. If we refuse The Mark most of us will live, although some will certainly be martyrs for our faith. It is what God requires of us in this highly unusual time of extreme suffering. We cannot question Him. Taking The Mark is denying the faith. It is that simple. Consider the words of our Lord Jesus when He said:
"Matthew 24:4 “Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7  Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8  All these are the beginning of birth pains. 9 “Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12  Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.”
Group Leader Stevens continues: "When Jesus said “you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death” and “many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other” and “the love of most will grow cold” it shows how desperate these times will be for believers. The Lord knew this. He was talking about us. You and me, right here, right now.
During the Tribulation many believers will lose faith and question why God would allow such evil to exist.  Family members will be divided as their love grows cold, and they will betray each other to the evil authorities.  It will be a time when the faith of believers will be stretched to the breaking point, but there is a reason for it.  We believers must realize we have been specially chosen to convey the message of salvation in this way to a truly wicked generation of hardened unbelievers, and only strong faith and even martyrdom can break through and bring some of those lost souls to salvation.  We must also understand we will either be taken care of and preserved to go into the Millennium for 1000 years of perfect environment on this same earth, or else we will become martyrs and have special blessings as resurrected believers who become priests for the Lord during the Millennium.  Only by focusing on these goals will we  be able to maintain our faith and persevere to the end of the Tribulation or serve the Lord as a martyr, whichever the Lord chooses as our destiny.  Jesus said about us “but the one who stands firm to the end will be delivered”, meaning delivered into the Millennial Kingdom alive to live 1000 years in perfect environment under the rule of Jesus Christ.  But for those who  die as martyrs, there is comfort and extra eternal rewards:
Revelation 7:16 “‘Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst.  The sun will not beat down on them, nor any scorching heat.  17  For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; ‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’  ‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’ ”
