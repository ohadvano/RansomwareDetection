“Gatril,” he said. “Either they’re hiding in the buildings, or they’re out hunting.”
“Then what do we do?” she said. “Should we lay the trap here? This isn’t the queen’s lair.”
Kiran considered his options, and said, “I guess I’ll take that chance.” 
He went to his quacycle, only to have a six-legged fiend fall off a roof onto it. 
It had a glaring pink-red coloration, and a pale face with beady black eyes above two nostrils and its jittering mouthparts that possessed actual human teeth.
Kiran screamed and ran away, stopping once next to the muscular bosdrake. “Eeek! Spider!”
Gatril took the cannon Kiran gave her off her back and positioned the arachnid within her sights. She had previously switched the sticky rounds with a cartridge that held eight lead bullets.
Just one of these creatures made the bosdrake and human nervous, and when more of them crawled out of the houses, unconditional terror embraced them.
“There are dozens of them!” said Kiran, looking at the spiders blocking off all exits. Their thoraxes were long, narrow and flexible, a design granting them the ability to aim their spinnerets over their heads. Their front legs were modified into three-digit grasping appendages. Their mouths made clicking and snapping sounds that Kiran’s ears couldn’t translate.
“Gatril, can you understand them?” he said.
“I’m not familiar with their language I’m afraid,” she said. She saw them inching their way closer. She roared, they snapped into a quick retreat, but advanced once again. All of this spoke to Gatril. They didn’t have the intelligence of beasts to know what a gun was or the power she and Kiran possessed. They moved purely on instinct. Confident in their numbers that their prey would go down.
“Kiran,” said Gatril. “We don’t have a choice now…” 
“Do it!” said Kiran, covering his mouth and nose with his shirt.
Gatril inhaled for a big air push and exhaled, spinning as she spread the green mist. The spiders railed in displeasure. Enraged sounds channeling from their mandibles.
Kiran blasted away two of the spiders. “Run to the back of the town!” 
Gatril and Kiran made toward a street. It was walled off by webs—until Gatril melted it with acid. But the further the pair went, the more spiders they saw coming at them. 
Kiran and Gatril had a little more speed as opposed to the spiders burdened by their hard exoskeleton; which they compensated for with the long reach of their spewing webs at the feet of the fleeing duo.
Gatril burned them another passage through the webs, and a third. Kiran used his earth-pillar and made a path over the webs on the ground and the spiders coming from the sides. Gatril took a few shots that popped messy yellow holes in their hides. The spiders screamed and collapsed. Kiran used his force-counter and knocked away three more of the spiders into the side of a house.
Their persistence led them to a path into a thin forest where they found more deceased animals entangled in the webs, and a smell of stale urine and moss assailed their senses like a stealthy, stinky predator.
But in the distance, Kiran and Gatril saw it.
“There’s a cave!” said Gatril, her keen eyesight catching it before the human.
The dark hollow was supplanted into the side of a high mound. Threads stained in yellow split from the mouth and matted around it. The plants were withered as if the threads were robbing them of life, and the pungent smell tripled.
Kiran spun around with his staff, ready. But to his surprise the spiders hesitated. “Look, they stopped.”
Gatril witnessed the once bloodthirsty arachnids stalling, placing their feet forward and back, hesitant as their food was so close, yet so was the abode of the female. 
“Are they afraid of the female?” said Gatril.
“At least they aren’t going to kill us anymore.” Kiran took Gatril’s arm and walked back into the cave, keeping his eyes on the males just in case they mustered enough courage to come closer. 
The sunlight died soon inside, and Kiran felt goosebumps all over him. “We forgot the lantern back on the quacycle,” he said. “Gatril, can you by any chance breathe fire yet?”
“Not naturally like my stomach acid,” she said. “If we had some potassium and glycerin to eat I could though.”
Kiran channeled his spirit energy into his staff. “I guess it’s a good thing I made this spell with Trewanti’s queex.”
Kiran activated his fourth spell from a white orb with blue streaks. Light swelled from it, forming its photons into the shape of an eye. The iris sparkled and a second body of radiance stung the dark out of existence, revealing a rocky ceiling from which twisting roots ran into the walls and floor, all covered in moss. Insects who relished the dark hurried from the scorching light exuding from Kiran’s staff.
“Shall we?” said Kiran.
Gatril shoved Kiran along. “Stop trying to sound all fancy like.”
Kiran and Gatril found two separate, winding paths. The angle making it seem the lumpy walls intended to close and chew them up. The first one they took revealed insects and small rodents who expertly traverse the surface of the web-laden walls and ceiling. It seemed to have been an adaptation, which made Gatril in particular wonder how long the j’bafofi had been here.
The width of the path grew as they went, seeming more befitting of the massive beast fabled to live inside here. Then they reached the end, but contrary to the fangs, claws and beady eyes they were expecting, a mass of corpses piled on top of each other stood at the end, waiting on them like some sick trick.
“Holy crap…” Kiran tried to contain the urge to vomit, triggered by the scent that burnt his lungs.
