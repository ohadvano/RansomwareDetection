I can only stare at him and wonder where I fit in all of this. “If you must know officer, Mr. Daniels was a great teacher who loved his job and cared about a lot of people. He'd always make sure that if any student of his needed extra help or support that he'd always be there for them. So, to answer your question about if I got along with him then the answer would be of course I did. He was always there whenever I needed someone to talk to about my dad who left, and no matter what he'd always listen and he'd tell me that I didn't need a father because I was strong enough to look after myself and my mother. I hope that answers your question.” I leave Tom standing alone in the kitchen and rush out to the front of the house making my way towards the car.
I get to my car, pick the right key and open the door when I hear my name being called several times. I ignore the voice and start getting into the car when a hand grabs onto my arm pulling me away from the car. I turn and stare directly into Ryder's eyes.
“Where do you think you're going?”
I remove Ryder's hand from my arm and move back to the car. “Away from here where I won't be interrogated like a bad person.”
Ryder's voice deepens. “Did Tom say something to you?”
I scoff. “What do you think we've been talking about for the past half hour? The weather?”
Ryder just looks at me. “Did he give you a hard time in there?”
“A hard time? He thinks...” I shake my head dumbfounded. “He thinks I'm somehow involved in the case because I knew the victims.”
“What?” Ryder looks at me in confusion. “Why would he think that you're involved?”
