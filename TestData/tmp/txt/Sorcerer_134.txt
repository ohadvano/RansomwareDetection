“A woman’s crotch juice, son,” said another. He glared at Kiran. “You want to find a selkie woman to rape, human?”
“No! No!” said Kiran. “I’m just trying to find one that’s willing to give me! I-I’m not a sexplorer! Honest! I have a bosdrake friend!”
The woman laughed, while the selkies made guttural chuckles. She said, “Oh really? Then where is this bosdrake friend of your?”
“Here!” Gatril leaped out of the bushes. “Let the human go!”
Kiran said, “Gatril! How did you find me?”
“I followed your scent,” she said. “When you didn’t make it back this evening, I figured something might have happened to you. I told you you’re too stupid to go about on your own.”
“This boy trespassed on my property,” said the woman. “He’ll have to pay for it.”
Gatril accessed her second stomach and spat a ball of acid. The selkies hurried away from the steaming blob that melted into the ground. “And I say we talk about it,” said Gatril. “Do you really want to start a fight with the children here?”
The selkies turned to the woman after being unable to come to their own conclusion. The human female noticed Gatril’s tense posture and her clenched fists. After looking at the innocent faces of the young ones, the woman said, “Very well. We’ll talk inside my house.”
The woman brought them into the living room, instructing them to sit. She was accompanied by two of the males, who stood at her sides as guards. Kiran sat close to Gatril.
“My name is Eyeka,” said the woman. “You said you were a sorcerer, boy?”
“Yeah,” Kiran replied. “My friend hear is Gatril. She decided to help get the ingredients for my spells.”
“A bosdrake…” said Eyeka. “To think you would venture this far with a human companion.”
“And to think you would be breeding for beasts,” said Gatril, glancing at Eyeka’s stomach. “I would like to hear the story behind it.”
“It’s a simple one,” said Eyeka. “You see, the selkie men on my property have a bit of a problem. Their females have been kidnapped by various bandits and sold to sexplorers around the kingdoms. So they came to me with a proposal; I would bare their children, and they would provide me with enough fish to increase the profit of my business.”
“Wait,” said Kiran. “Were they really scaring away the people who come to the river?”
“Can you blame them?” said Eyeka. “Their women have been taken as slaves, and they’re under constant attack from monster hunters and the Riverwench. Their population is shrinking.” Eyeka rubbed her stomach. “But I think this time, I’ll give birth to a female.”
“Wait a minute,” said Kiran. “Did you just say a Riverwench?”
“Yes,” said one of the selkies. “She lives in a nest nearby, terrorizing everything in the river.”
“I’ve never heard a creature like that before,” said Gatril. She turned to young man, who was deep in his thoughts. “What is it, Kiran?”
He said, “It’s closely related to a selkies. She’s a female selkie that underwent a special mutation due to eating certain foods. They’re big and aggressive. But I’m surprised the selkies didn’t try to mate with her.”
“We did try,” said one of selkies. “She ate the males that approached her.”
“Ouch,” said Gatril.
Then Kiran said, “Why I am interested is that I can get the same ingredients for my spell from her.”
“You can?” said Gatril.
“Yeah,” Kiran said. “It’s dangerous. I didn’t want to fight monsters of that category without my spells, that’s why I was saving the J’bafofi for last. But,” Kiran looked at the concerned faces of the others, “I think I might need to now.”
“You would dare to challenge the Riverwench?” one of the males said.
“Well, she’s not as dangerous as a J’bafofi,” said Kiran. “If I have Gatril with me, we just might be able to do it.”
“It would be a huge favor to us,” said Eyeka. “The selkies could begin to expand territory if that beast is gone.”
Kiran smiled. “Think of it as a way of me repaying you for trespassing.” He turned to Gatril. “What do you say, you trust me to get this done?”
Gatril sighed. “You haven’t displayed exemplary leadership so far. But I’m still stupid enough to follow you.”
Minutes later, Kiran and Gatril were led up the side of the stream by three of the selkies. The water-body became a river, getting deeper the further they went. The moonlight above was adequate over the water, but being a human, Kiran lent his trust to his lantern. The river wound through the jungle, and they came upon a settlement of straw huts on the river banking where they met around twenty other selkies. Men and children. 
“It looks like their population really is shrinking,” said Gatril.
Their escort waved away the curious onlookers, assuring they meant no harm, and brought the human and bosdrake to a section of the river where a sort of wooden fence had been built across the water. The top was sharpened to points that leaned in the other direction as a deterrent from anything rushing towards the settlement.
Gatril had seen similar things built by tribes around their homes when they wished to keep predators at bay, and the selkies probably did it to bar off crocodiles and raging hippos.
