I can only shrug. “I don't know what to say.”
Sam frowns. “Do you think maybe they were trying to lip read me?”
“What makes you think that?”
“Well, when I was sitting in the cafeteria, they were all staring at me like they were waiting for something. And then again in Math, I was talking to you on the phone and Ryder would not stop looking at me, and he doesn't even have Math!”
Maybe I should tell Sam about what happened last night at the diner, I want to involve her in on what goes on in my life.
“Maybe they were staring because they kind of ambushed me last night after work.”
She shrieks, “What!?”
“I was ambushed by the four of them after work except for Kellan, he stayed out of the confrontation part, but the rest of them interrogated me about the night I was bitten.”
Sam moves to lie on her side with a confused expression on her face. “Why would they want to know about what happened to you that night?”
