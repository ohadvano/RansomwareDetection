“When will you be coming back?” his mother said, her round face looking perturbed.
“In about two weeks,” Kiran said. “I’ll need to register for the tournament soon.”
“So long?” she retorted. “Your allowance won’t last all that time, you know.”
“Don’t worry,” Kiran said, “I can find some jobs around the villages if I need to.”
“Do you have your ID Kiran?” his father said.
“I do, dad.” Kiran took it out of his pocket and held it up for them to see. It was a pass-card was a translucent piece of material with one’s name, address and their fingerprint. 
“Good,” the man said. “Be sure to stay out of trouble.”
“Yessir,” Kiran said.
His mother waved at him. “Be careful dear! And good luck!”
Kiran waved back and hopped onto his vehicle, pedaling off down the road. Passing through his community he saw the brothel where visitors to the town frequented, as well as bars and various workshops. The hospital along with the police department and the village headman’s office was in the town square, but Kiran took his journey closer to the eastern outskirts of the village where the jungle was.
Reaching the lonely path again, Karin turned into the forest. Yet, he didn’t need to go far, as Gatril was there waiting on him, sitting wearing a loincloth over her privates and a bra of matted leaves. She had a small pouch tied around her waist as well, and munched on a handful on fruits.
Kiran parked his vehicle and approached her. “I see you’re all set.”
Gatril swallowed and said, “Hmph. You brought a lot of stuff with you. I hope you have food.”
“I do,” he said. “You sure do eat a lot.
“Bosdrakes don’t like going anywhere on an empty stomach,” said Gatril. “And we expend a lot of energy during fights.”
Kiran shrugged lightly. “Okay. So, our first mission is finding a lamia!”
Gatril swallowed her last bit of food and said, “Those are a bit bigger than I am.”
Kiran took a book from out of his backpack and flipping through the pages. “I know. I have a bestiary.” Kiran held the book up so she could see. Gatril saw the image of a coiled serpent with arms, legs and a human-like head and neck. Beneath it were some notes about the creature, it’s diet and habitat.
Gatril made a thoughtful hum. “These books aren’t always accurate. Sometimes the monsters’ behavior may change along with their environment.”
“Well that’s what you’re here to help with.” Kiran put away the book. “Anyways, we should get started.”
Kiran hopped onto his quacycle and gestured to a space behind him. Gatril carefully climbed on and held onto Kiran’s waist. “I’ve never rode one of these things before.”
“Don’t worry,” Kiran said. “I’m an expert.”
“…Why don’t I feel confident in what you’re saying?” Gatril said dryly.
Kiran chuckled and turned on the engine. Steam spewed from the tubes, and he rode out of the city of trees. 
It wasn’t uncommon for monsters to be seen outside of their wild habitats, however people took care to avoid the beasts, even though they possessed the intelligence to communicate. Kiran and Gatril left the thinning jungle and came upon a small grassy plain, inhabited by gazelles, wild boars and zebras.
Gatril licked her lips as she seized up the animals. “I could eat one of those right now…”
“Focus,” said Kiran. “We need to keep an eye out for predators too.”
“That’s what I’m doing,” Gatril said. “Don’t start lecturing me, human. Beasts know more about the wild than any man.”
Kiran rolled his eyes and acquiesced to her statement. Then, within his fied of vision, Kiran caught something in the distance, and pointed to it. “Look over there!”
Gatril turned her gaze towards the west, where in the distance she could make out a cluster of tall buildings, almost hidden beneath the looming mountains. “That’s Cronbark,” she said. “It’s one of the cities in the Tatanui kingdom, isn’t it?”
“Yeah,” said Kiran, looking aspiringly at the constructs. “That’s where I’ll go and register once I’ve gathered my spells.” He giggled. “I can’t wait!”
It was over two hours later when they finally made it to their destination; a plain of bare earth covered in scattered bushes, trees and rocks. This allowed for loose soil, the perfect kind for a lamia to burrow through
Kiran said, “Here we are,” and he and Gatril got off their transport. Kiran parked the quacycle near a tree under the shade, then checked his cannon once more, as well as the ammunitions. He fitted his staff in the small sheath on his backpack as well as the necessary jars from the trolley inside it.
After watching him go through all of this, Gatril said, “So how do you plan on tracking down the lamia?”
“Well,” Kiran hesitated for a while, “Lamia are beasts, so they have human intelligence, but still live like animals. It’s a reptile, so it needs to be somewhere cool to bring down its metabolism.”
