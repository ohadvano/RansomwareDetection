When I enter the living room, I see that Bane and Silver have taken place on the sofa covered in Afghans thanks to Sam who sits in the armchair. She's still looking at Bane again with a huge grin on her face. Ryder takes his place standing by the window, while Kellan remains by my side.
I leave the room to grab Kellan a spare blanket but when I return I notice that nobody has said a word.
After what feels like hours of intense silence, Sam decides to break the ice.
“Alright, what the hell is going on?”
When nobody answers, she looks at me questioningly.
“Alice?”
Here goes nothing.
I look around the room to see that everyone's looking at me expectantly. “Last night at the diner.” I gulp and look away from everyone. “I heard Bane threaten our regular Paul, for staring at all of you, and I knew something was wrong when I was able to hear everything.”
I look towards Bane to see him staring at me with the same sneer still on his face.
