And as Kiran walked from behind his cover, the batoiko fell from the tree upon him, dropping Kiran with a blow to his shoulder.
Kiran yelped and reflexively pulled the trigger. A round exploded against the base of a tree. Kiran rolled over and was greeted by the female’s crude looking mass and mane of hay around it. He screamed and brought the butt of his gun across the batoiko’s face, but the female pulled away.
She wrestled the weapon from Kiran with a startling strength and pulled a knife from the waist of her skirt. Excited, strange words rolled off her tongue as she lifted the blade.
“No!” Kiran crossed his arms over his head and clamped his eyes shut.
And Gatril leaped onto the batoiko like a lion, having been alerted to Kiran’s smell. The female failed to react in time as Gatril bit down on her shoulder, spun with her and tossed her aside.
The woman kicked up leaves as she rolled across the ground. She screamed choppy words and sprung onto her feet. She spotted what attacked her, and like a predator over its kill, Gatril stood on all fours over Kiran, her breasts dangling tantalizingly over his face.
Gatril made a snarl that shook the air around her, and having gotten the message, the batoiko woman squeaked and ran off.
“Little insects…” Gatril sneered.
Gatril looked down at the human and crawled off him. Kiran sprung up and reached for his cannon. “Th-Thank you!” he said, trying to catch his breath.
But Gatril’s face repelled his thanks with an irked frown. “You really are a clumsy weak human. This is the second time you almost got killed out here.”
Kiran dusted the leaves off him. “I’m sorry, Gatril! I’m not really a fighter like that.”
“Yes,” said Gatril, “a deer with apples on its feet is more like it.” Kiran frowned at her, but the dragon was unperturbed. “Just follow me.” And Gatril walked away.
Kiran trailed behind Gatril, mindful of her undulating tail and the possible other threats lying in wait for them. It wasn’t long before Gatril brought them upon her home. Kiran had been expecting from the stories his grandfather told him about dragons a tunnel leading to a massive cavern filled to the brim with treasures collected from around the world. 
This wasn’t the case.
The mass of branches bent and folded around four trees, covered by a layer of large leaves knitted together. The scene managed to spark both disappointment and intrigue in Kiran. “This is where you live?” he said.
“Yes,” said Gatril. “Wonderful, isn’t it?”
Kiran studied the finer details of the construction, noting that it resembled a dome somewhat, along with wooden posts that made up the frame. The inside had two straw beds, the second Gatril had prepared the previous night. Lighting was provided by holes in the walls, covered by large leaves. 
Gatril gestured to one of the beds. “Sit.”
“Umm…” Kiran carefully seated himself, looking across at the bosdrake on her own bed.
“So,” said Gatril, “Kiran, let me see what you’ve got.”
Kiran took out jars, scalpels, tiny prongs, his lunch and a book out of his bag and laid them on the floor. Beside the book, he put everything else aside, and opened the text. “This is a book of all spells that can be easily done with animal parts,” he said.
Gatril took the book and looked through the first five pages. She put it down and said, “But you know in order to do spells, you have to be able to use your spirit energy?”
Kiran replied with a sly grin. He opened his palm. His forehead furrowed with concentration, and he produced a faint white light in his hand. “I already learned it. My grandfather taught me.”
Gatril’s face puckered. She hadn’t been expecting this level of commitment from the boy. “That’s impressive,” she said. “Accessing one’s spiritual energy can’t be done by just anyone. You and your grandfather seem to have latent talent for it.”
“We do,” he said. “My father’s side comes from a long line of sorcerers and witches. My grandfather, when he was younger, he failed to slay a wyvern that was terrorizing a town. He was ashamed and forced himself into retirement. His name as a wizard wasn’t good anymore. That’s why his son, my father, took on carpeting as a profession. But I want to become a sorcerer just like we used to be.”  Kiran dispelled the light from him hand and relaxed. “So, like…how are we going to start this?” Kiran took out a smooth ovoid object and some water. “I’d brought these to…you know…” and Kiran made a thrusting motion with the object.
Gatril slapped the objects from Kiran’s hands. Kiran flinched, forming a pout as he stared at her. “Rubbish! Is that how you intend to get what you want?”
Kiran nervously rubbed his neck. “Well I don’t know how else.”
“You’ve never had sex before, you said?” Gatril said.
“Nope,” said Kiran. “Not with a human or a beast.”
“Hmm,” said Gatril. “I guess you’re not a sexplorer then.”
“A what?” Kiran said.
“Sexplorers,” said Gatril. “They’re humans who travel the world with the goal of having sex with rare and exotic people and monsters. They’re mostly men, though you have a few horny women who do it too.”
“Wow,” Kiran said. “That’s really perverted. Have you ever met one?”
“Once,” said Gatril. “He was a foreigner. He was a nice man. But he was a rarity. Sexplorers are usually rapists. Some even kill and eat the monsters they have sex with.”
Something ran up Kiran’s back and made him shudder. “Well, I’m not like that! I just want ingredients for my spells.”
