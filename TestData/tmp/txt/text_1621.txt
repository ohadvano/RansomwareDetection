He takes it from my fingers, tears the packet open with his teeth, pulls his boxers down and kicks them off to the side.
With steady hands I remove my sweatpants, close my eyes when I feel him climb onto the bed and placing himself between my thighs.
“Alice.” He whispers.
My eyes open slowly to see his eyes looking at me with passion. He leans down, kisses me softly and pushes himself inside me in slow and gentle movements.
I wince at the sudden intrusion and the feeling of discomfort, and when he pushes inside me again, my eyes clench tightly from the pain he's causing.
I know that it's not his fault but nothing had prepared me for this.

I shake my head repeatedly not wanting to stop this unfamiliar feeling. “No.”
