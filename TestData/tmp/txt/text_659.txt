She shrugs. 'I mean, I can see where you're coming from. You've got Ryder who's an Alpha and has his own pack. We don't know what kind of pack they are and what they do or what they're capable of, but they don't really seem that bad. Yes, they might have anger issues but I've never heard or seen them beat up a random person before. As for Max, we have no idea who he is or his history. I mean we just met him yesterday, and he seems like a genuinely nice guy but again we don't really know him.” Sam turns the TV volume down. “We're at an impasse, Alice.”
I lie on my side and sigh. “It just doesn't make sense! Why would Max say that Ryder, Kellan and Bane beat him up? Unless Ryder's a good liar and he's brainwashed his pack to believing that they didn't do it.”
“Look, I think it's been a long day. We need to chill, not mention any boys and just watch Chuck Bass being sexy.”
“That sounds great, but I'm more of a Nate Archibald fan.”
After hours of watching episodes of Gossip Girl and eating piles of chocolate, we decide to turn in for an early night. I leave her room to go down the kitchen for a glass of milk, when I feel my head starting to pound. It's probably caused after the shouting and the stress of today.
I shake it off, grab a glass, open the fridge and grab the milk.
As I pour the milk into the glass my whole body feels like it's going through a heat wave, and everything around me starts to blur.
Oh, no! Please, no!
My legs give out beneath me making the glass in my hand shatter to the floor into a million pieces. I taste a metallic tang in my mouth that tastes a lot like blood. Inside my mouth, I feel an agonising pain in my oral cavity that's unbearable to cope with. I carefully run my tongue along the bottom of my mouth and freeze. I start to feel very sharp canine teeth forming on top of my human teeth. My hearing becomes clearer which allows me to hear my heart racing inside my chest. Shaking with fear, my legs start to numb leaving me no choice but to double over onto the floor on all fours. I can hear Sam running down the stairs shouting my name repeatedly, but I have no strength to answer her. The pain in my stomach becomes so unbearable that it makes it hard for me to breathe properly. My arms start to ache from trying to keep upright off the floor. What I don't expect next is for my hands to start hurting. I squint hard enough to concentrate on my left hand to see what's causing the pain, and realize my nails have elongated into sharp claws. The pain is excruciating.
