“So, what? We just wait for him to get here?” I take a seat on the brown leather couch while Ryder stands in the middle of the room. “That's the plan.”
“And we're just gonna talk to him.” Ryder says nothing.
“Right, Ryder? You've got to remember that he's not an Alpha like you, so no fighting, okay?”
Ryder grits out. “Whatever you say.”
We waited a full hour and when we thought he'd be a no show, we were both startled by the sound of the back door slamming.
We remain quiet from our positions, waiting for Max to appear. There's no surprise when he shows less than a minute later without any sign of an injury from the fight with Ryder.
He stares at the broken down door in confusion. “What the fuck man?” Max looks at Ryder with a disapproving frown.
Something tells me that it wasn't a good idea to come here after all.
Ryder sighs and looks at him with a bored expression, “Sit down. We need to talk.”
