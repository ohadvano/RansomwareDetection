“We should get going,” said Gatril. “bultungins usually get active at night. And we already pissed off a gang of them.”
Kiran and Gatril got on the quacycle and rode off, while Shirksire walked back to the town. 
“Well,” said Gatril, “you’ve acquired all your spells, young sorcerer. I guess you only need to prepare for your grand debut at the tournament.”
Kiran said, “Yeah, but that’s only the first part. After that I’ll need to raise money doing a lot of missions. I still remember my promise to carry you to Puzzland. And I want to discover different magical artifacts on the uncharted continents.”
Gatril’s arms slinked around Kiran affectionately. “Do you think we can say we are boyfriend and girlfriend now?”
“That’s if you mind sharing,” said Kiran. “The uncharted worlds are really dangerous, so I’ll need as much support as I can get. I think I really will each Shirksire how to use magic. Heck, maybe all the other girls can join me.”
“So long as you eat my crotch the most, I don’t mind,” said Gatril.
Kiran looked over his shoulder at Gatril, and said, “Don’t worry, you’ll always be my main girl.”
Gatril’s mouth was slightly ajar, and she closed it. She smiled at Kiran and kissed his cheek. 
Kiran turned his attention back to the road, grinning. Have I got a story for you, grandpa.
