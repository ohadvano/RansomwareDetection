Ryder doesn't say anything for a while. “Kellan call your dad, but make sure he doesn't bring any reporters here.
The last thing I need is people pointing their fingers at me making me out to be the murderer.”
He dismisses Kellan and looks at both of his Betas. “I want you two to stay clear when Kellan's dad gets here. Do whatever you feel the need to do. Search the area, look for footprints, but for gods sakes don't shift. We don't want to add more fuel to the fire.”
Both Silver and Bane leave without a word.
Ryder comes over to me and rests his hands gently on my shoulders. “The cops will be here soon, searching the area for a few hours, but you can stay and get yourself cleaned up or I can take you home.”
My mother won't be home for a few hours and the thought of being alone especially with someone out there watching me sickens me. “I'll stay if it's okay with you. I don't want to be alone after...” I look over at Terry and feel my eyes welling up with tears again.
Ryder immediately pulls me into his arms in an embracing hug and holds me for a few minutes. “You can stay with me as long as you want. It's easier for me to protect you if you're with me.”
I wrap my arms around his neck and pull him deeply to me. It's the first contact I've had with another person since finding Terry, and it's all become very overwhelming.
Shortly after the moment with Ryder, I leave to go into the house and into the en suite bathroom in Ryder's room. I spend a good amount of time in the shower to gather my thoughts and think about what will happen when word gets out that Terry has become a victim of the murderer.
