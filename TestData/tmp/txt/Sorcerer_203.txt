“W-What?” Kiran sounded panicky. “B-But who?”
Something landed before them. They sprung up and scattered themselves to get room to commence battle. 
“What the hell was that?” Kiran said. He quickly switched on the lantern, revealing the bucket of blood. 
“It threw the bucket back!” Aparna said.
Gatril went to Kiran and took the lantern from him. “What are you doing?” he said.
Gatril ignored Kiran and tossed it in the grass near the trees. With the dry weather they were having, the ground quickly caught fire. Gatril retreated with the others, waiting impatiently as adrenaline surged through her veins.
“Come on you bastard,” Gatril sneered.
Then their adversary walked into the light, his formed revealed. The officer from the forest lookout post.
“You!” Kiran said.
“I knew I felt something off about him,” said Aparna.
The officer didn’t have any firearms, but then again what fun would they be? He was all smiles as he waltz towards them. “I told you children it was not a good idea to come into the forest. Now I’ll have to show you why.”
Gatril stood before Kiran, bearing her teeth. “Kiran, get back and use that spell of yours. Aparna, can you fight?”
Aparna took off her cloak and took out her revolver and knife. “I wouldn’t have been here if I couldn’t.”
Kiran kept his focus and channeled his spirit energy into his staff. “Popobawa!” he said. “I came here only for your queex. If you can masturbate and give it to me, I can give you anything else in return but us!”
“Oh, boy, but I do want you all,” he said. The man’s body suddenly gave off a dark mist and broke apart, recombining into a lanky figure with gruesomely sharp claws on its hands and feet, and dark hair swaying off her head with the texture of bristles.
The shape was undeniably feminine; a small waist with wide hips, and ample breasts. Her face had a single red eye glaring at them like hot coal, above a half-open mouth filled with sharp teeth. Her ears were pointy, her skin of a reddish hue, and striking, membranous black wings sprouted out of her back like the cursed sails of an old, lost ship.
Kiran clenched his ass cheeks. “Yeeek!”
“I’ll drink your blood and screw you all!” the popobawa said, and her clitoris abruptly swelled until it resembled a throbbing phallus.
“Attack!” said Gatril, lunging at the popobawa.
She leapt over the bosdrake and struck her in the back with her foot. Gatril winced and fell, but got up and leaped at her once more. The popobawa attacked but Gatril slammed her tail into the popobawa’s thigh.
The bat-creature yelled and took to the sky with a flap of her wings, cackling dreadfully as she zipped through the air. The popobawa dove at them with the intended vice-grip of her talons, forcing the trio into a frantic duck-for-cover scenario.
Gatril and Aparna tried to counter with acid and gunfire, but the popobawa was too fast for their attacks.
The flying attacker came after Kiran, and the boy ducked and fell. He still clung to his staff, pulling water from the air into a huge ball that had already grown as big as himself.
“Everyone!” said Gatril. “I’ll use my stun-fog! Cover your noses!”
Gatril predicted the popobawa had become quite comfortable in her swooping technique, and if she could just execute it when the popobawa was in her descent, it would affix her into a dive right into Gatril’s attack.
But the popobawa struck first, vomiting a dark smog. She flew in a circle around them to completely shroud them in the black smoke.
Aparna fanned the substance from her face and pulled her blouse over her nose. She turned to Kiran, but his form immediately became obscured. “Kiran!”
“Gatril? Aparna?” Kiran called to his friends, but could only hear them. He could vaguely make out the massive sphere of water before him. 
Almost ready, he thought.
Not even Gatril’s feral eyes could penetrate the darkness, yet alone that of the humans. But the popobawa’s single eye was specifically designed for such a task, able to clearly discern their body temperature and shape.
And Kiran was the perfect option for the popobawa. The popobawa snatched him by his shoulders and hoisted him into the air.
“Uhh! Help! Let go of me!” Kiran kicked but his thrashing was piddly compared to the strength of the popobawa.
“Don’t worry!” the popobawa said. “You’ll be screaming a whole lot when I bust open that ass of yours.”
Below, Kiran could see the smoke clearing, and the flames continuing to spread. No! Kiran thought. I got everyone into this mess! I should be able to save myself!
Kiran felt his spirit energy depleting, but the water he gathered was enough. He launched the liquid sphere over his head and it shuddered, bulged and popped.
