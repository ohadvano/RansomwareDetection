“That's the second time I've seen you covered in bruises and cuts, and I still don't know the reason behind it. You shouldn't mess with someone like Ryder, because he'll win every time.”
Max doesn't say anything.
“I'm sorry, I didn't mean to insult you.”
“No, I like the fact that you care about me. It's nice to know that somebody does at least.”
As a way of an apology I lean forward, clutch him tightly to my chest in a friendly embrace, but as I pull back, his face is inches away from mine. I stay rooted to the spot not knowing what to do, and before I have the chance to process what's happening, Max's lips meet mine.
I jerk my head back quickly and move to put some distance between us.
Max closes his eyes and shakes his head. “I'm so sorry. I don't know what I was thinking.”
“No it's fine. You don't need to apologise.”
Max avoids eye contact, looks down at the floor to realize that his shirt is torn.
