I'm taken aback and look at Ryder with a frown. “I don't judge you for kissing her.”
Ryder leans right into my face. “Then answer me this, why do I feel so guilty that it was you who walked through that door?”
Before I have a chance to reply, the door downstairs closes and our little moment is broken too quickly. He looks at me one last time, turns and jumps out the window. I rush to it just as I see him remove his shirt and running away from my home in the pouring rain.
I don't hear the door to my room open, I just stare into the night and at the spot where I last saw Ryder before he disappeared into the woods.
“Alice? You're awake.”
When I meet my mother's eyes she smiles warmly at me. “Yeah, I couldn't sleep.”
“You okay?” She looks at me with worry written on her face.
I turn away from the window to look at her. “Yeah, I'll be fine.”
“Well, I for one can't wait to lie down.”
