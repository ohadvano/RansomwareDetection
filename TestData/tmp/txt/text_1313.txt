Kellan looks at the officer. “None of us did it dad, but I'm telling you someone placed him there intentionally to make it look like Ryder did it.”
Tom nods. “I'm not pointing any fingers at anyone, but I'm going to have to ask you these questions. I'm just doing my job so just cooperate with me, okay?”
Ryder scoffs. “'Fine.”
The police officer takes out a pad, a pen then clears his throat. “Where were you between 10:00 am and 12:00 pm today?”
Ryder doesn't hesitate. “I went out for a run.” “Be more specific, where did you run?”
Ryder sighs and points behind Tom to where the clearing of the forest all of us ran through. “Through that clearing there and ran into the forest.”
Tom writes down Ryder's statement. “Were you with anyone or were you by yourself?”
“We went our separate ways for the run today, but none of us was in the area when the murder took place.”
Tom nods again. “Can anyone vouch for that?”
