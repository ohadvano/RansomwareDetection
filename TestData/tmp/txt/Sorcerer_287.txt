He said, “It’s closely related to a selkies. She’s a female selkie that underwent a special mutation due to eating certain foods. They’re big and aggressive. But I’m surprised the selkies didn’t try to mate with her.”
“We did try,” said one of selkies. “She ate the males that approached her.”
“Ouch,” said Gatril.
Then Kiran said, “Why I am interested is that I can get the same ingredients for my spell from her.”
“You can?” said Gatril.
“Yeah,” Kiran said. “It’s dangerous. I didn’t want to fight monsters of that category without my spells, that’s why I was saving the J’bafofi for last. But,” Kiran looked at the concerned faces of the others, “I think I might need to now.”
“You would dare to challenge the Riverwench?” one of the males said.
“Well, she’s not as dangerous as a J’bafofi,” said Kiran. “If I have Gatril with me, we just might be able to do it.”
“It would be a huge favor to us,” said Eyeka. “The selkies could begin to expand territory if that beast is gone.”
Kiran smiled. “Think of it as a way of me repaying you for trespassing.” He turned to Gatril. “What do you say, you trust me to get this done?”
Gatril sighed. “You haven’t displayed exemplary leadership so far. But I’m still stupid enough to follow you.”
Minutes later, Kiran and Gatril were led up the side of the stream by three of the selkies. The water-body became a river, getting deeper the further they went. The moonlight above was adequate over the water, but being a human, Kiran lent his trust to his lantern. The river wound through the jungle, and they came upon a settlement of straw huts on the river banking where they met around twenty other selkies. Men and children. 
“It looks like their population really is shrinking,” said Gatril.
Their escort waved away the curious onlookers, assuring they meant no harm, and brought the human and bosdrake to a section of the river where a sort of wooden fence had been built across the water. The top was sharpened to points that leaned in the other direction as a deterrent from anything rushing towards the settlement.
Gatril had seen similar things built by tribes around their homes when they wished to keep predators at bay, and the selkies probably did it to bar off crocodiles and raging hippos.
A selkie who they’d come to know as Tokko pointed over the fence and said, “Over that barrier is where the Riverwench lives. The beast is dangerous. She’s taken on three of our finest fighters at a time and bested them. Be careful.”
Kiran readied his gun. “Thanks for the help. Come on Gatril.”
Kiran made his way around the barrier that had spread even further inland, trekking back to the riverbanks with Gatril leading the way with the lantern now in her hand. They had spotted the reflective eyes of crocodiles in the river, but they smelt Gatril’s presence and kept at away. 
“I wonder how her lair would look?” Kiran’s voice was both curious and concerned.
“Probably something like that,” said Gatril, pointing to massive construct that ran from the edge of the river and into jungle. The two of them could only describe it as a colossal, horizontal termite mound of vines and sticks woven together.
Kiran clutched his weapon tighter. Too many times he had been panicking when encountering these beasts. He needed to muster his resolve once and for all. He turned to Gatril and said, “Do you smell anything?”
“I smell her,” Gatril said, “and something…rotten.” Gatril crept closer to the nest when her eye caught something. She washed the light of the lantern over it, revealing gnawed bones of various animals littering the place.
Kiran studied the remains and found among remains the parts of crocodiles, deer, gazelles, hippos, lions, selkies, and humans. “…This place…it’s…” He shuddered.
A deep hiss suddenly crackled in the air. Kiran and Gatril scampered away from the nest. “She knows we’re here!” said Gatril.
“Quick!” said Kiran. “Set the nest on fire!”
Gatril tossed the lantern upon the nest with so much force the glass shattered, splashing the flammable liquid everywhere. The crackling and snapping of the oxidation of the nest and its subsequent combustion spread along with the flames.
Kiran had an idea, and said to Gatril, “Do you know how to use a gun?”
“Just point and pull the trigger, right?” she said.
He tossed the gun to her and said, “The cartridge has four shots. They’re sticky rounds, so aim at her feet.”
And just as Kiran got his staff ready, the nest burst outward. Thrashing arms flung debris from the face of the beast. It stood at eight feet tall, squat built with green-brown skin. Its large head was vaguely humanoid but the green eyes were wide-set, along with a massive mouth. It had long, wiry webbed arms and a large dorsal fin. Its hair was long and stringy, soaked in some kind of fluid. But what caught Kiran’s eyes besides the toothy maw were the smooth, dangling breasts and her scaly vagina, slick and wet.
The Riverwench opened her mouth and said, “You dare to burn down my home, insects?”
“Says the one eating people left and right!” Gatril replied.
The Riverwench snarled. “I’ll devour you and turn you into dung!”
Kiran set the orbs on his staff alight. “Gatril, shoot when you have an opening!” Kiran charged ahead. He tapped his staff and raised a column of earth. 
The Riverwench smashed it with her arm and dove after Kiran. The human leaped out of the way and rolled onto his feet, immediately unleashing consecutive concussive blasts. But they only staggered the beast and enraged her.
