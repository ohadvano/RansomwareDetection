“Morning Alice, did you sleep well?”
She grabs the steaming kettle and pours the hot water into three mugs.
I smile as I make my way to the table. “Morning Sally. I actually slept better than I thought I would.”
I cross my arms on the table and look out towards the window.
“Sam should be down in a minute. She's probably trying to decide what to wear to school.”
Sally brings a mug of tea over and places it in front of me.
I thank her and place my hands around the hot mug to keep my hands nice and warm.
Sally also brings over a plate with butter covered toast to the table and sits down next to me. “How's things at home? Your mom doing okay?” She grabs a little plate from the middle of the table and takes a piece of toast.
Things at home have been kinda strange since recent events. Before being bitten, I never once had a boy over at my house, let alone having four shapeshifters in my living room.
