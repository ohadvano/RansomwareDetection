“Of course,” said Gatril. “I’m close to where Kiran lives. He can always visit us.”
Then Shirksire’s elation dwindled when she realized something. “…But my books…There are a lot of them.”
“If you’ve ready read them, then you don’t need them anymore,” said Kiran. “If you were trying to learn magic, they obviously weren’t helpful.”
Shirksire smiled. “Your offer does sound tempting. I must considerate, though.”
“No problem,” said Kiran, getting up. “Now let’s see if this works…”
Kiran channeled his spirit energy into the staff and pointed to the gun next to Gatril. A thick strand of silk spewed from the orb and attached to the weapon, and Karin yanked it towards him and caught it.
“A web…” Shirksire remarked.
“Just in case I can’t reach something from where I am,” said Kiran. “So, shall we all leave? This cave is getting a bit cramped now.”
Shirksire got up. “Right this way…”
Shirksire lead them to out of the cave into the ruins of the town, where the male spiders awaiting them, peering from atop the buildings and inside through the windows. However, any thoughts of making an attack on the human and bosdrake where stalled by the presence of their female.
“What will you do about them?” said Gatril as she walked by the arachnids.
“I’ll still keep them around as a deterrent from travelers,” Shirksire said, watching Kiran hurry towards his quacycle and check for any damages. 
The sun was setting in the distance, and long shadows were strewn from the trees across the ground. The air was cool, and Kiran felt relaxed now that his entire mission was complete. When they were out on the highway, Kiran and Gatril faced Shirksire, about to say their final goodbyes.
“When will you be back?” said Shirksire.
“Within a month’s time, after the tournament is finished,” said Kiran. “If I get my sorcerer’s license, I can keep beasts…or ferrans as my pets. In this case, you would be my partner. It means you could walk amongst human’s freely without any persecution. Then we can study new magic together.”
Shirksire smiled. “I like the sound of that.” She knelt over Kiran, held his cheeks and kissed him on his forehead. “I’ll be seeing you, Kiran…”
“You too, Shirksire,” said the young man.
“We should get going,” said Gatril. “bultungins usually get active at night. And we already pissed off a gang of them.”
Kiran and Gatril got on the quacycle and rode off, while Shirksire walked back to the town. 
“Well,” said Gatril, “you’ve acquired all your spells, young sorcerer. I guess you only need to prepare for your grand debut at the tournament.”
Kiran said, “Yeah, but that’s only the first part. After that I’ll need to raise money doing a lot of missions. I still remember my promise to carry you to Puzzland. And I want to discover different magical artifacts on the uncharted continents.”
Gatril’s arms slinked around Kiran affectionately. “Do you think we can say we are boyfriend and girlfriend now?”
“That’s if you mind sharing,” said Kiran. “The uncharted worlds are really dangerous, so I’ll need as much support as I can get. I think I really will each Shirksire how to use magic. Heck, maybe all the other girls can join me.”
“So long as you eat my crotch the most, I don’t mind,” said Gatril.
Kiran looked over his shoulder at Gatril, and said, “Don’t worry, you’ll always be my main girl.”
Gatril’s mouth was slightly ajar, and she closed it. She smiled at Kiran and kissed his cheek. 
Kiran turned his attention back to the road, grinning. Have I got a story for you, grandpa.

CHAPTER ONE

After several months of preparation, now came Kiran’s time to prove his worth. Dressed in a red tunic adorned in golden swirls on the hems, and grey trousers beneath, he carefully crept through the lush bushes in search of his target. Apart from a compact, metal cannon in a bronze frame, Kiran had a knapsack on his back with his various necessities inside, along with a staff he placed through a strap on his bag.
Most of the sunlight was hidden by the thickness of the jungle’s trees, and Kiran had to rely on the effectiveness of his eyes. The parts of the soil present had a sandy tone and texture, however Kiran was more focused on following the footprints of his prey. He occasionally looked up to see his surroundings, knowing he was not the only one out here on the hunt.
Focus, Kiran, he thought. This is your only chance.
Kiran, at sixteen years old, needed to obtain a special ingredient in order to start preparing the spells for the tournament, and that vital ingredient he needed, was right before him nibbling on a few fallen mangos.
Among all the beasts on the continent of Aardel, bosdrakes were one of the rarest. They were few in numbers, and said to only lay ten eggs every twenty years. Some said it was a curse from the gods as a means of curving the rise in numbers of the powerful creatures, but the bosdrakes never were the type to tell.
The typical bosdrake was ten meters tall from head to toe, with a thick tail half its height, capable of levelling small trees in one swing. But the one before Kiran was around five feet tall, fairly young. It had yellow skin and a stocky build, it’s thick arms and legs ending in four digits with large talons. It had a large head with a blunt snout, and its eyes were bright green and its mouth wide. The bosdrake had two rows of orange studs on its head that ran all the way down to its tail that coiled against its back, with green hair set in a drooping mohawk—unlike Kiran’s hair was braided into ten individual locks. This bosdrake in particular also wore a necklace of red and copper stones and square wood carvings.
Besides the smoothness of its jaw and the eyelashes, Kiran could tell it was a female by its exposed genitals; a plump labia with dark lips and round breasts. The sight of it caused blood to rush down Kiran’s groin, and he had to briefly pause and wait till his thoughts settled.
The bosdrake hummed a sweet tune as she sat on her bottom beneath the tree, entertaining her eyes with the swaying branches as she ate.
Now’s my chance! Kiran thought. He lifted his cannon and looked along the iron sight. Kiran made sure he had the bosdrake’s head in view, and pulled the trigger. The hammer struck, and the cannon bucked with a flash of smoke from the muzzle, releasing a ball the shape and size of a chicken egg.
But to Kiran’s horror, the bosdrake ducked, and the projectile struck a tree and exploded into a cloud of brown smoke. It was a concoction of chemicals with enough strength to knockout a fully-grown wildebeest.
“Oh no!” said Kiran as he punched the spent shell out of the side of the cannon. At the base of it was a cartridge that held four rounds, one of which he just wasted.
The bosdrake laughed mockingly as she got up and faced Kiran. The intensity of her glare caused him to flinch. “Amateur human!” she said. “You disguised your footsteps, but I smelt you coming a mile away. Hold your weapon!”
Kiran was about to point the weapon at her but he froze. That was when the bosdrake said, “Who are you? And what do you want with me?”
“M-My name is Kiran…” His voice was shaky, but nonetheless he bravely spoke. “I’m a sorcerer in training…and I’m looking for an ingredient for my next spell…”
“What kind of ingredient?” The bosdrake took four steps towards Kiran. The boy took four steps back. “Answer now you blasted human!”
Kiran swallowed a nervous lump. “…I need the queex of a bosdrake.”
The dragon gawked at Kiran. “What?” She was well aware of what “queex” was; the creamy vaginal fluid of any woman, possessing magical properties as a result of being influenced by their soul. “Oh, so you wanted to rape me, huh?”
“Wait! No!” said Kiran. “I was just going to knock you out and scrape out some of it!”
“Liar!” the bosdrake ran after Kiran, chasing him between the bushes and trees. Kiran attempted to point the cannon around him and fire, but his shot missed the bosdrake. She was running on all fours, and despite her slight chubbiness she was getting dangerously closer.
Kiran hurried clumsily down slope and served towards a path that lead out of the jungle. Just as Kiran found the grassy path, he felt the full weight of the bosdrake as she pounced upon him.
They rolled in a heap; Kiran trying to free himself from the bosdrake’s grasp while she tried to pin him down. Eventually her strength overpowered his, and she knelt over Kiran, smiling and bearing her sharp teeth.
“I’ve got you now, human,” she said.
“Please, let me go!” said Kiran.
“I’ll let you go…after I’ve bitten off that pretty nose of yours!” And the bosdrake opened her mouth wide enough that Kiran could see all forty of her teeth. 
He screamed and closed his eyes. “Doooooon’t!”
Kiran saw his whole life flash before his eyes, and as his body tensed in preparation for his end. But nothing came. 
Reluctantly, Kiran opened his eyes one by one, seeing the bosdrake looking at him impatiently. After he caught his breath, Kiran said, “You’re...not going to eat me?”
“No,” said the bosdrake, getting off the young man. “Human’s taste awful.” She walked over to the cannon on the ground and picked it up.
Kiran scurried to his feet. “…Why?”
The bosdrake abruptly smashed the cannon over her knee. Kiran yelp in disbelief. He ran over to the two piece and took them up. “My cannon!” He held the objects dejectedly in his hands. He looked at the beast. “You broke my cannon!”
“Would you have preferred If I broke your neck instead?” said the bosdrake staunchly.
Kiran imaged the horror of his vertebrae snapping like a twig, and suddenly looked at the pieces of his weapon as if they were nothing. “Awww blast…” He tossed the parts away. “Now I’ll never get the queex I want.”
The bosdrake, sensing no killing intent from the human, felt comfortable enough to ask, “What do you need my queex for?”
Kiran regarded her with a baffled stare. “I told, I need it for a spell?”
“You’re a wizard?” said the bosdrake.
“Uh…yes…yes I am…” The conversation felt too alien for the young boy. “Excuse me…miss bosdrake—”
“My name is Gatril,” said the reptile.
“Oh, okay,” said Kiran. Wow, am I really talking with a dragon? “Why are you asking about my profession all of a sudden…Gatril?”
The bosdrake suddenly sat on her bottom, partially opened her legs and gave Kiran a peak at her vagina. Gatril yawned and said, “I’m curious as to why you wanted to hunt me down, human. And you would do good to remember I spared your life out of courtesy, so it’s in your best interest to answer my questions.”
Kiran sighed. “Okay…fine…” His best chance of getting out of this alive was to just play along. But he was proud of himself. He was handling the situation better than he thought, for he had not soiled his pants yet. “The Witching Tournament is held three years in different countries. I’m trying to qualify for this year’s tournament, but I need special animal parts to perform my spells.”
“And that’s why you were going to capture me and rape me?” said Gatril.
“What? No!” Kiran waved his hands dismissively. “I wasn’t gonna rape you! That’s terrible! I’m still a virgin!”
“Then how did you plan on getting my queex?” said Gatril. “In order to get my queex you would’ve had to stimulate me so I can orgasm.”
Kiran nervously rubbed his hands together. “Well,” he looked at a stone on the ground, “I was planning to use my fingers.”
Gatril’s eyes lit up. “Really?” She noticed the key words in his statements, and painted a picture of the young man. “Do you live with your parents, boy? What’s your name?”
“My name is Kiran,” he said. “My father works at a carpeting company. My mother’s a farmer.”
Gatril sat forward, regarding Kiran with intense inhuman eyes that arouse more of his unease. “You sound like a well-off boy, Kiran?”
“Kinda,” he said. “How would you know about human jobs?”
Gatril chuckled. “Do you think you’re the first human I’ve met. For as long as I can remember humans have been coming in contact with beasts. Most hunt us down for our power. Only a very rare few treat us with compassion.”
Kiran hung his head, his eyes losing the willingness to look at Gatril. “I’m sorry,” he said. “This was my first-time hunting anything—anyone. I didn’t know what to do.”
Gatril slowly rose and approached Kiran. He didn’t run, not that he could out-speed her anyway. But he didn’t seem startled. Gatril looked him up and down quizzically. He seems firmly built, she thought. Well, he is a farm boy.
“So are you going to kill me now?” Kiran said.
Gatril shook her head. “No.” She ran her fingers across his cheek, feeling the warmth of his flesh. “I’ve decided I’m going to have some fun with you.”
Kiran arched his spine upon feeling a tingling sensation. “What kind of fun are you talking about?”
Gatril, wearing a fleshy smile, said, “I knew a human once. A man. He was, interesting. I want to see if you can take his place. Meet me here tomorrow at the same time. I’ll help you with your spells.”
“R-Really?” said Kiran, unable to hide his excitement. “I mean…you’re not afraid I’ll just runaway and never comeback?”
“Oh, you’ll return,” said Gatril. “A responsible sorcerer wouldn’t let an opportunity like this pass, would he?”
“No, I wouldn’t!” Kiran’s smile was big and toothy. “Oh wow! Thank you!”
“Stop kissing my ass and go home and get ready,” said Gatril, “we have a long day ahead of us tomorrow.”
Kiran hurriedly took up the parts of his cannon and clutched them under his arms. He gave Gatril one last glance before he hurried to the edge of the jungle.
As promised, Kiran returned the next day. The jungle itself was fifty acres, surrounded by the town on both sides with only a river at the north and south that connected it to distant jungles and forests within the country of Tatanui.
Kiran’s method of transport was a quacycle, a four-wheeled vehicle with a large seat and trolley at the back as the main centerpiece, held within a metal. It also had a large steam engine beneath it, with exhaust pipes jutting out the back.
It was sixty years ago since the world was plunged into the industrial revolution, and small engines like these were becoming widely marketed. Kiran just got his for his sixteenth birthday from his parents, albeit he had to put up some of the money from the odd jobs he was doing through the town; paperboy, yard sweeper, fruit picker and stable boy.
But it was having to put himself through such tasks that gave Kiran joy in his quacycle, and he scribbled his name all over the vehicle and decorated it with red paint and small banners of symbols of the arcane
Kiran stopped a few yards inside the jungle and switched a knob near the steering wheel, turning off the engine. He tied it to a tree with a lock and key and took his knapsack out of the cart. He had hastily repaired his cannon yesterday, only needing to weld the barrel back to the body. Now his focus was on accomplishing his first spell with Gatril’s help.
With giddiness Kiran jogged through the trees with his staff in hand and cannon and knapsack slung across his back. In the distance he spotted a small herd of deer grazing, when they suddenly popped their heads up and looked at him.
Expecting them to run away from the potential predator, one of the deer’s head snapped to the side, an arrow stuck in its eye. 
Kiran yelped and dove behind a tree. The deer fell and the others scattered out of sight. Kiran reached for his cannon in preparation for a potential conflict, when he saw the culprit who had fired the projectile in the skull of the herbivore.
They were diminutive, noisy, painted their pale skin on the chests and shoulders and wore clothing of simple loin clothes over their genitals. All these were the traits of a typical a batoiko. They were a group of people of only four feet in height, who also wore masks with hollow eyes and horrible expressions of tortured faces. They were made up of different tribes, seven of which lived within the country of Tatanui. 
They chattered around the dead deer with spears and knives in hand. One of them with a bow kicked the corpse of the animal. Met with no response, the male batoiko leaped onto the carcass and shouted in a garbled tongue. The other men and women shouted with the same synergy. 
Kiran doubted the excitement was due to this being their first kill, and rather their relish of the act. But he wasn’t going to stick around to see if they liked hunting people as well. He was well aware of the batoiko’s existence in the jungle, which was another reason why he brought along his weapon.
With a rehearsed pace the batoiko lifted the deer over the heads of four of them and hurried off out of sight. But one of them, a female by the proportions of the body and the small, bulging breasts, lingered behind.
Kiran folded behind the tree before she could look in his direction. The boy held his breath, and to how hard his heart was beating in his chest, wished he could silence it too before the batoiko heard him.
Seconds passed by, but Kiran didn’t dare look from around his hiding place. Then he heard the footsteps in the leaf litter plow away. When Kiran was certain he couldn’t hear the footsteps anymore, he cautiously peeped from behind the tree. 
And as Kiran walked from behind his cover, the batoiko fell from the tree upon him, dropping Kiran with a blow to his shoulder.
Kiran yelped and reflexively pulled the trigger. A round exploded against the base of a tree. Kiran rolled over and was greeted by the female’s crude looking mass and mane of hay around it. He screamed and brought the butt of his gun across the batoiko’s face, but the female pulled away.
She wrestled the weapon from Kiran with a startling strength and pulled a knife from the waist of her skirt. Excited, strange words rolled off her tongue as she lifted the blade.
“No!” Kiran crossed his arms over his head and clamped his eyes shut.
And Gatril leaped onto the batoiko like a lion, having been alerted to Kiran’s smell. The female failed to react in time as Gatril bit down on her shoulder, spun with her and tossed her aside.
The woman kicked up leaves as she rolled across the ground. She screamed choppy words and sprung onto her feet. She spotted what attacked her, and like a predator over its kill, Gatril stood on all fours over Kiran, her breasts dangling tantalizingly over his face.
Gatril made a snarl that shook the air around her, and having gotten the message, the batoiko woman squeaked and ran off.
“Little insects…” Gatril sneered.
Gatril looked down at the human and crawled off him. Kiran sprung up and reached for his cannon. “Th-Thank you!” he said, trying to catch his breath.
But Gatril’s face repelled his thanks with an irked frown. “You really are a clumsy weak human. This is the second time you almost got killed out here.”
Kiran dusted the leaves off him. “I’m sorry, Gatril! I’m not really a fighter like that.”
“Yes,” said Gatril, “a deer with apples on its feet is more like it.” Kiran frowned at her, but the dragon was unperturbed. “Just follow me.” And Gatril walked away.
Kiran trailed behind Gatril, mindful of her undulating tail and the possible other threats lying in wait for them. It wasn’t long before Gatril brought them upon her home. Kiran had been expecting from the stories his grandfather told him about dragons a tunnel leading to a massive cavern filled to the brim with treasures collected from around the world. 
This wasn’t the case.
The mass of branches bent and folded around four trees, covered by a layer of large leaves knitted together. The scene managed to spark both disappointment and intrigue in Kiran. “This is where you live?” he said.
“Yes,” said Gatril. “Wonderful, isn’t it?”
Kiran studied the finer details of the construction, noting that it resembled a dome somewhat, along with wooden posts that made up the frame. The inside had two straw beds, the second Gatril had prepared the previous night. Lighting was provided by holes in the walls, covered by large leaves. 
Gatril gestured to one of the beds. “Sit.”
“Umm…” Kiran carefully seated himself, looking across at the bosdrake on her own bed.
“So,” said Gatril, “Kiran, let me see what you’ve got.”
Kiran took out jars, scalpels, tiny prongs, his lunch and a book out of his bag and laid them on the floor. Beside the book, he put everything else aside, and opened the text. “This is a book of all spells that can be easily done with animal parts,” he said.
Gatril took the book and looked through the first five pages. She put it down and said, “But you know in order to do spells, you have to be able to use your spirit energy?”
Kiran replied with a sly grin. He opened his palm. His forehead furrowed with concentration, and he produced a faint white light in his hand. “I already learned it. My grandfather taught me.”
Gatril’s face puckered. She hadn’t been expecting this level of commitment from the boy. “That’s impressive,” she said. “Accessing one’s spiritual energy can’t be done by just anyone. You and your grandfather seem to have latent talent for it.”
“We do,” he said. “My father’s side comes from a long line of sorcerers and witches. My grandfather, when he was younger, he failed to slay a wyvern that was terrorizing a town. He was ashamed and forced himself into retirement. His name as a wizard wasn’t good anymore. That’s why his son, my father, took on carpeting as a profession. But I want to become a sorcerer just like we used to be.”  Kiran dispelled the light from him hand and relaxed. “So, like…how are we going to start this?” Kiran took out a smooth ovoid object and some water. “I’d brought these to…you know…” and Kiran made a thrusting motion with the object.
Gatril slapped the objects from Kiran’s hands. Kiran flinched, forming a pout as he stared at her. “Rubbish! Is that how you intend to get what you want?”
Kiran nervously rubbed his neck. “Well I don’t know how else.”
“You’ve never had sex before, you said?” Gatril said.
“Nope,” said Kiran. “Not with a human or a beast.”
“Hmm,” said Gatril. “I guess you’re not a sexplorer then.”
“A what?” Kiran said.
“Sexplorers,” said Gatril. “They’re humans who travel the world with the goal of having sex with rare and exotic people and monsters. They’re mostly men, though you have a few horny women who do it too.”
“Wow,” Kiran said. “That’s really perverted. Have you ever met one?”
“Once,” said Gatril. “He was a foreigner. He was a nice man. But he was a rarity. Sexplorers are usually rapists. Some even kill and eat the monsters they have sex with.”
Something ran up Kiran’s back and made him shudder. “Well, I’m not like that! I just want ingredients for my spells.”
“Just my queex, right?” Gatril crept closer to Kiran. She sunk her finger into her crotch and stirred the center. Kiran’s body jittered, and blood flooded his crotch. “If you want my queex, young sorcerer, there’s only one way to get it.”
Kiran’s mouth opened and a hissing exhaled came out. He couldn’t take his eyes off Gatril’s vagina as she spread the lips of it and stuck her finger inside. “I’ve never done this before…” he repeated.
“Don’t worry,” said Gatril. “I’ll show you.” She took her hand from between her legs and brought it to Kiran’s nose, jarring him with the pungent smell of fresh onion and roasted turkey. She stuck her fingers in the boy’s mouth, tickling his tongue with them. Kiran savored the taste, and his penis throbbed rhythmically.
Gatril took her fingers out of his mouth as she smiled mischievously. “If you want a woman’s queex, you must do it the right way.”
Gatril laid on her back and opened her legs. “Come, young sorcerer.”
This is it now, Kiran thought as he bent over and grabbed her thighs. This is how I lose my virginity. Well, It’s not like she’s ugly. I guess I just have to enjoy the ride.
Kiran took a deep sniff, absorbing the fragrance in his lungs. He tickled her vulva with his tongue, sending electrifying ripples up her stomach. She grabbed his breasts of if the hold her body steady. Kiran wagged his tongue inside her until he found the bud of flesh. With long, deep strokes of his muscular appendage Kiran produced more stimulation. Gatril uttered soft moans and closed her eyes, kneading her breast to assuage the overwhelming desire for satisfaction within her. All the while Kiran’s penis throbbed painfully, yearning for its own release.
Gatril got moister inside. “…Yes…that’s a good boy…”
Kiran lapped up the fluids, still going further and further. Minutes passed and the sensation grew stronger inside Gatril along with her moans. Her body writhed as the contracting waves between her legs strengthened.
“Kiran…I think…I think I feel it cumming!”
Kiran reached for a bowl and placed it beneath her. He made strong sucking motions, until finally she came.
The discharge was equivalent to a burst artery, spewing a huge amount of strong smelling, viscous fluid into Kiran’s mouth. He quickly spat it into the bowl along with the rest that poured from her.
The small bowl was filled halfway, but more than what Kiran was expecting. “Whoa!” he said.
Gatril relaxed and caught her breath. She became so comfortable that she almost went to sleep. But there was more to be done. 
She got up and exhaled. “Phew! Okay. Now it’s my turn.” Gatril went on her hands and knees, exposing her rear to the boy. 
Kiran’s face lit up gloriously, and he went and caressed her rump, giving it soft kisses. He licked the excess wetness from between her ass and buried his face in it. 
“Hurry up,” said Gatril. 
“Y-Yeah.” Kiran stooped, leveling his waist with her bottom. Gatril bent her tail over her back to allow him ease of access. Kiran pulled back the foreskin of his manhood and bumped the tip against Gatril, feeling her muscles tense just a little.
“Slowly now,” Gatril giggled. “You might hurt yourself.”
Kiran slowly entered her, feeling the squeeze of Gatril’s warm wetness. He winced and moaned softly. 
“Good work,” said Gatril. “You’re no longer a virgin. Now, start pounding. Slowly.”
Kiran cocked back his hip and swung inward, delivering his first thrust; a brief burst of sweetness. Kiran continued to do so until Gatril sunk into the flow of things, closing her eyes and moaning along with her human consort.
As the minutes passed, Kiran increased his speed and power. Both he and Gatril winced and clenched their fists.
“That’s it!” she said. “Faster…faster…”
Kiran closed his eyes as his moans grew louder, and before he knew it, he pulled out, spurting a thick jet of white fluid over Gatril’s head and onto the wall. He let out a deep, long sigh. Kiran’s body shuddered spasmodically. The painful throbs had become pleasurable contractions that dripped his semen each time.
Gatril lay on her chest and crossed her arms beneath her head. Kiran staggered to his feet, careful not to trip over his belongings. He sat back against the wall and wiped the tip of his penis, folding it back into his pants. “That was amazing!”
Gatril lifted her head, rolled on her back and sat up. “Not bad for your first time. Especially your tongue.”
Kiran blushed and looked away. “A few prostitutes live near me. They used to talk about how they like it to be done.”
“Really?” Gatril laughed. “I can’t believe it. Just word of mouth thought you? You’re a really good listener.”
Kiran got up, looking down at Gatril as if he knew her all along. “So,” Kiran was a bit hesitant with his words, “what does this make us now?”
“Hmm. Let’s just leave it at friends with benefits,” said Gatril.
Kiran nodded. “Yeah. Sure.” He looked around at the floor. “Well, I better start working on my spell now.”
While Gatril wiped herself, Kiran took the bowl and poured its contents into a clear jar. He took up two other jars and fetched the spell book. Along with the vaginal fluids of a bosdrake, he needed a little sulphur and powdered mango seed. Once he got the substances together, Kiran mixed them around in the jar.
Gatril sat and watched Kiran at work, wondering who his grandfather was, and also about Kiran’s profession and future. Not many beasts had the opportunity to see the intricacies of how humans developed their society.
When the queex began to take on a gelatinous form, Kiran took it out of the jar and placed it in his hands. He rolled it together until it hardened into a white, discolored orb.
“Got it!” Kiran said.
“What will you do with that?” said Gatril.
“Just watch…” Kiran’s movements were bouncy. He took up his staff and quickly carved a space at the top that he filled with glue. He placed the orb into it and waited for it to dry.
Kiran sprung to his feet, his pants still stained with semen and vaginal fluids. “It’s ready!”
Gatril got up. “Good. Now we can see what all that sex was for.”
Gatril followed him outside, squinting a little from the sunlight. Kiran looked around and found a large stone. He summoned forth his spirit energy and channeled it into the staff. “Okay Gatril, watch closely.”
“I am you little rascal,” she said.
Kiran tossed the rock. As the object fell, he channeled his energy into the orb in the staff. A shockwave snapped from it and hit the rock, sending it flying into the bushes like a missile. Kiran leaped and punched the air. “Yes! It worked!”
Smiling, Gatril said, “Congratulations.” She scratched her cheek. “What the hell was that anyway?”
Kiran said, “It was a basic force-counter spell. It produces a blast of kinetic energy that can repel objects of a certain size. Anything the size of a man will be sent flying.”
“Neat trick,” she said. Gatril swayed her tail as she assessed the situation. “So this competition that you’re going to enter, what else does it have?”
Kiran proudly stood with the staff before him like a cane. “We’re supposed to complete three trials, then face off against each other in the finals. The successful ten contestants will be chosen to serve on the Grand Magic Council, or as aids to nobles and the king. I need to create five spells, so I need the queex of five beasts.”
Gatril frowned. “Five beasts? Their queex? Really? Are you sure it’s not just an excuse for you to have sex with beasts?
Kiran dropped his staff and franticly waved his hands. “No! No! I swear!” He pointed back into the hut. “The spells I want require those specific parts! Honest!”
Gatril narrowed her emerald eyes at the human. “Hmmm. And you say I was the first?”
Kiran nodded. “Yeah! I-I was going about it by order. First there’s you; a bosdrake, then a lamia, a selkie, popobawa and a j’bafofi.”
Gatril became visibly shaken. “A j’bafofi? That monster feeds on humans and other beasts alike. They aren’t as negotiable as I am.”
Kiran gave her a firm nod. “Indeed. And I need one for a strong spell. A wizard must be willing to go to the furthest lengths both physically and mentally, to achieve their desired magic. That’s what my grandfather taught me.”
“Your grandfather is a madman,” said Gatril. “You’ll die if you go there all on your own.”
“Well…” Kiran hugged Gatril around her waist. “I won’t be all by myself, now that I have a friend.”
Gatril gave Kiran and incredulous look. “What makes you think I’ll help you, human? I’m quite fine here in this forest. I can eat sleep, and have sex with the occasional beast, or batoiko that wanders off from his tribe…”
Gatril trailed off when Kiran smiled even harder at her. “Aww,” he said. “I see, so you’re a bit of a sexplorer yourself. Must’ve picked up a thing or two from the that human you were talking about.”
Her cover blown, Gatril said, “Yeah whatever. And your point is?”
“Then come with me,” Kiran said. “You and I can have lots of sex, now that my virginity isn’t weighing me down.”
Indeed, the prospect was tantalizing to the bosdrake, but her instincts had to consider the possible dangers that would be out there along their possible journey. “This continent has five kingdoms,” she said. “Between them are scattered clans and villages that war and trade with each other at times. If it were not for some villages pledging allegiance to these kingdoms with taxes in order for protection, these places would be in chaos. Not only will you have to worry about monsters, but humans are notorious for being capable of horrible things.”
“My parents already understand,” said Kiran. “My father already has two other sons besides me to carry on his name, and help in the carpentry business. He doesn’t hate me, but he doesn’t like that I took on his father’s profession. He says those are for the old days of witch doctors—that medicine has come far along with the sciences. But this world—it still has magic. I want to be a part of those old days of legends.”
Gatril heard the resolve in the young man’s voice and began to reconstruct her previous assumption. Perhaps he was more than just a stiff cock for her to sit on when she was in heat. “Fine, Kiran the sorcerer. I accept your request. However, I have a few conditions.”
“Sure,” Kiran said, “what did you have in mind?”
“First, I like my crotch licked,” Gatril said, “so you’ll have to be willing to give more than I will for you.”
Kiran nodded. “Okay.”
“Second,” Gatril continued, “assuming you’ll be fighting monsters, you’ll need my assistance. Henceforth, I’ll need to eat the best food money can buy, or we can hunt.”
Kiran nodded.
“And third,” said Gatril, “I wish to go to Lemuria.”
Kiran nodded on practice, then instantly gaped at the bosdrake when he realized what she said. “Huh? Lemuria…you mean one of the uncharted continents?”
“You heard me,” Gatril said. “I want to discover what grate foods lie there. However, the only port that exists there is own by humans, so I would need a human escort.”
“Um,” Kiran scratched his head. “Sure, but why do you want to venture so far all of a sudden?”
“Do you think humans are the only ones who like adventure?” said Gatril. “You presume beasts like to live in trees, caves and huts. We like material things as well, you know.”
“Okay,” said Kiran. “I can understand that. So, I’ve agreed to all your demands.” Kiran looked over Gatril and raised his hand halfway. “Do we shake on it or…”
Gatril presented the tip of her tail to Kiran. “Kiss it.”
“What?” he said.
“Kiss it,” she replied. “It will be proof of our allegiance.”
Kiran sighed. “You know, I think you’re getting back at me for trying to capture you.”
“Yes, actually,” Gatril retorted.
Kiran shrugged, and kissed her tail.

CHAPTER TWO

Kiran took three days to prepare for his journey, gathering clothes, food, weapons and the items necessary for crafting his spells. His home was situated in a large town of cottages composed of wood and concrete, broken up my many paved streets with those being bare earth in the communities.
Kiran pushed his quacycle through his front yard and out the gate. Just as he turned to close it, he saw his mother and father walking out of the house. His father had on leathery overall made from the skin of a buffalo, stained with grease and other unknown substances. His mother wore a simple blue frock and beneath her messy apron. 
“When will you be coming back?” his mother said, her round face looking perturbed.
“In about two weeks,” Kiran said. “I’ll need to register for the tournament soon.”
“So long?” she retorted. “Your allowance won’t last all that time, you know.”
“Don’t worry,” Kiran said, “I can find some jobs around the villages if I need to.”
“Do you have your ID Kiran?” his father said.
“I do, dad.” Kiran took it out of his pocket and held it up for them to see. It was a pass-card was a translucent piece of material with one’s name, address and their fingerprint. 
“Good,” the man said. “Be sure to stay out of trouble.”
“Yessir,” Kiran said.
His mother waved at him. “Be careful dear! And good luck!”
Kiran waved back and hopped onto his vehicle, pedaling off down the road. Passing through his community he saw the brothel where visitors to the town frequented, as well as bars and various workshops. The hospital along with the police department and the village headman’s office was in the town square, but Kiran took his journey closer to the eastern outskirts of the village where the jungle was.
Reaching the lonely path again, Karin turned into the forest. Yet, he didn’t need to go far, as Gatril was there waiting on him, sitting wearing a loincloth over her privates and a bra of matted leaves. She had a small pouch tied around her waist as well, and munched on a handful on fruits.
Kiran parked his vehicle and approached her. “I see you’re all set.”
Gatril swallowed and said, “Hmph. You brought a lot of stuff with you. I hope you have food.”
“I do,” he said. “You sure do eat a lot.
“Bosdrakes don’t like going anywhere on an empty stomach,” said Gatril. “And we expend a lot of energy during fights.”
Kiran shrugged lightly. “Okay. So, our first mission is finding a lamia!”
Gatril swallowed her last bit of food and said, “Those are a bit bigger than I am.”
Kiran took a book from out of his backpack and flipping through the pages. “I know. I have a bestiary.” Kiran held the book up so she could see. Gatril saw the image of a coiled serpent with arms, legs and a human-like head and neck. Beneath it were some notes about the creature, it’s diet and habitat.
Gatril made a thoughtful hum. “These books aren’t always accurate. Sometimes the monsters’ behavior may change along with their environment.”
“Well that’s what you’re here to help with.” Kiran put away the book. “Anyways, we should get started.”
Kiran hopped onto his quacycle and gestured to a space behind him. Gatril carefully climbed on and held onto Kiran’s waist. “I’ve never rode one of these things before.”
“Don’t worry,” Kiran said. “I’m an expert.”
“…Why don’t I feel confident in what you’re saying?” Gatril said dryly.
Kiran chuckled and turned on the engine. Steam spewed from the tubes, and he rode out of the city of trees. 
It wasn’t uncommon for monsters to be seen outside of their wild habitats, however people took care to avoid the beasts, even though they possessed the intelligence to communicate. Kiran and Gatril left the thinning jungle and came upon a small grassy plain, inhabited by gazelles, wild boars and zebras.
Gatril licked her lips as she seized up the animals. “I could eat one of those right now…”
“Focus,” said Kiran. “We need to keep an eye out for predators too.”
“That’s what I’m doing,” Gatril said. “Don’t start lecturing me, human. Beasts know more about the wild than any man.”
Kiran rolled his eyes and acquiesced to her statement. Then, within his fied of vision, Kiran caught something in the distance, and pointed to it. “Look over there!”
Gatril turned her gaze towards the west, where in the distance she could make out a cluster of tall buildings, almost hidden beneath the looming mountains. “That’s Cronbark,” she said. “It’s one of the cities in the Tatanui kingdom, isn’t it?”
“Yeah,” said Kiran, looking aspiringly at the constructs. “That’s where I’ll go and register once I’ve gathered my spells.” He giggled. “I can’t wait!”
It was over two hours later when they finally made it to their destination; a plain of bare earth covered in scattered bushes, trees and rocks. This allowed for loose soil, the perfect kind for a lamia to burrow through
Kiran said, “Here we are,” and he and Gatril got off their transport. Kiran parked the quacycle near a tree under the shade, then checked his cannon once more, as well as the ammunitions. He fitted his staff in the small sheath on his backpack as well as the necessary jars from the trolley inside it.
After watching him go through all of this, Gatril said, “So how do you plan on tracking down the lamia?”
“Well,” Kiran hesitated for a while, “Lamia are beasts, so they have human intelligence, but still live like animals. It’s a reptile, so it needs to be somewhere cool to bring down its metabolism.”
“You’re almost correct,” said Gatril. “When hunting beasts, you should take care to study what they like. Lamia of a young age can’t breed as yet, so they don’t produce much queex. They love to eat rabbits, deer, wild boars and humans. Humans don’t have fur, scales, feathers, horns or claws, so they’re easier to swallow. They usually come to the surface to warm up, because they’re cold blooded, unlike us bosdrakes. That’s when they’re most vulnerable.”
“Sure,” said Kiran. “So it's best to look for them in the day?”
“Yes,” Gatril said. “Midday to be exact. A lamia will usually climb high out of reach to get warm before slithering back into its burrow.”
“Then we just wait until the sun’s high in the sky before we search then,” Kiran said.
Gatril said, “Right. And in the meantime,” she lifted her skirt, exposing her wet vagina, “let’s have some fun with that mouth of yours.”

After having pleasure Gatril, she and Kiran found themselves a tree to climb and get a wider view of their surroundings. While Kiran looked from pair of binoculars, Gatril used her sharp eyes to scoured the land for any sign of their target.
Apart from the grazing animals and a pack of wild dogs that had marched by, they spotted nothing close to what they were after. Even after it had past twelve in the afternoon, and the sun scorched everything below, the pair didn’t see a hint of a lamia. 
But an hour later, their patience was rewarded.
“I see it…” said Kiran, smiling brightly.
“I see one too,” said Gatril.
In Kiran’s sight he saw the long, dark green body of something slithering across the ground. Then it suddenly reared up on its thick legs and trotted towards a tree. The one Gatril looked at had a color closer to brown, making its way towards a rock. 
“How can we tell the gender?” said Kiran. “I need the queex specifically.”
“Just look at the face,” said Gatril. “But I can also tell by smell. These are both male. Males usually share the same territory, travelling in gangs. Females live by themselves, so we should look elsewhere.”
“Okay,” said Kiran.
They both waited until a few more males came out, scattered around the plain, until they got down and made for the quacycle. They were about to get on their transportation when something sped out of the bushes at them. A massive leopard.
Kiran screamed and fumbled for his gun, but his dragon companion roared and launched herself into the ferocious feline. They growled and snarled as they tousled on the ground in a heap of thrashing limbs and tails, trying to find a mortal opening on the other as Kiran frantically tried to find a chance for himself to take a shot. Finally Gatril’s jaws found the leopard’s neck and she sank her teeth into its flesh.
Blood ran from the wound, and the leopard’s flailing grew less intense. Gatril stood and wiped her mouth. The big cat was dead on the ground. 
“Are you alright?” Kiran said. 
Gatril knelt over the leopard and inspected it. “I’m fine,” she said. She took out her knife and began cutting open the cat. Kiran saw the scratches on her skin, but little blood. Dragon skin was known for being very resistant after all.
“What are you doing?” Kiran said.
“Can’t let meat go to waste,” she said, ripping out the leopard’s heart and liver. These she ate on the spot, and peeled the leopard’s skin off and carve off huge hunks of meat. She wrapped them in the skin and stood. The process itself took only a few minutes. “Let’s leave before more predators come after us.”
They rode away from the carcass and through the plain once more, their eyes and ears warier of the predators. This allowed Gatril to identify a clan of prowling hyenas and instruct Kiran to ride around them. 
Kiran and Gatril came to another tree where they made their second stop. This one was close to a nearby cluster of trees and bushes and a very small watering hole.
They climbed the tree and surveyed the land once more. Their wait wasn’t long, and Gatril saw it. Saw her first. It came out of the brush, slithering across the ground with a slick and shiny grey body with bands of black. Her face had a blunt nose, and thin lips rimming her wide mouth. Her eyes were bright yellow with long lashes, and around her head was stringy brown hair. She leisurely coiled her body atop a rock, resting her head across her folded arms. 
Gatril tapped Kiran for his attention, and gestured to the lamia. Kiran observed the beast through his binocular and grinned excitedly. “Great! I have her!”
Gatril nudged him. “Keep your voice down”
“Sorry,” Kiran said. “So how do we get it from her? I wanted to subdue her with some glue rounds. But maybe that would get her riled up.”
“I’ll try to give her a talk,” Gatril said.
“Really?” replied Kiran.
“Beasts such as ourselves have respect for each other you know,” said Gatril. “If you were to go, she would most likely eat you on the spot. Just give me a moment.”
Gatril climbed down the tree and approached the massive serpent. Kiran watched in the distance as the lamia raised her head at the bosdrake. He saw their mouths moving, but he couldn’t hear their words. At one point Gatril gestured in his direction and the snake turned its head his way. 
Then Gatril turned to the tree and waved at Kiran.
Kiran took a deep breath and relaxed. He climbed down the tree with his gear towards the two reptilians.
Upon nearing the lamia, Kiran could see more of her in detail, and realized that her huge, muscular body could easily crush him to a pulp.
“Here he is,” said Gatril, playfully pushing Kiran to the front. 
The serpent rose its upper body and unfolded her arms, revealing small breasts with pointed nipples. She hovered over Kiran, her pink tongue flashing from her mouth like lightning. She had a smell similar to wet soil, not unpleasant, but pungent, and it got Kiran wondering how her fluids would taste.
“So,” the serpent said, “this is the lowly human who wishes to get inside my womb?”
Kiran glanced over at Gatril and wondered what the bosdrake could’ve told the lamia. He brought his eyes back to the lamia and said, “My name is Kiran Kehomba. I’m a young sorcerer in training. Great serpent, I wish to receive some of your queex so I can complete a spell. I’m ready to do anything you desire.”
“Is that so?” she said. Half her body slithered off the rock and wound its way around Kiran. His muscles felt almost weak against her muscles, even though she was careful not to touch him. “What makes you think I need anything from a human, other than to put him in my stomach?”
Kiran’s said, “Well…besides eating, what else do you like, great serpent?”
“My name is Scalian,” she said.
“Yes. Right. Scalian.” Kiran looked at Gatril again, who urged him to go on. “Well Scalian, I can give you anything you want besides a human to eat. Like the best sex you ever had, for example?”
Scalian frowned. “…Is that all?”
Kiran fumed. He climbed out of her coils and stood a distance away. “Look here,” he said, “my plan was to attack you while you were sleeping, but I chose not to. I’m trying to be nice. Just stop being mysterious and tell me what you want already?”
But to Kiran’s surprise Scalian laughed, a raspy one. She turned to Gatril and said, “I guess you were right. He isn’t a sexplorer.”
“Wait, you were testing me?” Kiran scratched his head.
Scalian said, “Yes. I hate humans who try to establish their dominance over everyone else. If your friend hadn’t convinced me otherwise, I would’ve already eaten you.”
“Okay…” said Kiran. “Then, will you give me your queex?”
“I will,” said Scalian. “But I won’t have sex with you,” she showed Kiran her long tail. “I use this when I get lonely. I’ll pleasure myself and provide the queex to you.”
“Oh,” said Kiran. “That’s good news.”
“However,” Scalian began, “I will need something to stimulate me. You and your friend will have to mate in front of me to get me properly aroused.”
“Whoa,” said Kiran. “I don’t think I can do it in front of someone else.”
Then Gatril hugged Kiran’s arm and said, “Oh, stop being so shy. I thought you said sorcerers are willing to do anything to get what they want?”
Kiran remembered his words clearly, and decided this wasn’t worth walking back on his resolve. “Alright. I’ll do it.”
“Good,” said Scalian. “Follow me to my burrow.”
The lamia slithered off into the vegetation. The human and bosdrake followed behind, careful not to trip over her elongated body. Scalian eventually got on all fours and crawled into a hole in the ground big enough for a cow to fit through.
Kiran and Gatril crawled through the dark, cool tunnel, with Kiran’s small lantern as their guiding light. The path eventually ended in a vast circular space, which despite Scalian’s size, was big enough that she only occupied one third of it.
Upon entering into the serpent’s chambers, Gatril began to strip. “We better get started.”
Kiran took off his clothes under the watch of Scalian. She was able to contorts her body so that her lower half with her legs, vagina and anus rested before her. Kiran handed her a jar, instructing her to pour her fluids inside it when the time came.
Gatril took Kiran’s hands, bouncing on her feet and jiggling her breasts. “So you want me to go first or you?”
“Let’s do it together,” Kiran said, getting on his back.
Gatril stooped over his face, stroking his erect manhood. She turned to Scalian with a seductive grin. The other reptile began to tickle her vulva with her tail and fingered her anus.
Kiran grabbed Gatril’s bottom and buried his face between her butt-cheeks as his frisky tongue eagerly wiggled inside her, soaking up all the seeping moisture. Gatril took hard licks of the tip of his member, each causing the boy to twist his toes. Gatril swallowed his penis, bobbing her head slowly, forcing all of him into her throat.
Scalian stuck her tail into her sufficiently moist passage, poking against her cervix with thrusts that made her tense. “Hey…you two…switch now…”
Kiran lifted Gatril off his face, and Gatril spat his penis out of her mouth. She turned around and positioned her vagina over his lap. She sat, slowly guiding Kiran inside her, making both of them moan. Scalian made sounds of euphoria as well.
Gatril grinded rhythmically on top of Kiran, increasing her speed and the intensity. Both of them winced each time Kiran slid deeper into her. She moved fiercely now, both of them wearing intense expressions.
Scalian bit her lips as she thrusted her body parts inside her. Her ears filled with the moans of the two. Fluids seeped out of both ends; where her vagina produced queex, her anus produced smek, however she concentrated more on milking more of her queex for the young man. 
Kiran grip Gatril’s waist and thrust his hip like a piston. Her muscles clenched vice-like, but he kept going like a rocket, creating unbearable friction that had them wincing and bearing their teeth at each other, locked in a battle. Scalian’s body gyrated in coils as the pleasurably waves spread through her like an intoxicating high.
With such intensity among them, it was no surprise when they climaxed simultaneously in a chorus of screams and sighs. Scalian brought the jar to her leaking vagina as she trembled, filling it to the point where it overflowed onto the floor of the cavern.
Gatril sighed and leaned over Kiran’s face as both caught their breath, drenched in sweat. They kissed, gently. They chuckled, and kissed again. 
Gatril got off him, dripping his seed onto the ground. The bosdrake said to Scalian who was lying down, “Are you finished?”
Scalian lifted the jar of viscous matter.
Kiran got up and put on his clothes, eager to get to work. He took the jar from Scalian and said, “Thanks.”
“If you do need anymore, you can visit me again,” Scalian said. “But do bring back some food next time. Now hurry up and go. I usually get hungry after any mating activity, and I’m not very picky.”
Kiran and Gatril hurried outside and went back to his quacycle. Kiran took out the ingredients to add to the mixture; cobalt and volcanic rock he bought from a merchant in his village. He brought them through the same process as he did the last time, creating a small orb, however this one was a pale-yellow color. 
Kiran fitted it into another socket, whereby Gatril said, “What does this one do?”
“I’ll show you.” Kiran got some distance from Gatril and raised his staff. He activated the yellow stone and tapped the ground. There was an abrupt tremor and a huge wall of earth erupted from the earth.
“Is that a shield?” Gatril said.
“Kind of,” said Kiran. “I can use it for defense, or,” Kiran tapped his staff twice, creating two more walls of earth each smaller than the first, “I can use it as leverage.” Kiran climbed onto the rocks and reached the highest one.
“This Witching Tournament is beginning to sound more interesting,” said Gatril. “I wonder, do they allow beasts inside?”
“Only as pets,” said Kiran. He hopped down and approached Gatril, embracing her. “But you’re not a pet. You’re my friend.”
Gatril almost smiled. His words were tainted with the slightest of sincerity. But she had to realize that this was just one human. The others might not be the same. She said, “Don’t pay it much mind. It’s just a consideration. Now where are we off to next?”
“To find a selkie,” he said. “I need a water spell. And hopefully this time I get to taste between their legs.”

CHAPTER THREE

The following day, after resting in the safety of a tree, Kiran and Gatril ate some breakfast of dried meat and fruits and took a bath in the nearby watering hole. At that time Kiran also had to fire a few shots at a pride of lions to scare them off.
Next on their list was finding a selkie, an aquatic beast who fancied itself deep, silent rivers. There was no such place for miles, and the pair ended up going back on the main road. It was hear that Gatril had to cover herself from head to toe with a cloak, as they rode pass a few steam-powered and animal drawn carriages.
The nearest river was through the town of Wopol, a slightly larger settlement than Kiran’s village, also under the rule of Tatanui. Here the buildings were constructed of a type of green clay similar to cement, their tops fitted with sloping roves. They were painted mostly in beige, dark brown or yellow, and advertised various businesses. The town was also well aware of the happenstances with the beasts who lived nearby, and built ornaments and charms that supposedly gain their favor or warded off their unwanted attacks.
Kiran found a motel on a less crowded street, surrounded by tall trees that offered sufficient shade. He looked along the road to see if anyone was looking in his direction, and when he realized no one was, he looked over his shoulder and said, “It’s clear to go, Gatril.”
“I’ll see you later,” said Gatril, hopping off the quacycle. She hurried into the bushes and disappeared out of sight.
Kiran rode onto the compound of the inn and parked his vehicle away from some of the carriages, tying it to the fence. He entered into the mahogany colored interior and found the reception desk. There were small tables and chairs with refreshments around them, but unlike the other visitors, Kiran moved with urgency. 
Kiran booked a room using money he’d saved up during his many errands in the village, and walked to the back where he was led by a waitress in a black frock to his room. 
It wasn’t anything extravagant, it was a small town of course, but it did have a bathroom behind another door and a stacked bookshelf. After securing his goods inside the dresser, Kiran got his ID and firearm license together. He placed a bundle of flowers outside of the window so Gatril could find his room, and left the inn with his gun and staff.
At this leg of his journey, Kiran’s goal was to familiarize himself with the town’s streets and finding the location of the river. He spotted a few of the Tatanui police on patrol, men wearing red uniforms with white hems and seams, covered by sharp plates of metal in the form of a vest, gauntlets and shin pads. The emblem of their country was proudly embezzled on their chests, and in their hands they brandished stocky rifles with large cartridges. Kiran guessed they were the kind that usually held twelve rounds.
Kiran took care to avoid the officers on the street, and instead made his way to the local fish market, attracted by its strong smell. The vicinity was a set of stalls and square spaces covered by tarpaulins so the sun wouldn’t spoil their goods. Fishes of all colors, shapes, textures and sizes from those as small as Kiran’s index finger to ones as large as himself were on display. Some vendors added diversity to their goods with vegetables and other animal meat.
Kiran heard various conversations as he walked by. Some vendors called out to him for a sale, but Kiran either declined or didn’t respond. But soon Kiran’s ears picked up something in his realm of interest. A conversation where the word “selkie” was mentioned more than once.
It came from a fish merchant and a police officer. 
The merchant was an aged woman with a few grey streaks in her plaited hair, however her face still bore a suppleness, the last remnants of youth as the wrinkles under her eyes tried to steal them. Her breasts also stood up despite her not wearing a bra either. 
While she weighed some fish for a customer, she said, “I just told you, sir, I haven’t seen any of those selkies around here for months.”
The guard said, “I don’t believe that. Numerous persons reported seeing selkies in the river scaring them away from the fishes.”
After attending to the customer, the woman gestured to her stall. “Do you see how much fish I caught? I wouldn’t have gotten so much if the selkies were really scaring people. People confuse all kinds of animals and other monsters with selkies. This town is too big and noisy to house monsters. Like I said, I haven’t seen any.”
The guard frowned. “Very well then mam. Thank you for your time.” The guard walked away, but as he did, Kiran, who had been standing close by and pretending to read a map, took a few glances at the woman and found another peculiarity. 
She just so happened to have a huge bulge in her belly. Was she pregnant?
Kiran knew human females couldn’t breed beyond the age of fifty, and she also happened to have a wider variety of fish, and bigger ones at that.
Suspicions tickled Kiran’s nose, and he decided he would do some investigation of his own. 
Kiran waited until evening came, when everyone was starting to pack up after a good day’s sale. Kiran returned to the market and found the woman packing up her things on a cart and pedaled it out of the market. “Okay,” he whispered, hiding in a dark alley as the woman rode by, “time to go.”
Kiran moved by foot, opting for stealth rather than speed and ease of transportation. Not to mention he was quick on his feet too. As the sun set, and the gaslight lamps came on, Kiran skulked from alley to alley behind his target. 
He followed her to a secluded part of the city through a path of fern bushes and noisy crickets. Kiran took out his staff, now cautious of what was lurking around these parts. The woman led him to a cottage built atop a concrete base. It was situated in a damp area with large, smooth stones placed around the house with a walkway leading onto the path. Further from the house was a small stream, further fueling Kiran’s assumptions.
“Now let’s see what happens,” Kiran said, and crouched behind a tree.
The woman parked the cart inside a small shed and proceeded inside the house. Lights came on through the windows, and a lamp outside illuminated the yard. The woman came back out, dressed in a light blue skirt and her hair tied into a bun. She sat on the front porch in a rocking chair, drinking something while she caressed her stomach.
Kiran picked up a fishy smell in the air he hadn’t a few moments ago, but casted it off as just the leftovers coming from the woman’s house. She hummed to herself, adding to the noisy insects, frogs and gurgling stream.
Then Kiran heard splashes.
They came from out of view, east of the river were the growth concealed the rest of its body. The splashes got louder, and the silhouette of the form that made them appeared, thick-bodied with humanoid proportions.
Kiran tightened his grip on his staff. 
He saw the woman stop the rocking chair and stand up. More of the shadowy figures appeared, varying in height with a few short ones. He heard the woman say, “Good evening everyone. How are you?”
The visitors lumbered out of the water and towards the house, into the light that revealed them. They had slick, shiny skin a shade between blue and grey. Their hands and feet were webbed, with a dorsal fin that stemmed from the back of their heads and down their spines. They had large pale eyes and a green neck and belly. Their mouths were wide, their lips thick, and their muscular nostrils large and contracting. The sides of their jaws were lined with gills, and Kiran knew exactly what they were.
“Selkies,” he whispered. 
Kiran contain his excitement, accessing the situation. He glanced at their crotch, but saw only pink, fleshy stubs atop their testicles. There was no female in sight much to Kiran’s dismay. 
The woman approached them eagerly. Three of the selkies the size of children ran towards the woman and hugged her, while the three larger males watched in silence. 
I knew it, Kiran thought. She must’ve been with the selkies. And those ones, they must be her children.
Kiran had heard stories about humans and monsters mating to reproduce under certain circumstances, particular the beasts who possessed human intelligence. Here was something along those lines. But his mission came first, he needed selkie queex for his spell. He didn’t dare face them on his own, and decided he would go back for Gatril.
But as the boy turned around, he was met with two of the selkies staring him down. Kiran froze. “Yikes!”
“Trespasser…” growled one of them. 
Kiran tried to run but a selkie held onto him. Kiran spun around with his staff and activated his force-counter spell. The concussive blast knocked the selkie away, but the other one managed to deliver a backhand to Kiran that immediately stunned him and dropped him on the ground. 
The selkie dove after Kiran. Kiran lifted his staff one more, but the selkie slapped it away. Kiran shrieked and leapt towards it. The selkie grabbed him and threw him into a tree. The burst of pain cause Kiran’s muscles to seize up, and the selkie lifted him by his neck and carried him towards the house.
Kiran struggled, but his strength couldn’t match that of the fishman. This made him realize just how helpless humans were without their magic or weapons.
