"In other news a previously unknown skin-eating bacterial infection which eats the entire skin off within 48 hours is sweeping across Australia, and so far has killed over 45,000 people in just one week."
"Moving on from that, a war between India and Pakistan intensified as nuclear weapons were used on cities of both nations.  Preliminary reports indicate mass casualties..."  Jill stops mid- sentence and says "What does "mass casualties" mean when we are reporting millions of people killed by natural disasters?  Did these nuclear weapons kill only 10,000?  We just do not know.  Anyway, communications in the area have been disrupted by the electromagnetic interference of the nuclear blasts.  So I guess there could be many more dead 	who knows?"
Jill struggles to remain focused on just reading the reports.
Jill continues: "An earthquake caused a breach in the 300 foot tall Nurek Dam in Tajikistan, the second tallest dam in the world.  The resulting release of water is believed to have killed 10,000 people downstream."
"Intense lightning burned an entire city to the ground in central Uganda.  No one survived, and the death toll is estimated to be 25,000."
"A sinkhole opened under the city of Mount Gambier in southern Australia, swallowing the entire city. Over 30,000 people disappeared and were buried in just seconds."
Trying to lighten the mood Jill adds "In sports, the Little League World Series was held in Williamsport, Pennsylvania yesterday. The game had been postponed by a day due to baseball-sized hail." OK, so that did not lighten anyone's mood, she thinks to herself. "Don't you wish for the days when we could discuss a baseball game and not think about a disaster? Anyway, back to the disastrous events of the week" Jill says as her face turns to stone once again.
"In the Netherlands a breach in the Afsluitdijk Dike led to a secondary breach of the Houtribdijk Dike, flooding all cities along the Markermeer Sea, including Amsterdam where the canals were flooded and many were trapped in their homes and drowned."
"There were numerous earthquakes along the Ring of Fire Pacific fault line. Intense damage was caused all along the fault line as entire cities were swallowed whole or burned to the ground by falling molten rock, resulting in heavy casualties."
"In the Pacific Solomon Islands, thousands of local monkeys became enraged and attacked island residents, tearing them to pieces. Scores of people were killed..."
Jill pauses and says "That's all I can handle. Suffice to say a lot of bad stuff continues to happen day after day after day. There are far more than I can report. I could go on but there just does not seem to be any point in it." Jill pulls out her earpiece and leaves the anchor desk as the news crew tries to figure out what to do next. They put up live video from Amsterdam showing dead bodies floating in the flood waters.
Around the world the persecution of Christians intensifies.  Many of the group of 144,000 have been martyred during the past two years.  Their leader Shem Kolb continues to coordinate the efforts of evangelization.  But due to treaty obligations with the Western Alliance the authorities in Israel have declared the group to be "enemies of the State."  The believers meet in secret and by social media connection, but the authorities have planted computer viruses in the social media platforms.  There is a bounty placed on members of the group, and those who arrest any group members are rewarded with extra Marks in their account.  Midnight raids of believer's homes are a regular occurrence.  Tonight it is Shem who hears the breaking down of his door as the Citizen's Police storms into his home. He is taken away into the night as his wife and children scream in terror. Shem is not heard from again.
CHAPTER 14
WORLD-WIDE WAR EXPANDS

It has been over three years since the Vanishment and the installation of Antivon as the US President. President Antivon as head of the Western Alliance is determined to conquer even more nations, even though the list already includes 73 nations and territories of all sizes. He arrogantly adopts the credo and coat of arms of the legendary novel hero James Bond, who used the motto "Orbis Non Sufficit", meaning "The World Is Not Enough." The world must be his, and his alone, he reasoned. There is no room for other lesser beings. After all, he is a god. He calls his military chiefs into counsel to plan his next move.
As the military chiefs arrive for the meeting, two of them walk behind the others and ask each other whether it is honorable to support this world conquest goal. What is the point, when no other alliance can now match the Western Alliance military might? These two did not realize there was a new technology installed to listen to all discussions within the White House grounds. Several armed men appear and quickly take the two Generals out of the building.
They are replaced later that same day.
President Antivon takes charge of the meeting and demands that more countries must be brought into the Western Alliance before the other alliances of the north, south and east can move on those same countries. He has a plan which he lays out to the Generals who are assembled. It involves the Middle East and North Africa. Yes, there is a treaty with Israel, but that is no matter.  That treaty is a temporary distraction and will be invalidated at a convenient time. He sends out his Generals with instructions to devise a plan to attack the Middle East through Israel and then proceed into North Africa. The Generals, although surprised, depart to do as he has demanded. They know that if they do not do as he has asked, others will replace them and do the job. It is a difficult time for moral decision making.
The Generals return later that week with a military plan to invade the Middle East. Israel will be the intermediate target, and will become a base for further conquest into North Africa. The plan is accepted and President Antivon tells them to wait for his orders to proceed. President Antivon tells them he will talk with the Israeli Prime Minister to clear the way for a "low impact invasion" of Israel.
President Antivon calls Israeli Prime Minister Garlock: "Be prepared to set up my statue in the Temple on the Temple Mount. I am nearly ready for the next phase." Prime Minister Garlock replies "We are ready to go whenever you give the order."
In the meantime several of the General Staff meet secretly to discuss their options. None of them trust each other. There have been too many secret police arrests of high officials, including generals. But they each agree that something must be done to stop the madness before it goes any further. They agree to watch for an opportunity to take action to implement a change in government "when and if it becomes a feasible option." As they depart they each have no specific plan, and no real hope that they can be effective in stopping President Antivon from becoming a dictator in all respects.
During the preceding three years the people have been primed to accept the new religion of President Antivon, and now most are ready to embrace it with great enthusiasm. The prospect of a secular god with no moral requirements on them who will also heal the earth by his environmental measures and eliminate those hated moralistic Christians has wide appeal. A religion without moral requirements is enticing. Social media is used to spread this evangelism presenting President Antivon as a god. His status as someone who can cheat death, heal the earth, and give his followers the riches they desire takes on mystical levels. At the same time President Antivon has steadily become a more imposing and physically powerful figure with super-human powers of persuasion and mental abilities rarely seen. He can suddenly speak any language, perform great feats of strength, give amazing oratory, and mesmerizes all audiences which hear him. Prime Minister Garlock said of his newly found powers "He has become possessed of powers never before seen by mere mortals. He is indeed a god among us." Loyal followers agree.
The Western Alliance sets out to conquer even more helpless nations. Most fall easily, some resist and the results are brutal for those countries and their citizens. The least of the nations are not spared, and none are too small or insignificant to be brought under this umbrella of tyranny.
On the island country of Nauru, the smallest island country in the world, a group of men are fishing among the coral reefs which ring the island.  To their surprise a small watercraft carrying just twenty armed soldiers from the Western Alliance arrive.  Bewildered, they tell the soldiers to go somewhere else and stop disturbing the fish, at which point they are shot. The soldiers go onto the main island continuing to shoot every citizen.  Within a few hours all of the 2000 citizens of the island are dead or captured.  The country has no military significance except that it can be counted as one more nation ruled by the egomaniac Antivon. To him, ruling useless bits of terrain is a matter of feeding his intense power lust.  One by one, nation by nation, the Western Alliance expands its global coverage.
But the other three major world alliances are not prepared to simply allow this expansion to continue. Bloody battles are raging around the globe as Western Alliance forces seek to expand their footprint. At this point, the Northern Alliance, badly bruised by their failed Middle East invasion just three years earlier, has regained enough of its strength to resist the Western Alliance in key areas. A series of naval engagements in the Mediterranean Sea and Baltic Sea take a toll on the Western Alliance. Several of the West's large warships have been sunk, including a carrier. The Northern Alliance also thwarts the advances of the Western Alliance into southern Asia and the southern part of Russia, which enrages Antivon. He vows revenge.
The death toll from the continual world-wide war is staggering, and rising rapidly.  Over 100,000,000 have been killed on all sides.  It has been the bloodiest world war in history, and it is not over yet.  No side has any interest in stopping the war.  In some ways, the Alliance leaders see the wars as the only way to keep their economies going.  But the cost is enormous, both humanly and financially.
As a result of the wars plus the numerous and continual natural disasters there is a world- wide economic depression. Food shortages are the primary concern for most people. The life of the average person has become one of simply trying to survive. Most of their lives have been reduced to a subsistence level, and many face starvation. The world has gone from just the standard human issues several years ago to daily disasters, chaos, famine, unrest, social upheaval, unfettered crime, and a total breakdown of societal standards in a very short time. But as bad as things are now, the real suffering is about to begin, and will intensify by several orders of magnitude. It is time to enter the second half of the Tribulation.
CHAPTER 15
THE MIDPOINT

It is nearly three and a half years since the Vanishment. After work Jill Steiner is back at her apartment and calls her Mom:
"Mom, I have learned that the Midpoint of the Tribulation will be the full reveal of the Antichrist. Until this point he has pretended to be interested in solving the problems of the world, but instead he has engaged in continuous war just to gain power.  The Antichrist started by consolidating ten nations into his Revived Roman Empire, and then took over many more nations. Now that he is the most powerful leader on earth, Satan will use him to try to consolidate all the nations of the earth under a one-world system where Satan will be the real leader. Satan will exert maximum influence over this evil leader and use him to set up a satanic worldwide religious system, and the False Prophet will assist in the task of establishing the Antichrist as a false god. Then they will impose this satanic religious system on the entire world."
Mom: "You have it right, dear.  In my Bible study group we have been studying the dragon and the Antichrist.  This is the point when the Antichrist becomes "fully one" with the dragon Satan, as Revelation 13 says:"
Revelation 13:1 “The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.”
"Our study group has been reading the book "The Future Times" and it says about this Midpoint time period:
"Having been thrown out of Heaven, the dragon Satan is now confined to earth and is desperate since he is running out of time and knows it. Satan is seen standing “on the shore of the sea”. The “sea” refers to the gentile nations as opposed to “the land” which is Israel. The sea is in turmoil due to the Rapture having occurred. Satan chooses a man called here “a beast coming out of the sea” from among the gentile nations who will be his proxy and do his will.  Satan empowers his human counterpart to seize a massive amount of power, and his ultimate goal is to eliminate the Jews.  This man is often called just “the Antichrist”, but because of the way John presents him we will call this man the Antichrist, who is a gentile, from a Western nation since he will take over as King of the West.  Daniel’s prophesies about him is that he “came up among them”, meaning among the western nations (Daniel 7:8).  Satan will empower him personally through demon possession and Satan will also personally possess him at times, something extremely rare.  This man will be set up by Satan as an idol to be worshiped in the new religion of the Tribulation, a secular religion which worships a man instead of God or a presumed god.  While a religion is generally the worship of a deity, during the Tribulation this worldwide religion will be the worship of a man empowered by Satan, and therefore the worship of Satan himself.  This godless religion will be focused on the things which mankind in unbelief seek to do apart from God, and would likely include humanism, internationalism, environmentalism, and socialism, all attempting to solve the world’s problems apart from the true God of the universe.  This satanic religion will be a combination of false humanistic ideology and a degeneration into the depths of hatred and wanton barbarity.  Satan will empower and use this man along with a godless religion to seek to implement a fake millennium of his own, thinking he can somehow thwart God’s plan for a Millennial reign of Jesus Christ.  Satan has read the book of Revelation, but he wants to re-write the ending.  He chooses a man and gives him great power – the power he offered to Jesus Christ during the three temptations, but Jesus refused to accept it from him. (Matthew 4:1-11)  But during the Tribulation Satan will find his true soul mate, and this man will embrace the satanic plan and readily accept the power Satan offers.  The world will suffer immeasurably as a result."
Jill adds: "I have been reading what the Apostle Paul said:"
2  Thessalonians 2:3 “Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day [Second Advent] will not come until the rebellion [Tribulation] occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction [Antichrist]. 4 He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple [Abomination of Desolation], proclaiming himself to be God. 5 Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things? 6 And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. 7 For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back [Holy Spirit] will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. 8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming [Second Advent]. 9 The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie, 10 and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. 11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie.”
Jill continues: "I have also read that together the two Beasts set up their worldwide false religion based on worshiping the Antichrist, which in reality is worshiping Satan.  The False Prophet will also be demon possessed and will perform amazing acts of false miracles using satanic power.  Matthew 24:24 refers to the Antichrist and False Prophet working together: “For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.”
"The world is falling into the trap and accepting the lies of this false religion instead of accepting the grace of God through Jesus Christ the true Savior. This is why the judgments during the Tribulation will be so intensely destructive and deadly. God is gracious for a time, but He will not be mocked by this false religion for long."
Jill's Mom interjects:  "Jill, you have come so far.  I am proud of you.  The leader in Israel is just a puppet of the Antichrist, and has become the False Prophet for a new secular religion based on making the Antichrist a human god with statues of himself which are idols to be worshiped.  It is all so sickening.  Revelation 13:15 says: “The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. 16 It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads.”
Jill: "I need to get an expert on my show tomorrow to interview about this issue. Watch my show. Bye Mom."
Mom: "I always watch your show. Along with a billion other people, you know. Bye."
Jill wondered what her Mom meant by "a billion people." Jill thought she had a couple million viewers.
The next day Jill is at her LANX news studio and has invited Professor Heathrow, Professor of Biblical Ancient Civilization Studies at the University of Southern California, to explain what the Bible says is about to happen at the Midpoint of the Tribulation.
Jill: Professor Heathrow, we are very near the Midpoint of the Tribulation. What can we expect to happen next?"
Professor Heathrow:  "First, let us define the Midpoint.  The Bible tells us that the Tribulation consists of two equal parts, each exactly 1260 days long.  In the Bible, years do not match our current 365 day years, since the ancients measured years by the moon, not by the sun, so years in the Bible are 360 days long, not 365 days.  So 3 1/2 years is 360 x 3.5 which is 1260 days.  But days are days.  The so-called "Vanishment" occurred 1255 days ago.  That means we are 5 days from the exact Midpoint of the Tribulation.  And it is a big event in the unfolding of the eschatology of the Tribulation."
Jill: "Professor, I appreciate that you are so intellectual, but what does it mean to most of my viewers?"
Professor Heathrow: "Quite right, of course. Well, it means things are about to get much, much worse. At the Midpoint the False Prophet leader of Israel will put the statue of the Antichrist, called the Abomination of Desolation idol, in the temple in Jerusalem. Then it will appear to speak. This use of ventriloquist demons will fool many as demon voices will come from the idol statue itself. The deification of the Antichrist by the False Prophet will continue to build, and the entire world will become ensnared by this false religion. True believers who refuse to worship the idol statue of the Antichrist will be persecuted, and many will be killed for holding firm to their faith. Strong economic incentives will be used as the False Prophet forces people everywhere to take the Mark of the Beast, and no one will be allowed to buy or sell anything without The Mark. So the incentive to comply and accept this religion will be very powerful. Even some believers will take The Mark, and the temptation will be very strong since the survival of the person’s family appears to be at stake, but those believers who accept it will suffer and even die for doing so. Believers must understand that their martyrdom is required to evangelize a hardened world, and also that they will be greatly rewarded for their martyrdom. This false religion is used by Satan to attempt to kill off believers, and many will become martyrs, but it will be because of God’s Plan to use them to evangelize the world, not because Satan desires it. This is why believers who are in Israel at the time the idol statue is erected in the temple must flee to the mountains and remain there under divine protection until the Tribulation is over, since they will be the bulk of the Jewish believers who live to go into the Millennium."
Professor Heathrow continues:  "The idol is a sign to the believers in Israel to flee to the safety of the mountains east of the Jordan River.  Matthew 24 foretold of the idol statue of the Antichrist during the Tribulation and the requirement for all believers in Israel to flee and not come out of hiding until Jesus returns and the Tribulation is over:
Matthew 24:15 “So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’ spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand— 16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.”
"Then Jesus went on to discuss the Tribulation as the worst period of human history:
Matthew 24:21: “For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.”
"And then Jesus talked about the False Prophet:
Matthew 24:24: “For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have told you ahead of time.”
Professor Heathrow continues: "When the idol statue of the Antichrist is set up in the temple in Jerusalem all believers in Israel must flee immediately without any delay to the high desert area of current day Jordan. If they do not flee quickly, they will be killed. These Jewish believers will form the core group of those who will repopulate the earth during the 1000 year Millennial reign of Christ."
"In the meantime, the False Prophet has already devised a scheme for forcing all people everywhere to worship the Antichrist, and he is using economic incentives for this purpose."
Revelation 13:17 “so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name. 18 This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.  That number is 666.”
Jill: "Professor, the number 666 has become legendary as a satanic symbol. What does it mean?"
Professor Heathrow: "The Mark of the Antichrist is said to be 666, which is “the name of the beast” or “the number of its name”.  The reason for the 666 is not clear yet, but it will become clear very soon to those who have true wisdom.  This will be part of the economic arm- twisting by the Antichrist, and will be so powerful that only the truly faithful believers will be able to resist, and that at the peril of their own death, and also the death of their family members.  We see God's warning to believers in Revelation 14:9-10: “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand, they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury.”  There will be many believers who are martyred during the Tribulation for refusal to take the Mark of the Beast.  There will also be believers who die in disgrace because they take the Mark of the Beast in spite of having been warned not to do so. Therefore, taking the Mark may spare the believer from death from the Beast's henchmen, but it will not spare the believer from death during God's judgments which are meant to target unbelievers, but will also target those who take The Mark.  That is the significance of 666."
Jill: "Then what comes next, after the Abomination of Desolation idol?"
Professor Heathrow: "The last half of the Tribulation will be a time of a total breakdown of society. People who are not believers will engage in a detachment from reality like never seen before. Freedom will be lost in exchange for the power and false sense of security from the State. There will be a worldwide false religion accepted en masse by people refusing to believe in Jesus Christ as Savior. Worshiping the true God will be a crime punishable by death. Good will be called evil and evil will be called good by the degenerate masses. The innocent will be judged as guilty by the State while criminals are declared to be heroes. Crime will be rampant as people prey on each other. Political power will replace individual liberty as all dissent will be repressed. Police agencies will be used to enforce political dictates as only those who take the Mark of the Beast can engage in economic activity, or buy or sell at all. Failure to have the Mark will be a crime. The Bible will be declared a hate book, and all who believe that it is God’s Word will be pursued as the enemy of the State.  All that is Truth will be called false, and the lie from Satan will be deemed to be the truth. The world will be turned upside down. That is because Satan at his core is a liar who promotes only lies, and hates the Truth. And his main man on earth, the Antichrist, will be the same as his benefactor Satan, a liar from beginning to end, as the Apostle John said:
John 8:44 “You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.”
Professor Heathrow continues: "But even in the face of all this evil, God does not give up offering salvation to the degenerate people of the earth. He will go to extreme lengths trying to get these people to change their minds and accept Christ as Savior."
Jill:  "Thank you for that valuable insight, Professor."  Jill turns toward the other camera: "And now for the rundown on the daily disasters which occurred during the past 24 hours..."
Later that evening, Jill Steiner is at home reading the book "The Future Times." She thinks to herself, "Well this writer has been right so far, I wonder what is coming during the next last half of the Tribulation, which is about to begin. Here we go. Revelation Chapter 7."
"God provides every chance for salvation for those who are willing to listen.	then the most severe divine judgments begin during the last 3 ½ years of the Tribulation."
Revelation 7:1 “After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree.”
Jill thinks to herself: "I wonder what my Weatherman at the station will do when he sees this happen? No wind anywhere on the earth? Doesn't that also mean no rain?"
Jill continues to read: "As we saw previously, the first six Seals reveal disasters which include intense weather conditions on the earth. Scorching sun, wind, hail, tornadoes, hurricanes, lack of rain, too much rain, and so on will cause tremendous hardships. Both personal and economic disaster will be the norm during the Tribulation. God uses His elect angels to control the weather patterns of the earth, and these angels will be especially active during the Tribulation. There are four weather angels stationed in the north, south, east, and west portions of the globe, and during the Tribulation they will be given authority to cause great destruction on the earth."
Jill thinks to herself: It has been nearly 3 1/2 years since the Vanishment occurred.  The Professor said we are only 5 days from the Midpoint.  So the Bible says it is about to get far worse.  Fantastic.  Those who went up in the Rapture were the fortunate ones.  She considers what she should have done differently with her life.  Everyone just wanted to have a nice social life and make some money and get ahead.  She realizes now that was all so shallow.  If only  she had become a believer early in life.  But enough what-ifs, I am here for a purpose now.
She continues to read about the part Satan and his demons are playing in all of this:
"At the same time Jewish believers are fleeing Israel into the high desert country, Satan and all fallen angels are thrown out of Heaven. Upon seeing those Jewish believers fleeing, Satan and his demons attack them, trying to stop them from getting to their place of divine protection in the mountains east of Israel. This attack is described here as “the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent.” But the Jewish believers will be protected as the passage says “The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness.”
The time available for leaving will be short, and their escape will require supernatural divine protection referred to as the “wings of an eagle” to protect them on their trip out of Israel, as this phrase is regularly used for divine protection: Exodus 19:4 “You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself.” Deuteronomy 32: 9-11 - “like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them aloft.”
"Satan will try to prevent the Jewish believers from escaping Israel by “spewing water like a river” which refers to the demons thrown out of Heaven along with Satan pursuing the fleeing Jews like a torrent, and possibly also flooding the Jordan River valley which the Jews will be crossing, but that attack will fail as God counters it and protects the fleeing Jews.  But any who delay their departure will be killed. Once the Jews cross into the country of Jordan, in a region generally east and southeast of the Dead Sea, they will be protected by God with supernatural hiding, angelic protection, and provisions during the remaining 3 ½ years of the Tribulation. Once again Satan will be frustrated in his attempts to gain some advantage. Now that these Jewish believers have escaped and are under a supernatural dome of divine protection, Satan's attempts to kill all Jews will have failed, so this part of his evil plan will have been foiled."
Revelation 12:13 “When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. 14 The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach. 15 Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. 16 But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.”
Back in Jerusalem, Josh Simmons, the new leader of the 144,000 evangelists, has maintained the library accumulated by Shem Kolb, the previous leader who disappeared over a year ago. Josh thinks to himself how he wished Shem was still in charge.  He was such a great leader, and always knew what to do.  Josh is not so sure of himself.  But he is talking with those who remain of his fellow 144,000 evangelists, and he reminds them of what is coming now that the Midpoint of the Tribulation is near.  They will need to be prepared to act, and act quickly.  He reminds the others who are gathered together what is about to happen, and what they must do in response to it.
Josh starts out: "Several events will soon happen simultaneously at the exact Midpoint of the Tribulation.  The first event is the installation of an idol statue of the Antichrist, called the Abomination of Desolation, in the Jewish temple here in Jerusalem.  This triggers the second simultaneous event, since the idol statue is a sign for all Jewish believers in Israel to flee to the mountains where God has provided a place of divine refuge and protection.  This creates a crisis on earth for Jewish believers, and timing is crucial.  We must obey instantly or we will  be killed by the forces of the Antichrist.  We must follow instructions precisely, as Matthew 24 says:
Matthew 24:15 “So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’ spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand— 16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17  Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house. 18 Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak. 19 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! 20  Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.”
Josh: "Watch and wait. The time is near. Be prepared to depart the instant you hear the news." Those who are gathered depart for their homes to prepare.
A few days later, on orders from President Antivon his statue is put inside the Temple in Jerusalem. When anyone approaches it, the statue appears to speak, and people are amazed by it. Rumors spread of this "miracle" and many come from far away to the Temple to worship the idol of President Antivon. The Prime Minister of Israel as the Prophet for the Antichrist spreads the word of the religion which focuses on worshiping both the idol and President Antivon. President Antivon and Prime Minister Garlock solidify the image of President Antivon as a god. The pilgrimage to the Temple to worship the statue of the Antichrist becomes an annual ritual for many faithful followers.
In Times Square New York a huge crowd has gathered at the news of the statue of President Antivon being put in the Temple in Jerusalem, and that it is speaking. A young man says to his friend "This man is a god! He cheated death, he has amassed enormous power, he is healing the earth from climate change, he has taken on those moralistic Christians and put them in their place, and now even his statue speaks. I was never religious or mystical, but this man has powers I have never seen. I say he is a god." Cheers go up among those listening.
His friend agrees "Right on all accounts, and I would add that the Harmonics of the Universe seem to be in alignment with him. There is something spiritual about how he senses the feelings of the Earth, and how he is connected with the entire cosmos miasma. He is certainly a spirit from another dimension. I believe!"
The Times Square crowd chants over and over: "Antivon is our god, Antivon is our god	"
Back at LANX News, Jill is in the studio reporting the daily disasters as news of the idol in the Temple reaches her.  She stops mid-sentence and says: "The Abomination of Desolation idol has just been put into the Temple in Jerusalem.  This is exactly what the Bible said would happen.  Today is 1261 days since the Vanishment, the day which was prophesied for this to happen.  All Jewish believers in Israel must immediately flee to the mountains east of the Jordan River."
In Israel, news of the idol statue being put into the Temple had already spread quickly. The signal for Jews to flee has been given. There are some Jewish believers who had not yet heard, but were watching Jill's internet news. They immediately get up, grab their packed bag, and run for their cars. The roads are clogged going east as believers flee to the mountains, headed for a place near Petra, Jordan and another location in far southern Jordan. As the believer Jews flee to the mountains, they are pursued by the Western Alliance forces, and also by an unusual occurrence in the skies.
As the Jewish believers are fleeing Israel and heading to the mountains of Jordan, a sudden fury overtakes them in the form of a thick swarm of unknown origin. One woman named Nena had to leave her car behind and is hurrying to keep up. She thinks she cannot make it across the Jordan River bridge. The swarm seems to be overtaking them. Nena says to one of her fellow travelers "I cannot make it, I am going to die here on this road." Just as she says those words a sudden sandstorm comes up from the East, and blows the swarm backward.
Others shout encouragement to Nena, the last in the line of escapees. "Come on Nena, you can make it!" shouts one man. It is her cousin from North Jerusalem. He drops back to help her. "Save yourself" she says, I will not survive." But her cousin will not let her fall behind. "I will carry you myself if that is required, but hurry, we must get across the Jordan." Just then the swarm returns with a vengeance to strike the fleeing believers who have fallen behind.
They are almost there...the river is just yards away. Suddenly the east wind blows the swarm back, allowing Nena and her fellow stragglers to reach the Jordan River, and cross to the other side.  The swarm turns and heads back toward the west to take their revenge on an unprepared Jerusalem which is now empty of believers, except for a few who did not heed the warnings.
As the last of the fleeing believers reach the Jordan mountains sanctuary, they are greeted by those who have been in place and set up the camps. "You are safe now" says the camp leader at Petra. "Nothing can harm you here." Nena and the others settle in and get their living quarters assignments. As they do, they think of the horror in store for those who did not flee Jerusalem.
The believers go into hiding as directed by the Bible.  They find provisions have been stored for them there by Christians who departed years ago, and by the 144,000 who brought the remnants of supplies left behind after the failed Russian invasion three years earlier.  The remaining few of the 144,000 who survived the purges of the first half of the Tribulation look down across the Jordan River valley and say a prayer for those who will become new believers and will need to stay in Israel and fight the forces of the Antichrist.  The 144,000 did their job evangelizing during the past several years, and now it is time for a new and very different form of evangelization.  Two witnesses will soon appear in Jerusalem and shock the world.
CHAPTER 16
THE TWO WITNESSES

Back in Jerusalem two figures appear on the Temple Mount who had not previously been seen in the city. No one remembered ever seeing or hearing them on the Temple Mount, but now they are loudly proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ the Messiah from outside the Temple.
Their names are Moses and Elijah, and they have been on the earth before, but departed 3000 and 2500 years ago respectively.  And they have come back with a message.  Prepare the way for the Lord, because He will return in 3 1/2 years.
Upon hearing of the two new witnesses in Jerusalem, Josh Simmons the leader of the 144,000 calls together those who had just fled Israel and pulls out the book "The Future Times" from which he reads aloud to those who are now gathered in the mountains near Petra, Jordan, not far from the border with Israel.
"Just as John the Baptist was the herald of the First Advent of Jesus Christ, these two witnesses will be the heralds of the Second Advent of Christ. All three have the same message – prepare the way for the Lord. This time the message is to prepare the way for the Second Advent of Jesus Christ which will be the culminating event of the Tribulation."
Revelation 11:3 “And I will appoint my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth. 4  They are “the two olive trees” and the two lampstands, and “they stand before the Lord of the earth. 5 If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die. 6 They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.””
Josh continues reading:
"The two witnesses will preach for 3 ½ years (3 ½ years = 42 months = 1260 days), so they will arrive at the exact Midpoint of the Tribulation.  God never gives up on grace, and evangelism will continue despite the evil in the world.  The Jewish believers of the first half of the Tribulation will have recently fled to the mountains for divine protection and to wait for the Second Advent, as instructed by Matthew 24.  This is because they must be reserved as a remnant of believers who will populate the Millennial Kingdom, so their sole job is to survive the remainder of the Tribulation.
The two witnesses arrive in Israel where no evangelists remain, and they will preach the gospel from the temple and convert many Jews to Christ. These converts during the second half of the Tribulation are instructed to remain to fight the enemy armies and will successfully defend the remnant of believers in Jerusalem from the attacks of the Antichrist forces near the end of the Tribulation. These two heralds make it clear that this is not about them, but rather it is all about Jesus Christ returning to earth as promised. And so their message is believe in Jesus Christ as Savior or perish. But who are they?
They have been here on earth before, and are Moses and Elijah – yes the exact same two who were on earth a couple thousand years ago.  They were last seen at the Transfiguration of Christ when Jesus talked with them as witnessed by Peter, James, and John (Matthew 17:1-9).  And so they will return to earth during the Tribulation to evangelize and provide spiritual guidance to the believers of that time and serve as heralds to proclaim the coming of the Lord (Malachi 3:1) 	The world leaders will hate them and their message about Jesus Christ, and will want them dead. But the two have special divine powers to repel attacks and even kill attackers. They can cause drought, plagues, and disasters at will to demonstrate the validity of their message. It will only rain when and if they allow it. If attacked, they will kill with a word from their mouth."
Back in Jerusalem the two new witnesses Moses and Elijah attract a large crowd on the Temple Mount. But they do not enter the new Temple. Instead, they remain outside and preach to the crowds. Moses begins:
"Prepare the way for the Lord, Who will return in exactly 1260 days.  He is Jesus Christ, Who was crucified in this city.  He was and is your Messiah.  Accept Him as your Savior.  The time is short.  The choice is yours, but act quickly.  He is coming to judge the world and remove all unbelievers, then He will reign on the earth for 1000 years in His Kingdom.  God has sent us to be your final warning. He will not delay His vengeance even one day beyond the time which has been set."
Moses continues to speak, denouncing what is occurring inside the Temple walls: "In this Temple there are daily animal sacrifices.  Such sacrifices were used in the past to point to the Messiah, but He has come, so the purpose for those sacrifices is gone.  The only true sacrifice acceptable to God was Jesus Christ, spoken of through the Old Testament rituals, but not through the current animal sacrifices.  These so-called spiritual leaders are false teachers who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as Messiah.  In 1260 days the Antichrist and his minions will be destroyed, and those who do not accept the only true Messiah Jesus Christ will be  destroyed along with him.  The Jews inside this Temple do not tell the message of Jesus Christ, but continue to refuse to believe in their Messiah.  They kill animals while the only true Sacrifice for sin has already offered Himself.  Do not join with them in their unbelief.  They will be set aside by the Lord Himself at His return.  Accept your Messiah Jesus Christ and you will be saved."
Elijah extends the message: "Fellow Jews, Moses and I were here long ago.  We have lived out our lives and have also seen Heaven.  Now God has sent us back to you as a warning to accept the Messiah Jesus Christ as the only Savior.  The Antichrist is now on the earth, and Israel harbors a False Prophet.  They deceive and lie.  The Antichrist pretends to be a god.  But the only true God will send them into the Lake of Fire in just 3 1/2 years.  The message of the Antichrist and other followers of Satan is one of evil, hatred, and violence, which is the way of Satan.  God has sent us as messengers of His love and salvation, which He has made possible through His Son Jesus Christ the Messiah, Who is now at His right hand.  But the time is short.  Fellow Jews, prepare the way for the Lord's return.  He is indeed the Messiah, the only Savior; the one your fathers missed, but remains available to your generation.  During the past 3 1/2 years you have seen Tribulation, as the first six Seals were broken open to reveal judgments on the earth.  As difficult as they were, these were just a pinprick compared to what is coming.  As of now, this is the beginning of the Great Tribulation, the Seventh Seal.  There will now be seven Trumpet Judgments and seven Bowl Judgments.  You will face disasters never before seen on this earth.  They will be awesome in their power, and terrible in their destruction.  And then the Lord will return.  Your eternal salvation, and your survival on the earth during the next 3 1/2 years, are both at stake.  Only those who are secure by faith in the Lord can stand against them."
People listening begin to talk among themselves asking if these two can really be the Moses and Elijah of old. They are amazed at the power of their speech, and the message rings true to many of them. One young man says he knows where the believers met before they fled to the mountains, and said they had left behind a Bible and some books for those who would remain in Israel. Several set off together to go find the books. As they do, a large earthquake is felt.
News reports later that day report a 9.8 earthquake occurred in Asia over 2500 miles away.
In Petra, Jordan, Josh says to his fellow Jews who are in hiding: "Our task now is to survive until the Lord returns, just as our previous leader Shem had said many times.  We are the core remnant of believers who will go into the Millennium and live another 1000 years with our Lord as our Ruler.  Do not be deluded by calls to return to Israel.  Do not be fooled that you can go back and help your fellow Jews during the coming trials.  The Bible is clear that we must remain and wait patiently for the return of the Lord.  It will be hard to stay here when we know our fellow Jewish believers are suffering.  But the Word of the Lord is clear.  We will stay, we will survive, and we will be delivered.  But the Word of the Lord says this is just the beginning of the Great Tribulation.  What has been seen so far is nothing compared to what is yet to come.  And come it will.  Let me outline what is about to occur during the next 3 1/2 years:
Seal 7 will be opened next, and it begins a series of judgments which will include 7 Trumpet and 7 Bowl Judgments. They will occur in the following sequence:
Trumpet 1 – 1/3 of all vegetation destroyed, and 100% of all grasses destroyed 
Trumpet 2 – 1/3 of sea life destroyed, plus 1/3 of all ships
Trumpet 3 – 1/3 of fresh water polluted/destroyed
Trumpet 4 – sunlight diminished by 1/3, moon and star light diminished by 1/3 
Trumpet 5/Woe #1 – demon attack #1 on humans -- stinging demons
Trumpet 6/Woe #2 – demon attack #2 on humans -- killer demons
Near end of Tribulation (probably last year of Tribulation), the Bowl Judgments will occur: 
Bowl 1 – painful sores cover the bodies of unbelievers
Bowl 2 – sea water completely destroyed – all remaining sea life dies 
Bowl 3 – drinking water destroyed
Bowl 4 – sun scorches people and the earth 
Bowl 5 – darkness becomes pervasive on earth
Bowl 6 – Euphrates River dries up allowing Kings of the East to invade Middle East Bowl 7 – Devastating earthquakes and hail; Babylon destroyed by nuclear weapon 
At very end of the Great Tribulation:
Trumpet 7 / Woe #3 – Second Advent, Jesus Christ destroys unbeliever armies in several locations including at Armageddon Josh concludes by saying: "After the Lord returns in 3 1/2 years from now, we will continue on the earth during the Millennium and live another 1000 years under the rule of the Lord in a perfect environment.  This same earth will be healed by the Lord Himself, even though it will have seen so much destruction and disaster.  We are the Jewish remnant set aside to go into the Millennium.  But for now, our task is to remain here in this place of divine protection and wait patiently for the return of the Lord.”
CHAPTER 17
FURY UNLEASHED ON THE EARTH

Back outside the Temple in Jerusalem, Moses and Elijah declare to the assembled crowd: "Look into the eastern sky at the thick plume of black smoke rising high into the atmosphere from the Abyss. Hell itself is being unleashed onto this evil world as Satan's criminal demon forces are being released from their prison. These demons from the underworld have been waiting for this moment for thousands of years, and now it has arrived. They lust for revenge and are bent on mayhem and murder. Only the saved will be able to stand against these swarms of demons."
An audible gasp goes up from the crowd as they see the plume of thick black smoke. It is estimated to be eight miles high, and can be seen for over a thousand miles in all directions. It is swirling as it rises, somewhat like a giant tornado of smoke. And then black swarms go out in all directions from it, looking like bees escaping a burning hive.
In Petra, Jordan, the believers in hiding also see the plume of smoke and ask Josh Simmons to explain it. Josh reads again from the book "The Future Times:"
Revelation 9:1 “The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss.”
The “star” is Satan (Isaiah 14:12; Ezekiel 28:16) who is now banished to earth during the last part of the Tribulation.  Satan became ruler of the earth when man sinned, passing rulership from Adam to Satan.  But Satan does not enjoy staying on earth, so his demons do most of his work there.  Many do not realize that Satan currently has full access to Heaven...Once he is thrown out of Heaven and banned to earth he knows the end is very near for him.  He has read the Bible.  All he has left in his bag of tricks are chaos and destruction. 	Before Satan is kicked out of Heaven he will be given the keys to unlock the Abyss, a middle-earth jail where millions of criminal demons have been imprisoned for thousands of years since before man was created. These criminal demons violated the rules of the angelic conflict long ago in some unknown manner, so were imprisoned in the Abyss by God (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6).
In another of the encampments where Jewish believers are hiding farther south in Jordan, the camp leader reads from Revelation 12 to those assembled there:
Revelation 12:10 “Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: “Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah.  For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.  11 They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.  12 Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them!  But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you!  He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.”
The camp leader continues with his explanation:
"God's elect angels rejoice to see Satan and his demons finally thrown out of Heaven, and look forward to the end of the Tribulation when Jesus Christ will imprison all of these miscreants and set up His 1000 year Millennial reign on earth under perfect environment.  Perfect environment is only possible in the absence of Satan and his fallen angels.  We see how believers during the Tribulation will not shrink from death, and many will be martyred as a result of Satan's fury on the earth and their refusal to renounce their faith in Jesus Christ or take the mark of the beast.  God allows this martyrdom as a testimony, but He will also judge harshly those who kill His believers.  Satan knows his time is very short.  He has had many thousands of years of freedom since his revolt against God, but that will soon end.  He will be in a rage after being cast out of Heaven, and the entire earth will suffer for the next 3 ½ years as a result.  In fact, it will be the worst period on earth in all human history.  Matthew 24:21 says: “For then there will be great distress [Tribulation], unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again."
The camp leaders huddle among themselves and discuss what comes next.  "Now we see how these simultaneous events come together at the Midpoint of the Tribulation.  After Satan fails to kill the Jewish believers fleeing Israel at the Midpoint of the Tribulation he becomes even more angry and frustrated.  As it says in Revelation 12:1 “Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.”  As a result, he will take out his anger on those who become believers during the Tribulation.  This is why there will be such a holocaust of Jewish believers during the second half of the Tribulation.  These are the martyrs seen around the throne of Heaven in Revelation 7:14 “And he said, “These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”
Back in the Petra encampment, Josh Simmons continues to address believers there: "The final three Trumpet Judgments or “Woes” will involve these demon criminals who are about to be released onto the earth where they will create chaos and torture and eventually kill unbelieving mankind. Even Satan will not be able to control them, as he was not able to control them in the ancient past when they violated the rules even Satan had abided by. It should be noted that demons have personalities and areas of extreme action just like humans. These demons being released during the Tribulation are pure criminals, and they will enjoy the torture they inflict on humans...With this as background we will now see what happens when the imprisoned criminal demons are released after thousands of years in the Abyss. It will not be pretty, as Revelation 9 declares:"
Revelation 9:2 “When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss. 3 And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth. 4 They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 5 They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes.”
Josh continues to explain to the believers in hiding what is happening. "Satan has unlocked the Abyss and his demon criminal armies who have been imprisoned for thousands of years in chains of smoke and darkness have been released. This is the fifth Trumpet Judgment, and it releases multitudes of torturing demons which the Book of Revelation describes as looking like locusts and having stingers like a scorpion. They are criminals from long ago so they know how to torture people, and they will do it very well and with great enthusiasm. They have the ability to strike quickly and unexpectedly from the sky just as locusts can maneuver from place to place. People will not know when to expect them, so will live in constant fear.
Unbelievers are tortured and also believers who depart from their faith and take the Mark of the Beast, but God protects His faithful believers."
Back in Israel, inside a children's orphanage in Tel Aviv most of the children fled with their leaders to the mountains.  But one had hidden away and did not want to leave.  One child named Ben peers out from his hiding place and sees that he is all alone.  He carefully emerges and surveys the house for any signs of his orphan family.  He is hungry so he goes to the cabinet but all the food has been taken.  He ventures out into the street and sees "the Swarm." He did not know what it was, but he knew it was not right.  A soldier spots Ben and yells for him to hide.  "Stay back -- they are evil" shouted the soldier.  Ben replies "But I have no one to help me, or feed me.  I am only 12 years old.  Please help me."  The soldier motions to him to run across the street, which is empty of people.  As he reaches the soldier he asks "where did my orphanage family go?"  The soldier replies "To the mountains.  I was supposed to flee but was stuck behind trying to help an elderly couple.  But they were lost.  So why didn't you flee?" Ben replies "Because I was afraid."  The soldier replied "So you and I are a team now.  We will stay and fight them.  You must be strong.  You are now a warrior.  You will need to summon  all your strength to survive.  Are you with me?"  Ben replies "Yes, I am."  The two go off to the soldier's home where Ben gets a meal and contemplates what lies ahead.  He wished he had not hidden from the orphan family.  But he was just too afraid.
Ben hears a knock on the door of the soldier's house. He peeks through the curtain as the soldier answers the door. The person at the door announces "We are the Citizen's Police. We understand you have sided with the Believers, is that true?" The Citizen's Police used the term "Believers" to refer to Jews who had converted to being Christians. The soldier replies "I am just a soldier, nothing more. What I believe is just what I believe. You can leave now." The soldier sizes them up as untrained civilians who are now just thugs from the secret police. He looks to each side of them, then back behind himself, surveying the situation. There are three of them, and one has his hand in his coat, maybe a handgun. The leader says "Come with us, you are under arrest." If it had not been for Ben hiding behind him, the soldier might have complied.  But now it was more complicated.  Ben was his responsibility.  The soldier appeared to be ready to comply, then suddenly grabbed a knife and stuck it in the neck of the leader, then quickly opened a drawer, took out a handgun, and shot the other two thugs. Ben came out screaming. The soldier said "Ben, we are soldiers. You and me. We are a team.
These are bad people. They were going to take you away, but I will protect you. Do you understand?" Ben answers "I think so," to which the soldier replies "Good boy, now let's drag them inside and then we will figure out where to go." As they do, "the Swarm" appears in the distance. It is getting closer.
After they have hidden the bodies the soldier reads to Ben:
"This is from Revelation 12:13:  When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child...17  Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus."
The soldier said to Ben "The dragon Satan has turned his hatred toward us who remain in Israel. We are those who keep God’s commands and hold fast to the testimony about Jesus. We are required to stay and fight. Ben, you are young but you are required to fight.  Those who fled have their mission, which is to survive. Those of us who remain are the Resistance. Evil has been unleashed on the earth. We must resist it to the very end. We are required to be fierce warriors. Do you understand?"
Ben answered "Now I understand. It is clear to me that I was chosen to do this. I will fight them. I am strong because the Lord is with me." The soldier was amazed at the resilience of this young boy. "Good. I will always be at your side, I promise." There was no time to grow up slowly, this was a time of making quick choices and doing things required of adults. The two of them walked off into the streets of Tel Aviv together to fight the forces of evil.
At the Tel Aviv Citizen's Police Headquarters the Online Court session is about to commence. The soldier turns on the coverage of the court trials.  Every Tuesday at 2PM it happens.  Those who have been accused by the Citizen's Police, a vigilante justice system imposed on Israel by the Western Alliance as part of the Treaty, holds an online Court.  Logins are obtained by anyone who wants to participate.  But those who have tried to vote against convictions in the past have often ended up in the next online court conviction process.  So the online voters are those who always vote to convict the accused brought in by the Citizen's Police.  As the online session begins, each one who has been accused is brought out in front of the camera and the crime is stated.  The first is an old man who was seen in the downtown park reading a book.
The book was called "The Future Times." It is a banned book, and the punishment for reading banned books is hard labor. The charges are announced in a banner across the top of the page, over the face of the accused. Before the banner crosses completely, the votes are already complete. All votes are "guilty as charged." The man is hauled away as the next is brought in. It is a young woman from a town outside Tel Aviv. She is accused of "failure to yield" to a Citizen's Police officer. This could have various meanings, but the charge is well known to those who have been accused in the past. The woman is crying as the charge banner proceeds across her tear-filled face. The votes are in. Guilty as charged. She is hauled off as an old woman is brought in next, accused of trying to buy food without having the Mark. The process continues with predictable results until all accused have been judged guilty.
The soldier who had been watching the trial online has watched many of these and has been sickened by them. This time he has had enough. He is only a block away from the Citizen's Police courthouse. He heads out, and Ben follows. Ben has been training to fire a handgun. He was a natural. He would have been an athlete in other times. The pair make their way down the street and into the alley behind the courthouse just as the young woman they had seen on the Court website is brought out to be put into a waiting van. The soldier tells Ben "Do what you need to do." Ben nods, as the soldier walks toward the van. As he gets closer two armed Citizen's Police thugs raise their weapons. The soldier says "Whoa, I was just wanting to see if you guys need any help here." The answer is a terse "No, go away." The soldier pretends to turn away, then swings around shooting. One thug falls, and the other is wounded. The handgun of the soldier is jammed. The Citizen's Police officer tries to regain his foothold, then raises his gun and aims at the soldier, and "Bang." It was Ben, who shoots the Citizen's Police thug dead. The soldier grabs the hand of the young woman and says. "Hurry, follow us." She complies as she looks aside at the young boy who just saved them.
Ben runs along behind, and even fires a shot as another Citizen's Police officer peers outside the door behind them. They make their way down the street and into an alley, then escape across town.
At the edge of town the young woman asks "Who are you two?' The soldier replied, I am General Gurian. I am the leader of the Jewish military resistance here in Tel Aviv. My counterpart in Jerusalem is General Dayan. My group is going to Jerusalem to join with his. You need to come along if you want to survive. And the boy, he is a soldier. His name is Sergeant Ben-Ben. He saved your life and mine."
Ben sticks out his chest in pride as he is announced as Sergeant Ben-Ben. He thinks he likes the name Sergeant Ben-Ben. He thinks it is funny that the soldier calls him the "son of a son."
The General tells the young woman and Ben to move quickly, there is much to do, and no time to waste. They must get to Jerusalem by sundown.
As they make their way to safety, Ben asks the General, what is "the Swarm"? General Gurian pauses trying to think how to explain the concept to such a young boy. "Ben, the swarm is the army of Satan himself. They are demons who have been unleashed on the earth to do the will of their master Satan, who is bent of wreaking havoc and destroying whatever gets in his way. The swarm is a roving band of murderous demons, who have just been released from prison in the Abyss under the earth, and soon will be allowed to harm and even kill those who do not belong to the Lord. You might ask why Satan would kill his own people. Simply stated, it is because Satan is pure evil. There is a more precise explanation which we can discuss later.
But those who belong to the Lord will be delivered from the Swarm, while those who do not obey the Lord will be delivered to them. They are heinous murderers, like their master Satan. We do not fear them. They cannot touch us. But as for the rest of the population of the earth, many billions will be killed by the Swarm. Yes, I said billions."
Ben shrinks back at the description of the Swarm as Satan's death squad. He ponders these things in his heart as the three make their way toward Jerusalem, where they must join with General Dayan's forces. Ben thinks about how he was playing soccer in the streets with other young boys just a couple weeks ago, and now he is a soldier in the Resistance against Satan himself. It is hard for such a young boy to get his head around such things. But he is trying. He remembers stories he had been told about the young boy David, who as a shepherd in the fields killed a lion and a bear who had tried to steal his sheep. "I am like David.  I am strong. I will slay lions and bears. I will protect the sheep." He falls asleep in the van on the way to Jerusalem, and wakes up in a whole other world.
When they arrive in Jerusalem, General Dayan greets them. The two Generals head off to the Resistance HQ while the young woman and Ben-Ben sit at a cafe.
Ben: "So who are you?" The young woman replies, "I am Abby Levison, from Nazareth. I came to Tel Aviv two years ago with my grandparents after my parents died in an accident. I was working in a jewelry store when it was looted during the riots a year ago. Since then I have been working odd jobs, just like so many others. But you, Ben, you are just a young boy. And you killed my accuser. You are a hero at such a young age." Ben is not accustomed to dealing with women. But he does his best to seem grown up. "I was in an orphanage since before I can remember. When the Vanishment happened I lost some of my friends. Then when the people fled Israel for the mountains, I lost everyone in my orphanage. I hid and stayed behind. It was not very smart. But here I am. Now I am a warrior. I will fight the lions."
Abby does not understand the lions reference, so she instead asks him about the General. "What is the story of the General? What is he doing? Why did he chose me to rescue."
Ben tries to think. He does not know why the General chose to rescue Abby. But he decides to tell her something anyway. "The General saw you on the online court and knew you would be useful to the Resistance." Abby looks surprised, but knows she is dealing with a young boy. "So he chose me to do what, exactly?" Ben replies "To fight, that is what we must do." Abby decides to change the subject and ask the General later. Ben thinks to himself "That went pretty well. I think I deal with girls quite well."
At Resistance HQ the two Generals are talking.  They have already discussed what the Book of Revelation says, which they both believe in, and will use as their guidebook.  General Dayan concludes the meeting "We are required to fight for the freedom of the Jews who become believers in the Lord during this next 3 1/2 years.  It is prophesied that we will win.  So that is a fact, but how we will win, that is up to us to figure out.  I propose that we split the defense of Jerusalem and Southern Judea into my forces in Jerusalem and your forces in southern Judea.  There will be much fighting in both areas.  My forces must hold on, while your forces must force the enemy to stop their advance on Jerusalem.  It is the only way."  The two Generals agree and they depart.  General Gurian takes Abby and Ben to their new safe-house south of Jerusalem near Bethlehem.
The next day General Dayan gathers his Jerusalem military resistance forces, which are the remnant of the Jewish military which was mostly disbanded under the treaty with the Western Alliance. With the Jewish believers having fled to the mountains at the middle of the Tribulation, General Jacob Dayan, a new believer who has immersed himself into learning about what the Bible says will occur during the last half of the Tribulation, now emerges as the new de facto military leader in Jerusalem. With the Jewish political leadership having been reduced to supporting the False Prophet, a tool of the Antichrist, the protection of Jerusalem is in his hands. He knows the task will be very difficult.
General Dayan has been reading the book "The Future Times" and tells his assembled troops what they should expect:
"We in the Jewish military who have now recognized our previous error and have accepted the Messiah Jesus Christ have a solemn mission. We must defend Jerusalem from the enemy, namely the Western Alliance under the Antichrist. Our political leaders have sold out our people. Our military was virtually disbanded, and now only we few remain. The task ahead of us is daunting. In the short term we cannot do everything we would like to accomplish. The Western Alliance will invade Jerusalem according to Bible prophesy. The city will fall to them -- that much we know. But we will do what we can, wherever we can. All believers who were here in Israel during the first part of this period of Tribulation have fled to the mountains.
They cannot help us any longer. They were required to flee and survive. But we who remain and are new believers are required to fight. And fight we will. The forces of the Antichrist are advancing against us as we speak. They are coming to destroy Jerusalem. We are but a few, and they are many. But the Lord is with us. We will be protected. And whatever happens in the short term, we will be victorious in the end. Are you ready?"
The troops unanimously approved and commit their lives to the cause.
CHAPTER 18
THE TRUMPET JUDGMENTS -- TRUMPET #1

Back at LANX News, Jill Steiner realizes what has just happened, and what is coming next. She has learned her lessons well. Somehow knowing what is coming was not comforting to her. It is now just weeks after the Midpoint of the Tribulation. Jill knows the Trumpet Judgments will soon begin in earnest. She has written down a personal outline of the Judgments so that she can follow them as they unfold.
Jill's reviews her notes on what happens after the Midpoint:
Idol statue of Antichrist put into Temple in Jerusalem (Jill checks it as "done")
Two evangelists: Moses and Elijah return to earth, preach the gospel in Jerusalem near the Temple (also "done")
Seven Trumpet Judgments begin:
Hail mixed with fire and blood
Giant flaming mountain thrown down into the ocean All grasses, wheat and corn die
Fresh water polluted and poisoned Sun and moon darkened
Swarms of Demons begin torturing people (giant "Locust-scorpions") 
Second wave of "Horseman Demons" released, also kill many
Skin disease epidemic Blood in the seas and rivers All sea life dies
Remaining drinking water poisoned Sun scorches people on earth
Babylon destroyed
The return of the Lord -- Armageddon
Jill keeps these notes with her to remind of what is coming next. But she does not know how she will deal with announcing each of them on her daily news show as they unfold. The judgments mean death to billions of people. She also knows that her show was now being sent to news rooms internationally, so her impact could be enormous. Jill had become well- known for her accurate and timely reporting on all the disasters. Jill thinks it odd that Jill Steiner's Morning News show would be the show which reported these events to the world.
She thought of it as moths coming to the flame, because most would not believe her ties between these events and the Bible, but the people somehow could not avoid looking.
Nevertheless, by this time Jill had become the premier reporter for breaking disaster news in the entire world.
As Jill prepares for her daily news anchor duties, she notes the weather forecast. It is ominous.
LANX Chief Weatherman Ross Hoffman looks at the data and shakes his head. He has only a few seconds remaining before he goes on air. Ross cannot explain what he sees. But he believes he must deliver the weather news as he sees it.
Jill: "And now for the weather...Ross?"
Weatherman Ross Hoffman: "Let's get straight to the data. Wind patterns are like nothing we have ever seen. Upper level winds have ceased. Nothing is moving, and that pattern is set to continue. Meaning the normal upper level flows are not moving, because there are no Highs or Lows anywhere on the earth.  A stillness has settled in, and it appears to be a pattern.  It is a severe drought scenario. How long this will last, I do not know. But it will not take long for massive crop damage to occur under these conditions. There is no scientific explanation here. Upper level winds never just cease all over the world. But they have now. And it is a big problem. See how the weather map has no Highs or Lows. Nothing."
As Weatherman Ross Hoffman continues to discuss the unusual weather patterns, Jill Steiner realizes what it means.  The Trumpet Judgments have begun.   The first will be scorching heat and a destruction of grasses and crops.  The world is already in a state of mass starvation, and now it will intensify.  She envisions an earth without a blade of grass, and without wheat for bread.  It is time for Jill to resume coverage of the news.  She wonders how she will handle what is coming.  The impact will be unimaginable suffering, world-wide starvation and death on a massive scale.  The last three years were bad, but now things are about to get truly awful on the earth.  Jill thinks to herself that it is good to know what the Bible reveals, but difficult to know that terrible judgments are closing in very fast.  There will be 14 major Judgments over 3 1/2 years.  And those along with world war and also what evil dictators will do to the population of the earth.  Jill tries not to think about how she missed the Rapture.  She must focus on her role here and now.  She proceeds to cover the daily news, awful as it is on a daily basis, while knowing that the real horror is just around the corner.
Within weeks the earth is a tinder box of dried vegetation with no rain having fallen, and none is in sight. Jill reviews her notes on what she has learned about the timeline of the Tribulation. She knows what is coming next. It is Revelation 8:7 “The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down on the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.”
The next day her Weatherman airs the news of a devastating worldwide weather event.  Hail and fire, mixed with a red substance resembling blood.  Tests would later show it actually was blood.  It occurred suddenly, as people watched in horror, fire from the skies fell on the earth. The parched vegetation was burned worldwide as wildfires were fanned by strong winds created by the fires themselves, not by weather.  Within 24 hours the assessment was that 1/3 of all vegetation worldwide was gone, burned by the fire from the skies.  Stock Markets again plummet worldwide.  There is no doubt that a deep and irreversible global depression is at hand, and that many millions will starve.  Possibly billions.  The shock of this event leads to mass suicides.  The world knows there is not enough food to feed even 1/4 of the people now alive on earth.  Billions of people must leave the planet one way or another.
Several weeks later Jill is preparing her news report on the results of the devastation caused by the changes in weather including the fiery red hail event.  Trumpet 1 has occurred, and 1/3 of all vegetation has been destroyed, and 100% of all grasses are gone.  An entire season of crops wiped out. Worldwide mass starvation is inevitable. She thinks to herself what she had read from her book about his event:
"Trumpet Judgment #1 is wind shear velocity (“hurled”) fiery hail mixed with blood rain.  Remember, this is literal, not an allegory.  The angels are given authority to destroy 100% of all grasses and a third of all non-grass vegetation on the earth.  God takes away the majority of the world's food supply by killing off all grasses, including wheat, rice, and other grains which are the world's chief sources of food.  And since the world's livestock depends on what has been destroyed in the judgment, the meat supply will also be largely taken away as a source of food.  The resulting worldwide famine will be severe.  The oxygen and carbon dioxide cycle mediated by trees and other vegetation will be disrupted resulting in reduced oxygen supply.  There will be little timber left for building.  The earth will become scarred and ugly, and little beauty will remain.  This is truly a “scorched earth” as described in Joel:
Joel 1:10 “The fields are ruined, the ground is dried up; the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the olive oil fails. 11 Despair, you farmers, wail, you vine growers; grieve for the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field is destroyed.”
Jill files her grim report realizing most will not truly understand the full impact until they themselves are actually starving. And that would come soon.
Within weeks, relief workers in Africa are desperate. The situation is dire. The food shipments from donating countries have ceased. There is no food coming in, and very little was available on the entire African continent before the fiery red hail. In the best of times Africa has continually been near starvation. Now the starvation is reaching everyone there. Even the relief workers are without food. Reports of game reserves being poached for food spread, which only causes more people to realize how desperate the times are. Roads become filled with food refugees fleeing Africa heading for Europe. Boats full of people fill the Mediterranean Sea. They are pushed back by a fleet of European ships. They cannot accept these refugees when their own citizens are starving.
An emergency meeting of the African States Council convenes to discuss the crisis. But they are powerless to do anything. The food shortage is catastrophic. The next growing season is a year away. A food supply chain expert presents his data, and it is worse than thought.
Essentially, there is no longer any food supply chain into Africa.  He predicts that 1/3 of all Africans will die within the next 12 months.  The mass migration will fail as Europe and Asia have already sealed their borders.  The attendees depart dejected and in shock.
The scene is repeated in countries around the world.  Just 2 months after the fiery red hail occurred, food shortages are already at critical levels world-wide.  And there is no food coming in.  Death sinks in among the poorest of nations.  The rest are desperately hungry.
The following day Jill comes back on the air to report the news.  She covers the most recent several earthquakes and resulting tsunamis which occurred overnight, more large hail, numerous tornadoes, attacks by normally placid animals on their owners, the sudden appearance of a new skin-eating bacteria, and the arrest of Christians in numerous locations around the world.  Jill is weary of it all.  But she knows she must continue.  At this point her reading of the news has become a sort of ministry to the lost souls who live in constant fear and desperation.  She thinks that if she can just instill some hope in her audience of something beyond all of this, she just might make a difference.  What sort of difference, she does not yet know.  But one thing she does know -- things are about to get even worse.  She does not sleep much knowing that fact.  But she now knows she will come out the other end of this in the hands of the Lord.  She thinks mainly about the Millennium which will follow the current seven year period of Tribulation.  Maybe she will live another 1000 years.  Would she marry?  Would she have children...she does some quick math in her head...maybe a hundred children, one every ten years?  That thought freaks her out.  And what about being married to the same person for 1000 years?  How would that work?  Maybe I will not think so much.  She goes to sleep thinking about the Millennium, but wakes up thinking about the harsh reality of a new set of judgments.  And they have only just begun.
Then the thought of a 1000 year marriage recurs in her head.  She says to herself "I must be content with the terrible things at hand -- enough already, Jill!"  Then she laughs.  Just a little.
CHAPTER 19
TURMOIL IN ISRAEL

With the statue of President Antivon having been set up inside the Jerusalem Temple nearly a year ago, and reports of the idol talking, displaying amazing powers, and even healing a few who touched it, a steady stream of people are visiting the Temple simply to be close to the statue, and possibly even experience and benefit from its mystical powers.  Local Jewish leaders have lost control over access to the Temple, as people from all over are coming to see the idol which can perform wondrous signs.  Outside the Temple Moses and Elijah deliver their message of salvation to those who pass by, but very few listen.  Moses declares the statue to be an idol of the Antichrist, and a means of satanic worship.  "Demons are using this idol to perform fake miracles to promote Satan's own man as a god.  The one you are really worshiping is Satan himself."  Moses then quotes from 2 Thessalonians 2:3:
“Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day [Second Advent] will not come until the rebellion [Tribulation] occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction [Antichrist]. 4 He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple [Abomination of Desolation], proclaiming himself to be God."
Elijah picks up the message: "This evil faker will have a short time to play out his deception on the world, and then his end will come, as the Bible declares:"
2 Thessalonians 2:8 "And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming [Second Advent]. 9 The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie, 10 and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. 11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie.”
Moses concludes: "Turn away from the lie and toward the light of the Truth. Time is very short, and then eternity is forever." Those walking by on their way to pay homage to the statue of Antivon just scoff and hurl insults at the two witnesses.
A crowd gathers every day to hear Moses and Elijah speak. Many of them do not believe what the two are saying, but somehow they cannot stay away. These two speak with such authority and wisdom, and it is difficult to ignore them, even for those who do not believe them. Most do not even believe they are the true Moses and Elijah of old. But somehow they know these two cannot be ignored. So every day the two witnesses speak near the Temple, and every day a large crowd gathers to hear them. At the same time a steady stream of visitors come to the Temple to see the statue of Antivon and experience its power. Although it is a secular religion based on Antivon, his followers express a deep faith in his mystical powers to heal the earth.
Meanwhile, also near the Temple in Jerusalem, several Rabbis are arguing among themselves about the two witnesses. Rabbi Shulman from Jericho argues that these two are indeed the Moses and Elijah of old. He says to the others "The events of the past three years have opened my eyes to the reality that we Jews missed our Messiah. We were blind to the prophecies  from our writings, but finally I can see them clearly.  This Temple is spiritually bankrupt and is selling out to a worldwide satanic religion headed by the evil Antichrist dictator. The Jews in Israel who were believers before the Midpoint departed for the mountains, as the Scriptures required.  Now only a remnant of Jewish believers remain in Israel, mainly those of us who did not see the Truth until after they had departed. This Temple is a place of false religion, first apostate Judaism, and now the False Prophet has set up the statue of the Antichrist right here. Look at it! It is a lie! It represents the worldwide satanic religion. The New Testament reveals that many Jews will become believers in Jesus Christ as the spiritual blindness of Israel will be lifted as a result of both the Rapture and the ensuing events which unfold.  It also says that at the exact midpoint of the Tribulation a statue of the Antichrist will be placed in the Temple in Jerusalem as part of this worldwide false religious system headed by the Antichrist, who will be worshiped as a god. Then the two witnesses will evangelize and teach despite the temple's use to promote both apostate Judaism and the satanic false religion of the Tribulation. Open your eyes and see the truth! We are now in that time period which Jesus Christ referred to as a “Great Tribulation.”  He will return soon, but not before things get much worse."
Others Rabbis argue with him and accuse him of being a traitor to Judaism. Several tear their clothing as they renounce him. But others stay to discuss the issues with him, as they have also been wondering if they were on the wrong track.
Many Jews are slowly realizing that a new holocaust against the Jews has been occurring, and it is growing every day.  Jewish businesses in Western Europe are being fire-bombed, reminiscent of the mid-20th Century era.  In Russia, Jews are being rounded up and thrown into prison for no reason except for being Jews.  Throughout the Western Alliance Jews have become the new underclass of citizens, scorned and treated as traitors to President Antivon, regardless of being believers in Christ or not.  In every corner of the world Jews are reviled, threatened, incarcerated, tortured, and killed.  All simply for being Jews.  This would ultimately become the worst holocaust in human history.
CHAPTER 20
Trumpet #2

It has been four months since the widespread destruction of vegetation by the first Trumpet Judgment. The world is in a state of starvation and global depression. Misery has increased exponentially and the world is in chaos. Life is at subsistence levels.
Jill Steiner goes on with the daily news. She knows there are many more disasters and much more suffering to come. Things will get far worse, if that can even be imagined.
Before she begins her daily news show, Producer Jack Ford tells her "Jill, your news is now the number one news show in the world for reporting on the disasters. Can you believe that?" Jill replies "I knew a lot of people were watching, but number one in the entire world? I had no idea." Jill thinks it odd that she has become the one person the world turns to for disaster coverage, and her coverage was being sent to news rooms internationally. And people who saw breaking disaster news from around the world would send their video to LANX news just to have Jill air it first.
Just as her daily broadcast begins, a report comes into the news room sent from a commercial airplane pilot over the Pacific. The pilot reported seeing a blazing mountain of fire crash into the Pacific Ocean, and the resulting splash was about 300 miles wide. The report said the ocean immediately turned a sickly red as a concentric tsunami unlike any ever seen went out in all directions. The pilot added that the tsunami wave was "enormous" and "it will be a killer." Video from another airplane arrives within minutes showing a red fireball the size of a mountain coming out of the sky and landing in the Pacific Ocean an estimated 750 miles west of Hawaii. Jill sees it when the rest of her audience sees it. It is a sight which the world has never seen.
Producer Jack Ford hurries to find any live video feed, which he knew would be coming in shortly. As several videos arrive at the news room, he decides to put up a live video feed from Hawaii. Jack sends it straight to the on-air news feed as Jill is in mid-sentence reading reports coming in from other airline pilots.
Local Hawaiian HWTV News reporter Oko Nogomi was reporting on severe beach erosion on the western shore of Oahu when the fireball came into view of his camera.  At that point Oko shifted to live reporting about the fireball he had seen approximately 750 miles west of Oahu. Oko first replays the video of the mountain of fire, then relays to the world what he is seeing  as it is happening: "The fireball suddenly appeared in the western sky, and was not seen until it was relatively close to the earth.  You would think it could have been seen coming from space, but that was not the case.  I would have seen that.  When it appeared it was the shape of an inverted mountain, like a huge cone of bright red fire about the height of Mauna Loa, our largest Hawaiian mountain.  Due to the curvature of the earth I could not see the splash but it had to be gigantic.  But we did feel the earth move as it hit, and it caused smoke to rise out of several local volcanoes, including some dormant ones here on Oahu.  The resulting noise broke the sound barrier even this far away, and that sound took probably an hour to reach us. The energy is unbelievable.  I just looked up the speed of sound vs the speed of a tsunami, and sound travels 750 MPH while a tsunami can reach up to 500 MPH.  That means...let me calculate....that the tsunami should reach us in about 15 minutes."  After several minutes of reporting, Oko's cameraman points his camera to the west as he motions to Oko to look out to sea.  Oko turns to see what the world is seeing through the camera, a tsunami over 300 feet tall.  Oko returns to reporting: "As you can see, the tsunami is almost here.  It will surely swamp the entire island chain.  So this is the end of our little paradise.  If my wife and kids are watching, I love you.  This is Oko Nogomi, HWTV news, reporting...."  Oko turns to face the tsunami just as it reaches shore.  The video feed goes dark as the giant wave crashes over Oahu.
Jill continues to stare at the blank video feed for several seconds. Producer Jack Ford puts up another video which had just come in from a ship out on the Pacific closer to Japan. The Captain of a supertanker is seen yelling into his video that a 300 foot wave is headed straight for his ship. Within a few seconds the huge wave is seen coming over his vessel as the video feed is lost.
Jack Ford then airs the last video report from the Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii as the tsunami races across Maui, wiping out that monitoring location. Jill says to her producer "Enough video, Jack -- let's just read the reports." Jill covers the facts as best she can. But the videos told the story. Within 30 minutes reports come in saying the Hawaiian Islands had been swamped by a giant red tsunami. It is a certainty that all on the islands are lost. Aerial footage soon arrives confirming that there are no remaining buildings on any of the Hawaiian Islands. An aircraft carrier and numerous other Navy ships from Pearl Harbor are seen resting on their side or upside down where Honolulu used to be.
Within the next several hours reports of over 2500 large ships being lost at sea in the Pacific are received.  Many more were destroyed while docked in ports.  Hundreds of Pacific islands have been destroyed, including most of Micronesia and Polynesia.  Japan, Taiwan, New Guinea, the Philippines, and northeastern Australia were hit hard along their coastal cities, even though the tsunami height had decreased somewhat by the time it reached those locations.  The casualties are estimated to be over 75 million people.
Several days later Jill is reporting the follow-up from the burning red mountain: "News of the oceans and seas turning red is not nearly the worst issue here. The more significant issue is that nearly all sea life in the Pacific has been killed. That means one-third of all sea life world-wide has died. One third of all fish, whales, shrimp, lobster, krill and so on have died. The rotting of these creatures is already causing a stench which is creeping across the land masses. Island nations such as Japan, Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan and others are hit hardest by the loss of sea creatures. And the loss of so much sea life means less food from the sea. An already starving world is about to have even less food.
Jill reaches for her Bible study notes which she keeps on her desk in the studio. She begins to read to her audience:
"This event was predicted well over 2000 years ago in Revelation Chapter 8:
Revelation 8:8 “The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, 9 a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.”
Jill then tells her viewers: "I have been reading a book called "The Future Times" which was written a long time ago. Oddly, I played the author's online video the day the Rapture, or Vanishment as it has been called, happened. I would suggest it is good reading about what has been happening, and what is yet to come. Let me read some from that book:
"The second Trumpet Judgment is against the oceans and seas (salt water) of the earth. God takes away a large portion of another major food source, which is seafood. A third of all sea life is destroyed. The oceans are polluted with the rotting sea creatures mixed with blood thrown down, once again reminding that this is judgment for killing God's believers. But even the image of a mountain of fire and blood coming down from heaven into the ocean will not change the minds of the hardened unbelieving world.
This second Trumpet Judgment targets the oceans and salt water seas which together cover about 70% of the earth's surface and account for about 96% of the earth's water. There must be no attempt to try to explain these judgments as an accident such as a random meteor or asteroid.  An angel will literally throw a huge burning mass the size of a large mountain into the earth's oceans.  Remember this is divinely caused, literal and real -- not allegory, not symbolic, but real.  Psalm 105:29 says: “He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die.”  A third of the oceans and seas are turned to blood, and all creatures in those affected regions die.  Overall a third of all sea creatures die.  A third of all shipping is destroyed.  This destruction of so much sea life and many ocean-going vessels, on top of the destruction of a third of all vegetation on earth including 100% of grain plants, quickly squeezes the food supply to the brink, and starvation accelerates.  The rotting flesh of sea creatures and blood will create a worldwide stench and will further accelerate diseases.  The earth does not have time to react to one disaster before the next one hits.  The cumulative build-up of disaster upon disaster maximizes the intensity of the suffering.
It is worth comparing what is happening on earth at this time during the Tribulation to what happened when Moses warned the Pharaoh of Egypt to set the people of Israel free from slavery.  Moses warned and warned, then a terrible judgment would occur, but Pharaoh refused to change his mind.  Then the process repeated.  There were 10 plagues against Egypt, and Pharaoh showed a degree of hardness of heart which will now be equaled by unbelievers during the Tribulation.  Also note the correlation of the actual Trumpet Judgments to the judgments against the Pharaoh of Egypt.  The Egyptian judgments included blood, hail and fire, darkness, killing livestock, rotting flesh of wildlife, pain, unusual things falling from the atmosphere, and so on. The judgments are also similar since they caused intense suffering on a grand scale for the Egyptians, but not for the Jews, and in the same way God will take care of His own during the Tribulation. Even though the entire world will suffer hardship, the unbelievers are specifically targeted and the believers are generally delivered even though the times will be extremely difficult for all."
By this time her producer Jack Ford has his head in his hands. Jill just read on-air from a banned book. He knows he will be visited by the "Citizen's Police" soon.
The next morning, right on cue, three Citizen's Police thugs appear at the news room to arrest him and Jill. They are taken into custody and put into the maximum security prison. As she enters her cell she sees that her producer Jack Ford is already there in a nearby cell. Jill sits and wonders what the future holds for her and Jack. Maybe she should be more careful. But maybe this is my mission since I have a voice heard around the world. If I do not use my opportunity, might more people be lost for all eternity? The questions swirl in Jill's head as a small bowl of left-over broccoli stalk soup is brought to her cell as her only meal for the day. "Great" she thinks to herself. "Maybe they intend to starve me in here.”
CHAPTER 21
Trumpet #3

Three months after the red mountain of fire fell into the Pacific Ocean, another huge fireball, this time a white one, falls from the sky. Video from London shows that as it entered the atmosphere it split apart into thousands of pieces which then headed in all directions.
By this time Jill was back at her anchor desk, having been released from prison after her original three accusers had died from a sudden illness which swept through the Citizen's Police Headquarters, and most of the surviving prison guards had fled to forage for food and water. With no one left there to condemn her, she was released. Also, her popularity as a well-known news anchor probably helped. Her Producer Jack Ford had also been released.
So Jack and Jill simply walked out. The metaphor was apparent to the pair. They said to each other, "did you fetch that water? We might need it." After a laugh they thought how rare humor and laughter had become. Just another victim of this period of Tribulation.
Jill begins her return to anchor duties just as news about the white fireball is breaking. Producer Jack Ford looks at Jill and nods in agreement. During his imprisonment he decided that what Jill had been telling her audience was real. The Bible was right after all.  This is truly the Great Tribulation. The Messiah had already come and would soon return. He now believed it. Jill starts out:
"Glad to be back. Let's get straight to the disastrous news you all want to hear about."
Her news show audience now has even more viewers than before her imprisonment. Reports that the Citizen's Police had put her in prison only enhanced her reputation for reporting the facts as she saw them. That seemed odd to Jill since most of her audience did not accept her premise for why this is all happening. But as she has said previously, she looks at the phenomenon as "moths to the flame." They simply cannot help but look at the truth, even if they cannot accept it. So she simply trudges on.
Jill proceeds to cover the news of the white fireball. She described how it had split apart into thousands of pieces, all still quite large. Then the pieces went straight for many of the fresh water streams and rivers across the world, as if they had homing beacons. The result was the poisoning of one-third of the world's remaining fresh water supply.
Producer Jack Ford replays the video in slow motion showing the blazing white fireball as it split apart and sent pieces in all directions. The fact that the pieces landed so perfectly in streams and rivers was amazing to the viewers, so the video was shown over and over again. Video from specific regions showed the pieces landed in the rivers and streams, causing them to foam and roil as they rolled along. Those dependent on these waters died within seconds of drinking from them. This destruction of a large portion of the remaining drinking water supply would be devastating. An already starving and thirsty world was about to experience a new level of misery.
After she described the event, and the details it involved, she begins to read from her book:
Revelation 8:10 “The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water— 11 the name of the star is Wormwood.  A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.”
"The third Trumpet Judgment is against the fresh drinking water of the earth in lakes, rivers and reservoirs.  An angel throws a massive burning ball of bitter tasting poison into the fresh waters of the earth, breaking up and landing in numerous regions, then spreading out from there.  It will be made of a bitter poison compared to the taste of wormwood, although wormwood is not itself a poison.  The poison is unknown to earth and there is no antidote.  The poison will spread out causing 1/3 of all fresh water to be poisoned, resulting in many deaths from both poison and lack of drinking water.  The ball of fire is not an actual star, but looked like one to John.  Again, these are literal, but since they are not naturally occurring events they must be compared to what John knows.  These are divinely caused, literal and real -- not allegory, not symbolic, but  real.  Those who try to drink the tainted water die.  At this point there is very little food and now little drinking water available on the earth.  People are reduced to bare survival levels and extreme misery.  With very little fresh water to drink, the earth's unbelievers are not just starving, they are dehydrating to death. Believers suffer, but God does not neglect His own, so most will survive unless they take the mark of the Beast."
In the ensuing weeks and months the world was reduced to a struggle for food and water. The basest instincts of mankind were unleashed as people would kill for a cup of water, or a half slice of bread.  The world was starving and thirsting to death.  The death toll over the next several months was staggering. Estimates were sketchy, but thought to be well over 500 million. The world was reduced to basic survival. There was no thought of the future. No looking forward to retirement. No wedding plans. No hope for a family. No hope of any type, except for those who trusted God with their lives. Somehow they had food enough to survive. They suffered, but they lived on."
Even though Jill's news is reported all over the globe, she thinks to herself that no one gets the real message. She wonders if there is a better way to relay what is behind the disasters. She thinks of herself as a failure since people are listening, but not accepting the reality of what is going on. She heads home to her apartment after her news show and sits in her chair thinking about how people ignore truth and accept "the lie" so easily.

Trumpet #4

After another couple months of daily reporting of the grim statistics of the daily disasters, and the impact of the previous two judgments, Jill starts another day wondering when the next Trumpet judgment will come. It will be Trumpet #4 which will cause light from the sun, moon and stars to be diminished by one-third. She did not need to wait long. Today was the day.
As Jill was reporting the daily news, Producer Jack Ford told her there was an eerie and sudden darkness outside. Jill could not see it since her studio has no windows, but she stopped in mid-sentence and asked Weatherman Ross Hoffman to come on air and explain what was happening. The camera showed a stunned Ross as he simply said "I don't know what caused it -- give me a couple minutes."
Jill returned to her duties until after a few minutes Weatherman Ross Hoffman appeared again, looking bewildered.  Jill turned to him and simply said "Ross?"  Ross replied "Let's just look at the video from when this happened."  The video from 15 minutes earlier showed the sun shining normally over the LA basin, having risen to about a 45 degree angel by this time of the morning.  Then the video showed the sun dimmed by about 33% -- it just stopped shining at full intensity.  No clouds, no partial eclipse, no other interference discernible, it just dimmed significantly.  It was immediately darker as during a heavily overcast day with dark clouds.  As Ross was reporting the event, Jill chimed in "we just received reports from Asia that the moon and stars also dimmed, and by approximately 33%.  The darkness was discernible and caused people anxiety about the future of the universe.  If the natural lights of the universe dimmed today, what might happen tomorrow?  This was a huge confidence deflater, as if people had much confidence remaining in anything at this point.  But if the universe was waning, and possibly the sun would be lost, there was no hope at all.  Visibly shaken, weatherman Ross Hoffman stumbled for an explanation but had to admit he had no idea what was happening.  But he did say this had never happened in all of human history. Never, ever."
Jill: "Ross, what will this do to the weather?"
Ross: "The coldest climates will become uninhabitable as those areas will soon be far, far colder. For instance, northern Canada, Russia, and most of Greenland will never get above freezing, even in the summer. Winters will be brutal. Food production will decrease dramatically all over the world due to less sunlight, especially farther from the equator. I doubt anyone could grow wheat or corn anywhere north of Texas starting next year."
Jill: "But that eliminates almost all the wheat and corn producing regions in the US."
Ross: "Exactly. It will be devastating, especially on top of the recent destruction of crops this past year."
Jill was already prepared with her Bible study notes. As Ross finished, Jill began to read:
"This was predicted over 2000 years ago.  I will read from Revelation Chapter 8:"
Revelation 8:12 “The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.”
Then as become her custom, she reads from her book:
"The fourth Trumpet Judgment is a supernatural judgment against light on the earth, and the image of it leaves John struggling to explain what it looks like. A third of the sun becomes dark so that it shines less time on the earth. This is something which must be seen to understand, but it will be literal. A third of the moon (beyond just moon phases) becomes dark, and a third of the stars stop shining. People on the earth at this point are just trying to survive, and now will have shortened opportunity to do so due to the increased darkness. This Trumpet Judgment targets both light and warmth for the earth. Sunlight is significantly diminished by reducing the daylight hours by one-third, resulting in freezing many to death and eliminating many types of the few remaining crops which survived the first Trumpet Judgment. With the other judgments having taken away so many basic necessities there will be an increased reliance on natural light. But the reduction in moonlight by one-third and fewer stars makes nighttime activity more difficult, so the time available to accomplish basic survival actions is further restricted. This means there will be even more hardship when trying to deal with all the accumulating disasters. Again, divinely caused, literal and real -- not allegory, not symbolic, but real. This is not some gradual climate change or man-caused issue; it is divinely caused, sudden, and catastrophic in its effects."
As Jill ends her reading, she looks into the camera and says "Friends, what will it take to convince you that the Bible predicted all that has happened in the past several years? And if it has been correct about these things, then isn't the Bible the real source of Truth for the world?" This time producer Jack Ford smiles as Jill boldly tells her audience what she believes. Both of them have now lost their fear of the Citizen's Police, which is in disarray at this point, and most members had died in gruesome ways.
Jill ends her daily news show and departs for her apartment.  She begins to read about Noah and how he built the Ark to save the human race and also animal life.  She notes the parallels to the current period.  The world was hardened against the Truth in Noah's day, and the current population of the world mirrors that hardness of soul.  She thinks how Noah evangelized the world for 120 years while building the Ark, and his only converts were his own family members.  Seven people, in addition to himself, were believers.  The rest of the world rejected the Truth, and died in the Great Flood.  She wonders if her witness to the current world was having any more impact than Noah.  But then she thinks of Jack Ford, and is encouraged by his recent change of view.  Then there is a knock at her door.
Jill instinctively thinks the worst. It must be the Citizen's Police. Who else could it be? The knock repeats. Jill asks through the door: "Who is it?" The answer surprises her. "It's Adam, your brother." Jill had not seen or heard from Adam in three years. The last words between them were not very nice.
Adam: "Jill, I am here to say I am sorry...if you will let me."
Jill opens the door and motions him in. She senses a change in him. He is not like when she last saw him. Jill asks "You OK?"
Adam: "Yes.  Much better than when I last saw you.  And I am sorry for all of that	it was my fault and I just wanted to let you know that, and...well	I have been watching your news show every day lately. You have changed my mind about what I believe, which was not very much about anything before. But now I see that we missed our Messiah. I am now a believer."
"That's wonderful!" Jill said, so happy to hear her own brother had changed his mind, and also because of her message to her viewers. She thinks that is at least two people she has helped see the Truth, her news Producer Jack Ford and now her brother. The two talked for a while and then Adam said he would come see her again tomorrow at the studio. Maybe he could help out or be useful somehow.
As Adam left, Jill had a sense that she was not the failure she had thought she had been, and that her news show served a purpose. A real purpose.
CHAPTER 23
JEWS IN HIDING BECOME RESTLESS

In the mountains east of Israel the leaders of the Jews who fled during the Midpoint are gathered for their weekly council meeting. They had been hiding in the mountains for over two years now, and it was wearing on the people in the camp. The people were becoming restless. Many began to wonder about why they were there. Some began to stir up the camp with talk of going back to rescue their fellow Jews who were suffering intensely. Others simply did not like being cooped up in one place.
Josh Simmons begins the council meeting of the twelve Camp Leaders by saying: "Discontent is growing among our people here in the camps. They have heard all the reasons why we are here, but they do not fully understand their purpose. Some are stirring up the people to break from the group and form their own council, and possibly even leave the camp and go back to Israel. We must encourage the people, and also be steadfast in our resolve to keep good order in the camp. We do not want a repeat of the incident from a year ago when many set out for Jerusalem and were killed." The council discusses how they might keep the people from losing focus, and avoid discontentment that might lead to groups breaking off and going out on their own. But there is not agreement among all council members. Some even expressed sympathy for those who were discussing departing the camp, or possibly going back to Jerusalem to help their fellow Jews.
Josh continues: "The Tribulation is entering its final phase, which is characterized by a period of "the Woes," which are judgments by torturing demons who will inflict great pain and later death on the world's populace. But we here in the camps are protected from the Woes as long as we remain faithful, mainly by staying where we are, and by refusing the Mark of the Beast."
Josh continues "The first four Trumpet Judgments targeted nature, and therefore mankind indirectly, especially unbelieving mankind. Billions have been killed while the rest are starving, thirsty, freezing, diseased and mostly in the dark on a stinking, rotting, ugly planet. Misery would seem to be at a peak, but it will get much worse. And what happens during the remaining three judgments will be something the masses of unbelievers are not expecting. In fact, the next Trumpet Judgments are called “Woes” for a very good reason. Misery will now be taken to new heights. They are described in Revelation After Josh had finished one member of the council objected. Noam Givan had not been happy with the leadership of the other council members, and he spoke for those in the camp who saw things differently. Noam spoke to the council: "How long shall we sit here and let our fellow Jews back in Israel be imprisoned, tortured, and killed at the hands of these evil Goi heathen? We must mount a resistance and go back to help them. We sit here in comfort and have enough food and water while our dear friends back in our homeland are suffering. A number of people in my part of the camp believe we are cowards to sit here and not help our suffering fellow Jews. We must return to Jerusalem and fight with them."
Josh tries to reason with Noam. "We must remain unified and encourage everyone to stay in place as the Bible commands us. To leave the camp is certain death. We have Divine protection here. The enemy knows where we are but they cannot reach us because God has covered us. But if any leave this place, that coverage will not go with them."
Matthew 24 says:
“At that time if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘There he is!’ do not believe it. 24  For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have told you ahead of time. 26  “So if anyone tells you, ‘There he is, out in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. 27  For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.”
Josh Simmons: "The time to depart will be very clear to all. Until then, we are commanded by the Scriptures to remain and wait patiently on the Lord."
Noam Givan simply shakes his head and walks out of the council meeting. Josh and several others stay behind and discuss the issue further. Another member of the Council speaks up to support what Josh has said:
"Satan will continue to try to lure us out into the open to be killed.  If we remain in the mountains we will be safe under a supernatural hiding.  But if any come out they will be killed. We must survive to populate the Millennium, and we only need to wait another 18 months, which will be 3 ½ years from the time of our flight to these mountains.  We believers will be very tempted to come out of hiding to help our fellow Jewish believers still in Israel since they will be under attack and in great distress.  But any such intended heroism would be  misplaced, since we would never get the chance to help, but would instead be killed as soon as any come out from hiding.  Sometimes hiding is the heroic act, if that is what God requires.
God has a plan, and it must be followed precisely during these difficult times. Some must flee and wait, others must persevere and fight. Misplaced heroism will not be rewarded. We must remain until the Second Advent has occurred, and it will not be possible to miss that event."
The members depart for their sections of the encampments. But they know this is not the end of the issue. Patience is in short supply in the camps.
The following day a large crowd of Jews are gathered around Noam Givan as he speaks. He talks of the suffering of their fellow Jews back in Israel, and how staying in the camp is cowardly. The crowd becomes worked up and is ready to accept his message. They want to be patriots.  They want to return and fight.  As Noam finishes his speech he yells "I am going back to fight the enemy -- who is with me?" Cheers go up from the crowd as many shout their support for mounting a guerrilla action against the enemy in order to help their countrymen. They are ready to return and fight.
Josh Simmons had been listening from a short distance away. He knew that Noam would stir up trouble. Josh jumps up onto the stage and shouts "Silence! Silence! Listen to me!" The crowd shouts boos and jeers at Josh, but he continues" "Good people of Israel, we are here because it is the Lord's will that we must serve as a remnant of believers to populate the Millennial Kingdom. The Bible says that if any leave this place of hiding and divine protection they will certainly be killed. Their lives will be forfeited for no purpose. We must remain here as the Bible commands. We are not cowards to obey the Word of Truth. We must obey or perish. Anyone who leaves will be killed by the forces of evil and for no purpose at all. If you think us to be cowards, then you think the Word of the Lord is nothing. The command to us is very clear. Remain and wait patiently. We are being tested for our patience, and it is hard for all of us. To leave is a useless death. This is your final warning. No one can leave here until the Lord Himself returns, and it will not be long. He will provide for our fellow Jewish believers who are in Israel. He does not want or need your help. Choose wisely."
Many of the Jews calm down and accept that Josh has made a point. But others refuse to accept his guidance. Noam Givan recruits any who will join him to go back and help the Jews in Israel who are suffering and dying in large numbers. They set a date for departure.
Meanwhile, they train for their mission. They believe their mission will receive the Lord's blessing since they are seeking to help their fellow Jews in distress. They see themselves as patriots.
Within a month the departure date arrives. Noam and his group seem well trained and committed to fulfill their goal of helping their distressed fellow Jews.  They depart after sunset, with the goal of reaching Jerusalem by dawn. All goes well as they make their way down the mountains and across the Jordan River. As they approach Jerusalem, things go very badly.
The forces of the Antichrist are waiting for them. Surveillance systems picked up their departure from the enclave as soon as they had departed. They were tracked all the way down the mountains and across the Jordan River.
The Antichrist forces are entrenched along a road just east of Jerusalem. As the Jewish contingent made their way down the road, the leader of the Antichrist forces gives the order to open fire. A massive arsenal is unleashed on the band of Jews. Within two minutes all are dead.
Word of the disastrous defeat reaches the Jews back in Petra. Josh simply relays the news without comment. It is a hard lesson to the remaining Jews that they must remain in hiding, or face certain death for no reason.
