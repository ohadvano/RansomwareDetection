As long as he isn't sneering at me then I guess we're making progress. Kellan stands with his back to me looking out into the woods while Silver stands beside Ryder; looking flirtatiously at him. Ryder looks at me with an expression I can't figure out. I stare back at him, but look down when I notice Silver placing her manicured hand on his bare chest. Why all of a sudden do I feel so territorial?
After what happened last night between us, I would've thought that we had somewhat of an understanding with where we stood with one another, but with the looks of things, he's not quite ready to let Silver know how he really feels.
The silence is broken when unexpectedly a womanly gasp breaks the stare I have on Ryder's chest to see that he has a firm grip around Silver's throat. Silver looks at him in desperation to let her free but Ryder shows no sign of letting her go just yet. I look to see Bane staring at them with a disinterested look while Kellan places his hands on his hips waiting for this moment to be over.
“That's the last time you do something like that, understand?” Ryder says to her in a serious tone.
Silver looks taken aback as she stares back at him with a look of confusion. With what happened last night I'd probably have the same reaction, so I don't really blame her for that.
Doesn't make me pity her though!
He lets go of her throat causing her to stumble backwards and walks to stand in front of me.
“Today's all about you. It's a chance for you to let your wolf go and explore the areas around the property.
Hopefully, she'll gather a sense of freedom while she's at it.”
