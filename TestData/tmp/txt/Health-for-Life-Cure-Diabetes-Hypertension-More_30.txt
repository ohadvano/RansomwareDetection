chloride, sulfate, chlorohydrate, although zinc, zirconium and other compounds are also

found. In composition and action, antiperspirants are very similar to facial astringents.

Antiperspirants contain astringents that swel and coagulate protein in the skin, thus

reducing the pores through which perspiration is discharged. Astringents are composed of



97

various aluminum salts. This aluminum is readily absorbed through the skin, and we know

that aluminum is a poison to the human body.

Cleanliness is the first step in combating perspiration. A daily bath or shower

(preferably at night) fol owed by thorough rinsing is mandatory. Also drinking a minimum of

2 quarts of water daily wil help

keep the blood stream clean which wil reduce the amount of poisons the skin has to

eliminate.

A natural deodorant one could use is a fresh lemon cut in half and rubbed under the

arms; or one can find a few good natural deodorants in Health Food Stores. Be sure to

read the labels for the list of ingredients to determine if it real y is natural.

DIABETES





About 10 mil ion persons in the United States have diabetes, although almost half

of them are unaware that they are diabetic. Three out often diabetics end up in the

hospital every year. Eight out of ten diabetics develop eye problems. Diabetes is the

leading cause of new blindness. Diabetics are eighteen times more likely to experience

severe kidney damage than are non-diabetics: 25 percent of kidney dialysis patients are

diabetics. Diabetes more than doubles the risk of heart disease and stroke.

There are two types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is cal ed insulin-dependent

diabetes or juvenile diabetes. The onset is sudden in children and young adults and

accounts for about 20 percent of al known cases of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is known

as non insulin-dependent diabetes or Adult onset diabetes. This type affects people of

middle-age and older. Of this group at least 90 percent are obese.



SYMPTOMS

The most common symptoms of diabetes include constant hunger, frequent

urination, being always thirsty, weakness, loss of weight, mental depression, dry red

tongue, blindness, irritability, restlessness and poor circulation. Not al these symptoms

are present in every case.

The normal blood sugar is 80-120 mg/dl., but can rise after a meal up to 150

mg/100 ml. of blood. When the blood sugar exceeds 180, it wil spil over into the urine. To

excrete the sugar, water is taken from the tissues causing frequent urination and

increased thirst. The appetite is often increased because we are not ful y utilizing the food

we normal y eat.

A diabetic coma is caused by not enough insulin, causing high blood sugar.

Symptoms are headache, thirst, frequent urination and fatigue. The face becomes red, the

skin hot and dry, and the breath has a sweetish odor. Nausea and vomiting sometimes

occur. Respirations become rapid and the pulse increases. If insulin and fluid are not

given immediately the person wil lose consciousness.

Insulin shock is caused by too much insulin causing low blood sugar. Its symptoms

are nervousness, pal or, hunger, perspiration and behavior that resembles intoxication. If a

complex carbohydrate (such as ripe fruit) is not given promptly, the individual becomes

drowsy, disoriented and eventual y unconscious.

In 1981 diabetics in the United States needed the glands of 56 mil ion animals to

meet their insulin needs. To produce a single pound of animal insulin, the amount required

to maintain approximately 750 diabetics for a single year, 8,000 pounds of glands from

23,500 animals were required. In the past, insulin was obtained in tiny amounts

exclusively from the glands of pigs and cattle supplied by slaughter houses.



Insulin, a preparation used in the medical treatment of diabetes, is prepared from

animal pancreas, usual y pork or beef; there is also human insulin available. Orinase,

Tolinase, Diabinese or Dymelor are oral medicines which many Type 2 diabetics take.

These medicines are not insulin, but drugs that stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin.

There are many natural ways to stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin without taking

the drugs which have side effects.



NATURAL WAYS TO HELP

Diet - There is not a known remedy that wil cure diabetes without a reformation

along the lines that caused it. The number one dietary consideration for diabetes must be

a strict vegetarian, low calorie, alkaline diet of high quality natural foods. Plenty of whole

grains, bran and oatmeal are very beneficial in diabetes, as wel as raw vegetables of al

kinds - red cabbage, cauliflower, watercress, brussel sprouts, okra, cucumbers, onions,

etc. A big emphasis needs to be placed on raw foods as they stimulate the pancreas and

increase insulin production. Green beans and cucumber juice contain a hormone needed

by the cel s of the pancreas in order to produce insulin. No table sugar should be used.

When sugar is eaten and absorbed into the blood stream, it requires insulin and a trace

element cal ed chromium to move the sugar from the blood stream into the cel s where it

can be burned for energy. In the diabetic the insulin is missing. Therefore sugar piles up in

the blood stream and cannot move into the cel . When insulin is given, the sugar is able to

move into the cel and the sugar level wil drop in the blood stream. If chromium is missing,

the blood sugar wil rise again, for the sugar is stil not able to enter the cel . Chromium is

available in many natural foods (especial y whole grains), but most of it is removed when

foods are refined. The average American diet is lacking in chromium. At birth we have a

good supply of chromium, but as we get older we gradual y lose it if we do not eat

properly. Many older individuals are deficient in chromium. Why is this happening? When

refined sugar is eaten, it requires chromium to be utilized. If none is taken in with food,

chromium from the body stores, if available, has to be used. Thus chromium is gradual y

depleted and sickness occurs.



What about fresh fruits, as they contain sugar? Fresh fruits of al kinds are excel ent

for the diabetic.(1) The sugar in fresh fruit is fructose sugar and is very different from the

refined table sugar (which is sucrose sugar). When we eat sugar or starch our body

breaks it down into simple sugar and the blood then carries it to the cel s of the body. For

this simple sugar to enter the cel s it needs insulin and chromium, but if you have eaten

only fructose sugar (the good kind that is found only in fresh fruits), no insulin is needed

for the sugar to enter the cel s. This is why a diabetic can eat al the fresh fruit desired, but

no canned or frozen fruit juices (even if they are supposedly al natural). Al of these are

refined; they have been heated (even the frozen ones) and are hard for a diabetic to

assimilate.

Use no free fats - only natural fats as found in avocados, nuts, etc. Recent studies

show excess fat intake can decrease the number of receptors and/or deactivate them.

This results in the gradual build up of sugar in the bloodstream. Dr. James Anderson, one

of the most respected authorities on diabetes in the world, did a study with Dr. Kiehm.

They took thirteen diabetics off the 34 percent fat, 23 percent protein diet prescribed by

the American Diabetes Association and fed them a 9 percent fat diet of mostly natural high



100

fiber, starchy foods. Blood sugar levels were significantly lowered in al thirteen. Al five

patients taking oral drugs and four of the eight patients taking insulin were able to

discontinue their medication completely. (2)



Diabetics should discontinue the use of baking powder or soda, as these decrease

the activity of the pancreatic juices, which are used in the body to digest protein, fats and

carbohydrates. The pancreas is one of the most important organs of digestion.



Fasting is usual y not advisable for diabetics. Avoid al mental nervous stresses and

strains. Avoid constipation; the bowels must be kept loose with at least three good

eliminations every day. This is imperative to improved health.





Herb Tea - Tea, made from any one of the fol owing herbs is beneficial: raspberry

leaves, red root or dandelion root. Mix one tsp. of herb per 8 oz. of distil ed water. Let

steep for 20 minutes or longer. Drink three cups daily.





Exercise - Exercise wil lower the blood sugar and enable the diabetic to require

less insulin.(3) Deep breathing and lots of exercise of hard physical labor wil help keep the

fire of the metabolic processes burning fast, and this wil diminish the need for insulin.



Sunlight - The effect of direct sunlight on the body's sugar metabolism paral els

that of insulin. Sunlight facilitates the absorption of glucose into the cel s of the body and

stimulates the body to convert its blood sugar (glucose) into stored sugar (glycogen).(4)

This is minimal in a normal individual but dramatic in diabetics. A diabetic must gradual y

expose his body to the sunlight. Diabetics who choose to sunbathe should always keep in

touch with their physician as their insulin dosage wil have to be decreased.

In conclusion, diabetes is unknown in countries where people can't afford to

overeat. Americans may be the richest people in the world, but they are also one of the

sickest. In America, a new diabetic is discovered every 50 seconds. I want to encourage

al to eat in moderation, only those things that are wholesome and natural.
