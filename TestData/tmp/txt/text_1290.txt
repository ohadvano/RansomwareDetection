Chapter 16

Arriving at Ryder's place early the next morning wasn't something I was looking forward to doing. I've realized that I'm giving a lot of my time to Ryder lately, and I'm starting to think that his presence doesn't bother me as much as it should. Although being around him makes me feel somewhat safe, I do believe that he can also be one of the most dangerous people if he was ever threatened, which takes me back to Max.
When I climb out of my mother's car and walk slowly towards the house, I can't help but feel anxious about how today's gonna go. Last night's revelation was unexpected, but my mother's words are still haunting me and because of that, I believe that things are going to be very different from now on.
As the house comes into view, it seems odd that I was only here last night. The place shows no sign that a party was being held here, so when I see the glass surrounding the house, I check around to see if anyone's nearby until I realize that nobody is around the property.
I'm not the type of person to just walk into a house like it's my own, so when my attention is drawn from the sound of a door closing I exhale in relief.
I see Kellan standing by the door, wearing nothing but black jeans, he smiles at me but it doesn't reach his eyes which immediately makes me think that something is bothering him.
When I meet him where he stands, he welcomes me with a hug that I instantly accept. We break away and I notice that he's looking at me in concern.
“You okay?” His question takes me back to last night where I see Max's bloodied body on my table and the truth about his mother.
