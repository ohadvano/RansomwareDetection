
That evening when I arrive at the diner, it's the same as it's always been. Practically empty.
I'm surprised to see that Robbie's actually working for once. He's seated himself behind the cashier speaking on the phone. He waves to me just as I pass him to go into the changing rooms.
I quickly change into my black shorts, my red t-shirt, white apron and tidy my braid before going out into the diner.
I grab an order pad and stand at an elderly couple's table.
“Good afternoon, can I take your order?” I smile at the old man who's squinting at the specials.
I chuckle and read out the specials, “The specials today are the vegetable soup, curry, chilli con carne, squid and bolognese.”
“What's the curry, dear?” The old woman asks. “We have Korma, Rogan Josh or the Pasanda.”
“Richard, shall we have the Rogan Josh?” He mumbles just as the woman answers, “We'll have the Rogan Josh please, dear.”
