have normal PSA test. The rate of positive test for men with no cancer is even

higher.

â€¢ The positive PSA tests foster lots of biopsies to test further for prostate cancer.

When biopsies are positive, many if not most doctors wil opt for a radical

prostatectomy. The risks of this procedure are severe. Within a month, 8% of men

wil suffer cardiovascular complications and 2% wil die. Impotence, bladder

problems and bowel obstruction are not uncommon.

â€¢ Dr. Frank Hinman, Jr. of the University of California, San Francisco School of

Medicine, observes that mass screening of prostate cancer in elderly men may

have more risks than benefits.



While 2.5% of men die of prostate cancer, the greatest proportion of men screened

for prostate cancer may be subjected to unnecessary stress and anxiety, expensive

diagnostic testing and unnecessary treatment. (Internal Medicine News 24(21)52,

November 1-14, 1991)

SUGAR AND HONEY



In 1882, the average American ate 2 teaspoons of sugar per day. In 1870, it was 11

teaspoons per day. In 1980, we consumed 35 teaspoons of sugar per day; and now the

average is over 42 teaspoons per day. (See chart on Sugar Content of some popular

foods).



WHAT IS SUGAR?

Sugar is a carbohydrate that occurs natural y in various forms in al living things. In

its natural form, sugar, as found in the sugar cane or sugar beet, is combined with a large

amount of fiber, and also contains iron, potassium, calcium, B vitamins, etc.. These

nutrients are needed to digest the sugar that is in the sugar beet or sugar cane, However

white sugar, as we get it today, has been robbed of almost 100% of these nutrients. White

sugar is so pure and refined that it basical y has nothing in it but 'empty calories'.

Concentrated, pure sugar is a drug, unrelated to anything that occurs natural y, and

is very harmful to your body. According to John Yudlin, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Nutririon

at London University, "If only a smal fraction of what is known about the effects of sugar

was revealed in relation to any other food additive, that material would be promptly

banned".

Sugar throws off the calcium-phosphorous balance, and disrupts the entire

important phase of your body machinery. Because refined sugar has been robbed of the B

vitamins that are necessary for its assimilation by the body, it latches on to these wherever

it finds them - namely, in your digestive tract, so that the person who eats refined sugar is

bound to be short on the B vitamins. Result? Nervousness, skin troubles, digestive

trouble, and a host of other disorders which lead to much more serious problems later on.

The more sugar you eat, the lower your body's resistance to disease becomes. To

have good health we must have a strong immune system. Sugar lowers our body's

immune system, making it weak instead of strong. In our body we have white blood cel s,

which are cal ed warrior cel s. These attack and destroy bacteria. However, when we eat

refined sugar, it causes our white blood cel s to become sluggish, causing them to lose

their ability to destroy as many bacteria.

In a healthy body, where no refined sugar is eaten, one white blood cel can destroy

14 bacteria. If a person then eats 12 teaspoons of sugar (a 12 oz. bottle of Cola has 10

teaspoons), one of their white blood cel s wil only be able to destroy 5.5 bacteria. If a

person eats 24 teaspoons of sugar (a banana split has 25 teaspoons of sugar), one of

their white blood cel s wil only be able to destroy 1 bacteria. This weakening effect on the

white blood cel usual y lasts for approximately 5 hours. To keep our body's immune

system strong, we must leave sugar alone.



Refined sugar drains out the mineral salts of the blood, bones, and tissues. It

causes hyperactivity and dental caries. It causes obesity, diabetes, low blood sugar, high

blood pressure, duodenal ulcers, fatty livers, coronary and vascular disease, gout,

dermatitis, and cancer. According to the American Journal of Hypertension (3:560-562,

1990), sucrose (sugar) intake may increase the blood pressure. Other studies have

indicated that the intake of refined carbohydrates produces an increase in the blood

pressure.
