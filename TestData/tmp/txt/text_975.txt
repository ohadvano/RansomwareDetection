“And what about you Bane? Will you be the one to tell me what I said yesterday?”
Bane looks at him with distaste. “Nope.”
Mr. Edmund chuckles and walks to the classroom door. “Seeing as this lesson has not gone to plan, class is dismissed.”
Students begin to gather their things and rush to leave the classroom. I look at Sam in confusion to see her smiling as she gets up from her seat and leaves the room. She's probably waiting for me outside the class so that she can beg me to go to the party with her tonight.
Just as I get up from my chair, Mr. Edmund closes the door so all that's left in the classroom is me, and the four wolves.
“You three can keep me company at detention starting from 2:30 in here.” He then looks at Kellan and Silver. “You two clearly know how to listen better than these three.”
He smirks as he opens the door. “Hopefully this time you won't forget, otherwise there will be serious consequences.”
I couldn't eat during lunch break. The thought of eating anything made me feel nauseas. Sam kept begging me and begging me to go tonight and after continuously saying no to her, she just wouldn't give up. I gave up after the hundredth time and told her that I would go, but only for a little while. To say that she was happy was an understatement. She screamed so loud in the cafeteria, everyone was staring at her.
After lunch, Sam told me that she'd be leaving early in preparation for tonight because she wants to look perfect for Bane even though she looks pretty good in absolutely anything.
