
The rest of the night passed by in a blur. I kept to myself spending most of the night in one of the spare bedrooms thinking about how tomorrow would go. I recall about the last time I spoke with Max and how we left things that night when he kissed me. It was only for a second but it felt so much longer. The feeling that I'll have to face him tomorrow makes me uneasy and I wish I knew what will happen when we finally confront Max about his lies.
The moment the call ended with my mother, I went in search for Ryder and asked him if there was a place I could rest for the night. He showed me to a substantial room that I'd be staying in for the next few nights and assured me that if I needed anything to just ask him. He told me that dinner would be at six o'clock to which I informed him that I would stay in the room for the rest of the night. The moment he left the room I glanced around at the bedroom and took in the beautiful decor.
The purple painted walls decorated with various sizes of flowers with a four poster bed placed opposite the large window overlooking the forest. Two bedside tables placed neatly at both sides of the bed with a chaise lounge resting at the end of the bed that has neatly piled clothes resting on top of it. I walk to the left side of the room and notice a bookshelf holding various novels that are obviously suited for a young teenaged girl.
Whoever owns this room sure likes to read about vampires and romance.
Who could this room possibly belong to?
I chuckle to myself and look at the clock hanging on the right side of the room to see that it's 5:30 pm. I wonder if the wolves are preparing themselves dinner or if they're already eating. I'm actually surprised that after today they have an appetite.
To think about it, today wasn't how I imagined things would go and it's all been very draining. The world lost a good person today, and it will be hard for me to accept that he's gone. Work will be different from now on and what makes things worse is that Robbie probably won't even know where his most reliable worker has gone.
The fact that myself and a few other people know exactly what happened to Terry makes me feel guilty. I wish I could tell people the truth about what's going on in this town.
