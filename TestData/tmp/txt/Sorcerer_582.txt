“And that’s why you were going to capture me and rape me?” said Gatril.
“What? No!” Kiran waved his hands dismissively. “I wasn’t gonna rape you! That’s terrible! I’m still a virgin!”
“Then how did you plan on getting my queex?” said Gatril. “In order to get my queex you would’ve had to stimulate me so I can orgasm.”
Kiran nervously rubbed his hands together. “Well,” he looked at a stone on the ground, “I was planning to use my fingers.”
Gatril’s eyes lit up. “Really?” She noticed the key words in his statements, and painted a picture of the young man. “Do you live with your parents, boy? What’s your name?”
“My name is Kiran,” he said. “My father works at a carpeting company. My mother’s a farmer.”
Gatril sat forward, regarding Kiran with intense inhuman eyes that arouse more of his unease. “You sound like a well-off boy, Kiran?”
“Kinda,” he said. “How would you know about human jobs?”
Gatril chuckled. “Do you think you’re the first human I’ve met. For as long as I can remember humans have been coming in contact with beasts. Most hunt us down for our power. Only a very rare few treat us with compassion.”
Kiran hung his head, his eyes losing the willingness to look at Gatril. “I’m sorry,” he said. “This was my first-time hunting anything—anyone. I didn’t know what to do.”
Gatril slowly rose and approached Kiran. He didn’t run, not that he could out-speed her anyway. But he didn’t seem startled. Gatril looked him up and down quizzically. He seems firmly built, she thought. Well, he is a farm boy.
“So are you going to kill me now?” Kiran said.
Gatril shook her head. “No.” She ran her fingers across his cheek, feeling the warmth of his flesh. “I’ve decided I’m going to have some fun with you.”
Kiran arched his spine upon feeling a tingling sensation. “What kind of fun are you talking about?”
Gatril, wearing a fleshy smile, said, “I knew a human once. A man. He was, interesting. I want to see if you can take his place. Meet me here tomorrow at the same time. I’ll help you with your spells.”
“R-Really?” said Kiran, unable to hide his excitement. “I mean…you’re not afraid I’ll just runaway and never comeback?”
“Oh, you’ll return,” said Gatril. “A responsible sorcerer wouldn’t let an opportunity like this pass, would he?”
“No, I wouldn’t!” Kiran’s smile was big and toothy. “Oh wow! Thank you!”
“Stop kissing my ass and go home and get ready,” said Gatril, “we have a long day ahead of us tomorrow.”
Kiran hurriedly took up the parts of his cannon and clutched them under his arms. He gave Gatril one last glance before he hurried to the edge of the jungle.
As promised, Kiran returned the next day. The jungle itself was fifty acres, surrounded by the town on both sides with only a river at the north and south that connected it to distant jungles and forests within the country of Tatanui.
Kiran’s method of transport was a quacycle, a four-wheeled vehicle with a large seat and trolley at the back as the main centerpiece, held within a metal. It also had a large steam engine beneath it, with exhaust pipes jutting out the back.
It was sixty years ago since the world was plunged into the industrial revolution, and small engines like these were becoming widely marketed. Kiran just got his for his sixteenth birthday from his parents, albeit he had to put up some of the money from the odd jobs he was doing through the town; paperboy, yard sweeper, fruit picker and stable boy.
But it was having to put himself through such tasks that gave Kiran joy in his quacycle, and he scribbled his name all over the vehicle and decorated it with red paint and small banners of symbols of the arcane
Kiran stopped a few yards inside the jungle and switched a knob near the steering wheel, turning off the engine. He tied it to a tree with a lock and key and took his knapsack out of the cart. He had hastily repaired his cannon yesterday, only needing to weld the barrel back to the body. Now his focus was on accomplishing his first spell with Gatril’s help.
With giddiness Kiran jogged through the trees with his staff in hand and cannon and knapsack slung across his back. In the distance he spotted a small herd of deer grazing, when they suddenly popped their heads up and looked at him.
Expecting them to run away from the potential predator, one of the deer’s head snapped to the side, an arrow stuck in its eye. 
Kiran yelped and dove behind a tree. The deer fell and the others scattered out of sight. Kiran reached for his cannon in preparation for a potential conflict, when he saw the culprit who had fired the projectile in the skull of the herbivore.
They were diminutive, noisy, painted their pale skin on the chests and shoulders and wore clothing of simple loin clothes over their genitals. All these were the traits of a typical a batoiko. They were a group of people of only four feet in height, who also wore masks with hollow eyes and horrible expressions of tortured faces. They were made up of different tribes, seven of which lived within the country of Tatanui. 
They chattered around the dead deer with spears and knives in hand. One of them with a bow kicked the corpse of the animal. Met with no response, the male batoiko leaped onto the carcass and shouted in a garbled tongue. The other men and women shouted with the same synergy. 
Kiran doubted the excitement was due to this being their first kill, and rather their relish of the act. But he wasn’t going to stick around to see if they liked hunting people as well. He was well aware of the batoiko’s existence in the jungle, which was another reason why he brought along his weapon.
With a rehearsed pace the batoiko lifted the deer over the heads of four of them and hurried off out of sight. But one of them, a female by the proportions of the body and the small, bulging breasts, lingered behind.
Kiran folded behind the tree before she could look in his direction. The boy held his breath, and to how hard his heart was beating in his chest, wished he could silence it too before the batoiko heard him.
Seconds passed by, but Kiran didn’t dare look from around his hiding place. Then he heard the footsteps in the leaf litter plow away. When Kiran was certain he couldn’t hear the footsteps anymore, he cautiously peeped from behind the tree. 
And as Kiran walked from behind his cover, the batoiko fell from the tree upon him, dropping Kiran with a blow to his shoulder.
