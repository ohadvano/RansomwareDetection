I pause for a second. “Kellan, do you mind if I ask you a question?”
“Anything.”' He answers without looking at me.
“The other night at my house, why were your eyes different from Bane and Silver's?”
Kellan puts the menu down, “I was turned less than a year ago, a few months after Anna's death. When Ryder changed me, he wanted me in his pack, but after losing Anna I just wanted to be left alone. Ryder would check up on me at school, to see if I was okay and he always told me that he'd be there whenever I needed him. A couple of weeks later, I decided to go and see him and that's when I met Bane and Silver. Ryder wasn't there and it was obvious that they didn't want me anywhere near him or the pack. So, they did what Betas do. They forced me out of the pack.”
I frown. “Can they do that?”
“As second in commands they can. Ryder didn't know anything about it until he asked them why my scent was there, and they told him. I was on my own for a while keeping to myself and keeping away from everyone. That didn't last because Ryder told me about how Omegas don't survive on their own, and he brought me back to his pack. And for my eyes? They're yellow because I'm the weaker one out of them all. For example, if we're fighting with another pack, they can see who the easier target is, that being me, but my eyes will change eventually.”
“Wait, are you the only pack in Small Town?” I wheeze.
“No, Alice there are thousands of us.” Kellan smirks, “And soon you'll be one.”
I shake my head. “If I survive, which I probably won't.”
