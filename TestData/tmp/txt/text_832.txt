She didn't give me a chance to answer. Instead, she turns around and faces all the onlookers. “Didn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to stare? My mum always tells me to never stare at anybody because if you do, some people might not be as nice as I'm going to be.”
She turns around and shrugs at me when she sees the pure shock on my face. “I told you, I don't give a damn about what people think.”
I look inside my bag to see if I have everything only to realize that I don't have my pencil case. I reopen my locker when I hear Sam sigh.
“People still staring?”
“What? Oh, no just Ryder and his crew. They walk around here like they own the place, but seriously how does a guy even look that good?”
After I grab my pencil case, I shut my locker and look at my best friend, whose mouth is wide open.
“Sam! You're staring honey, and drooling.” I close her mouth, shove the pencil case in my bag and stare at them. Every single person moves to the side to make room for them to pass. You see, this gang does practically own the school, and if you hurt one of them, you hurt them all.
Everyone knows who they are and no one dares to try and talk to them or to even approach them. They walk side by side in a perfect line. Bane and Silver on the outside, with Kellan and Ryder in the middle.
Bane looks to be the most frightening one out of them all. He has an oval shaped face with small, blue piercing eyes. His mouth, full and firm with a constant sneer on his face. He has tanned skin with a warm, golden brown tint that accentuates his large muscular frame. His hair was thick, black and slicked down with both sides of his head shaved. Bane also had a black bushy beard decorating his face. It was hard sometimes to take him seriously with the beard because it kind of makes him look like a big old teddy bear, but if the rumors were true, you definitely shouldn't say that to his face, not unless you wanted to end up in A&E. He wears a plain white wife-beater that's low enough to show the hairs on his chest, and a long black necklace rests on his chest that looks like a triskelion. He wears black tight jeans with black ankle boots with a small heel.
