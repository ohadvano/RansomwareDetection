“Who's we?”
Ryder doesn't answer me. He only gives me this knowing look that gives me the realization that I need to know what he means by his expression.
“You're saying that Bane, Silver and Kellan are wolves? Come on, be serious?”
“You think I'd be helping you if you weren't becoming one of us? Your scent was all over that diner for any wolf to pick up on it.”
Ryder's hands are balled into fists as he stares at me with a dark evil glint in his eyes. I don't care if he's angry or frustrated with me. I just wanted to go home and forget this conversation ever happened.
I scoff in disbelief. “I'm not becoming one of you! This kind of thing just doesn't happen to people!”
“You what to know what happened to Mr Daniels!? How his body was found ripped to shreds in his own home!?”
I can't take this anymore, I do the only thing I can think of to block Ryder's voice. I cover my ears and pray that he stops.
“Stop it!”
