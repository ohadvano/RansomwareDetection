“Then, how do you explain Max's injuries? Did you know that he's on crutches?”
Kellan's voice starts to rise. “So, you think that we did it? If you do then you obviously don't know who we are.”
“Then why would he accuse you three and lie to me?” Kellan shrugs. “You're asking the wrong person.”
I remain silent.
Kellan looks at me sympathetically, turns around and join the others on the court.
Even though a part of me still thinks that Ryder had something to do with Max, Kellan does have a point. Maybe they had nothing to do with Max's injuries but then again, why would he lie to me in the first place?
I'm shaking my head by the time I walk into the cafeteria. I see Sam straight away at the salad bar filling up her plate with lettuce and cucumber. She sees the fury on my face and walks straight to me.
“Why do you look like you're about to kill someone?” “I'll tell you later after I've calmed down a bit.”
“That bad?”
