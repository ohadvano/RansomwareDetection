“Bultungins,” sneered Gatril. She forcefully flicked her tail around unpredictably, sending a message to the beasts one foul move would befall something horrible upon them.
They all wore various animal skins that had crudely torn edges, and all manner of trinkets that seemed to have sculpted by more skilled hands as opposed to the dirty, clawed ones of the bultungins.
Kiran knew the human crafts in particular the bultungins didn’t get by righteous means.
One with his mane dyed white approached them, eagerly tapping a femur tipped with an axe-head in his palm. He rose above them by inches, and the width of his shoulders told the pair a blow dealt by his hand would be fatal.
“Little meatballs,” he said, “you look like you’re a long way from home.”
“Yeah,” giggled one of the others, gesturing with his machete, “you tell ‘em boss.”
“Piss off!” said Gatril, keeping her eyes on the ones with blasters. “I’ll melt you all alive if you touch us!”
The leader grinned, and gobbets of saliva reeking of rotten flesh fell from his mouth. “Hey boy, hand over that quacycle and your stuff, or we’ll show you how our gang does things around here.”
Kiran touched Gatril, stealing her attention. She saw the glow of his spirit energy in the jewels on his staff, and face laced with concentration. She realized his stance wasn’t that of a coward seeking someone to save him from his demise, but a man trying to gather his bearings to access the situation.
Kiran wasn’t afraid anymore.
“Last warning,” said Kiran, unflinching, “leave us alone.”
Two of the bultungins charged and abruptly stopped, baring their teeth. It was a tactic meant to inject fear and unease into their targets, but Kiran’s countenance reflected his inward annoyance rather than the terror they’d hope to see.
Realizing this, the leader couldn’t let this standoff continue with words. He dropped his axe by his side, tensing his arm. “Don’t say I didn’t try to play nice. Get ‘em!”
And Kiran tapped the ground with his staff. Earthen walls sprung up with multiple quakes, catapulting two bultungin into the air and barricading Kiran and Gatril from their gunfire.
Gatril instantly followed up by jumping onto one of the walls and into a bultungin with a gun. She twisted her body and slapped him away with her tail. She sprinted on all fours, darting left and right, tripping them with her tail and cutting them open with her claws.
“Blast!” The leader turned and ran. “Let’s get outta here!”
The remaining two men fled with their boss. 
But Kiran wasn’t having it, and he holsters his staff and took out his cannon. Kiran aimed it at the bultungin running through the trees and fired with honed precision. The sticky blob knocked the leader in the head and grounded him.
Gatril darted after the others and leaped into the back of one with the force of a raging bull. She heard a loud snap of something vital to the beast, and switched to the other one. Gatril hawked up an acidic ball that splattered onto his back. The bultungin wailed at the sound of his sizzling flesh; like fresh lava had been poured onto him.
Kiran went to the quacycle to check if he had accidentally damaged his vehicle in the ruckus, while Gatril dragged the leader back to the side of the road.
Gatril tossed him by his foot unceremoniously before Kiran. “Start yapping,” she said.
The cowering bultungin raised his trembling hands before him as if he expected one of the two to stomp-in his face. “I-I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to attack you!”
“Where did you get all those ornaments?” said Kiran.
“We found them in a town up ahead,” he said. “It was overrun by the j’bafofi. The entire place has been murdered. The only people there are the dead ones. W-We just happened on it and found all this jewelry. Then they chased us out!”
“They…?” said Gatril.
“The males!” the beasts said, his lips wet with disdain. “The bastards chased us out. They want all the territory for themselves to farm food to impress the female.”
“Thanks for the information,” said Gatril, kicking the man in ribs. “Now get going!”
But the bultungin couldn’t move from the hellish pain Gatril inflicted on him, and the two simply went the quacycle and left the squirming gang of beasts. 
Another path veered off the main one into a hazed outline of buildings, and they followed it. Though the wind blew, the tees barely moved as if they were petrified, and the birds didn’t take to them either. But the closer Kiran and Gatril got, they saw the reason for this.
A galaxy of webs had been thrown over the trees like a white sheet stretched to the thinnest fiber. They knitted the leaves and branches dead stiff, preventing the grace of the winds from permitting them a swaying dance. Hung within them like the leftover of a demented child’s macabre play things were dried corpses of animals who’d fallen prey.
And on their path into the town, it was no different. The webs were all over the buildings, and Kiran decided he better save his vehicle from going further into the webbed museum and turned off the engine. He and Kiran got off, looking for anything that waited to surprise them. 
“Do you smell anything, Gatril?” said Kiran.
Gatril’s nose inhaled the choking smell of rotten wood, alkaline and something dead. “Nothing out of the ordinary,” she said. “I never picked up the scent of a j’bafofi before.
Kiran saw the unattended windows and doors. It ran across his mind to search them, but he remembered something about spiders. They were creatures of stealth, lying in wait for something to carelessly wonder into their trap of threads and deliver a paralyzing blow, leaving the prey defenses as its organs were liquified and consumed alive.
A most gruesome ending Kiran didn’t want him and his friend to fall to.
