He looks at me in pity. “He took away something from me Alice, and now I'm taking something away from him.” He stands from his chair.
I tremble from my position in the door and watch as Mr Edmund starts to breathe heavily when the sound of bones stretches the silence in the classroom. His jaw suddenly dislocates and develops into a vicious fanged mouth and soon after, his entire face structure transformers into a wolf, when hair starts to appear all over his body, I gasp in horror when I see that his eyes have turned blood red.
I whimper in absolute fright when it suddenly occurs to me that the colour of this wolf's fur looks oddly familiar - the dull shade of grey with big chunks of the fur missing, and the scars on its entire body. I feel like screaming when I realize that this wolf was the one that bit me the night of the full moon.
This all happened because of him.
When the wolf starts to prowl closer to me I know exactly what its intent is. I run out of the classroom door and down the corridor when the wolf lets out an ear bursting howl behind me, causing my heart to beat rapidly inside my chest. I exit out of the school with Sam's keys in my hands and run to the only car left in the lot. I manage to pick the right key and unlock the car in record speed. I see the wolf run out the doors of the school just as I close the door.
I turn on the ignition, drive away from the school and start to head home, breaking every speed limit along the way.
It takes me half an hour to drive home, and when it comes into view, I let out a sigh of relief. I stop the car and rest my head against the steering wheel. I stay in that position for a few minutes to steady my heart and breathing.
I turn my head to look at the house and notice that the front door has been left open.
Why would my mother leave the door wide open?
