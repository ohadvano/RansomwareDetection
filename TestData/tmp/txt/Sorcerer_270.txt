The width of the path grew as they went, seeming more befitting of the massive beast fabled to live inside here. Then they reached the end, but contrary to the fangs, claws and beady eyes they were expecting, a mass of corpses piled on top of each other stood at the end, waiting on them like some sick trick.
“Holy crap…” Kiran tried to contain the urge to vomit, triggered by the scent that burnt his lungs. 
“They’re hundreds of them,” said Gatril.
The corpses were a menagerie of humans, beasts and animals, like a deranged necromancer’s collection. The ones at the very bottom were nothing but bones infused with moss and other discoloration over time, while at the top the newcomers still had their skin, though it was shriveled, and with the impact of the moisture had sagged and fused with heat of the others as if they were all trying to become one—souls locked together in an embrace of death. 
Kiran pointed the light above the bodies, where they found a tunnel leading to probably the source of where all these remains came from.
Kiran shuddered as if he could feel multiple hairy legs on him. “It’s like this place is—”
“A dumpster,” Gatril finished. She saw rats scrabbling to the top where others nibbled at the scraps of flesh left. “Come. We should go.”
They went back to the beginning of the fork in the cave and took the other path. This one was larger, very. Big enough to permit an elephant passage. Gatril’s intuition gnawed at her body and she readied her cannon. Kiran drew his knife just for safe measure.
And it came so unsuspectingly that it had the same effect as something leaping out of the dark to bite them. A sweet tune, a hum that came from a throat of liquid crystal. It was soft and reassuring, like the lullabies Kiran’s mother would sing to him.
“What? Who is that?” Kiran wondered if the cave was playing tricks on him. The song was unbefitting of the accursed hole they’d wondered into. It had to be a trap; a siren’s song to lure wary sailors to their doom, as his grandfather would tell Kiran at night when he visited the old man.
And then came an orange glow from around the bed. Faint, flickering, casting jagged shadows on the walls.
“Are you sure we’re in the right place?” said Kiran.
Gatril gestured to the ground briefly. “The webs here are a bit fresh. And now that I know the scent of spiders, it’s like this one’s right under my nose.”
They closer they got the slowler their steps became. But it seemed by the room they found, they had been right to be so cautious in their approach.
A flame burnt in a bronze urn close to the wall, and the essence of freshly sundered wood and mint seeped from it. Thick branches were stuck to the walls of the chamber, holding enough books that seemed to be the humble beginnings of a library. In the corners of the room were trinkets, jewelry that sparkled from the grace of the flames. And in the center, there she was.
It was something humanoid, female in shape, but the body parts composed of jointed limbs and a segmented torso. She had four long arms, each ending in four digits, and her pelvis was squishy looking and pink, contrasting the brown of her chitinous body. The thighs were thick and attached to the outermost of pelvis, from which a long tail hung, tipped with spinnerets. Her six eyes were occupied by a book before, her mandibles clicking thoughtfully as she processed the information, and she briefly brushed back a lock of her black hair with a hand.
But the legs weren’t set in preparation for a lunging attack. The hands weren’t about to wring their necks, and her fangs weren’t dripping neurotoxin in the hindsight of puncturing their flesh. Even when she lifted her head from the book she was reading and spared them a glance, she looked away, only to do a double take as if surprised by who was there instead of the fact that they snuck up upon her.
“Who are you two?” she said, her voice high pitched but grainy.
“My name is Kiran Kehomba,” the boy said. “I’m sorcerer seeking the queex of a j’bafofi. I came here seeking your assistance.”
The six eyes turned to the bosdrake. “And who is this?” the spider said.
“I’m Gatril,” she said. “I’m his friend.”
The spider closed the book, and between her mandibles they could see her lips making a smile. “This is quite the surprise. I was just reading a tale about a human female, falling in love with a beast. To think I’d see something similar even here. The universe must like me.”
Kiran said, “I don’t mean to be rude, mam, but I want to ask you a few questions.”
“You come into my domain, and want to question me?” the spider narrowed her eyes.
Kiran and Gatril’s nerves went array, and their spines wanted out through their backs,
“Shit,” said Gatril. “Quick, Kiran offer to eat her crotch!”
Kiran was a stuttering wreck: “I-I-I-I—”
“Enough!” said Gatril. She approached the spider, flinching when she saw the size of her mandibles. Seven inches. The size of Kiran’s cock. “Now look here!” Gatril pointed, but her finger was too close to the spider’s face and she dropped it. “We just—”
The spider grabbed Gatril by the throat. Gatril tired prying her hand open but the spider’s strength was more than hears, a mighty dragon.
Kiran’s spine suddenly straightened in his back. “Gatril!” He approached the spider. His staff raised with orb for the force-counter pulsing. “Put her down! Please!”
“My,” the spider said, her mandibles salivating. “I’ve never had a dragon before.”
“Bitch!” Gatril squeaked.
“I said drop her!” Kiran boomed.
The spider finally recognized Kiran’s killing intent and payed him heed. She sensed a supernatural force emanating from his staff, and narrowed two of her eyes at him. “You’re a sorcerer…”
“That’s right,” Kiran said, trying his best to contain his rage. “Now put her down before I tear this place down!”
