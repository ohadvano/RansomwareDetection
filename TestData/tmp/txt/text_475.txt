She does it for a while but suddenly stops, she stares into the woods like she's trying to figure something out.
Did she hear something or did she sense danger nearby?
She slowly starts towards the clearing where all the wolves disappeared through and stop just outside it. The view before me is utterly breath-taking.
Tightly knit trees stare at me as though they seek permission from me to enter the forest. The scent of foliage mixed with decay and dampness tickle my senses, the bright sun above playing hide and seek in between the leaves of the trees. I don't realize that we've moved deeper into the forest until I hear a spine tingling howl coming from the other side of the forest.
When I think that she'll turn around, afraid of what she might come across, she instead decides to run towards the source.
We continue running until we come across the end of the path. She looks around at her surroundings - probably wondering where the howl came from. She inhales the ground when suddenly a noise of a twig breaks nearby. Her head shoots up in alert - waiting for a clear sign that she's safe.
Steady.
I don't know why I'm telling her to keep steady but with fur as white as snow and this height, there's no explaining to anyone about what they can see.
A few seconds go by when suddenly a fierce growl comes from behind us. In a second she turns around and faces whoever dared to approach her and the first thing I see are the blood red eyes of an Alpha and the black mass of fur. Ryder walks towards us with integrity - clearly showing who the strongest Alpha is. He circles around us, drawing closer and closer until the two bodies start to touch each other. All through this, she does not growl once. Instead, she lets the Alpha does what needs to be done.
