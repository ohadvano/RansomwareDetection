WHAT ABOUT HONEY?



Honey is not a disaccharide like sugar; it is a

monosaccharide which does not over-stimulate the

pancreas. Sugar, which comes from beets or cane, is

sucrose, a disaccharide, which over-stimulates the

pancreas. Sugar also must undergo digestion, a process

that changes it into simple sugar; whereas, honey is pre-

digested and takes a load of work off the stomach and

pancreas.



Honey is refined by the bees, whereas sugar is

refined by man under less than ideal conditions, for man is

not as careful or as diligent as the honey bee. Bees have to

col ect nectar from nearly two mil ion flower blossoms to

produce just one pound of honey. Bees are faithful and

diligent in their work of making honey. Of course, pure

organic raw honey is better than what you buy at the local



167

grocery store. Raw honey wil in a short time crystal ize because it has not been heated to

a high temperature and had al the enzymes destroyed. Honey also has more vitamins

and minerals than sugar. (See chart for comparison)
