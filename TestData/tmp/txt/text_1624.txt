Ryder turns to me and smiles brightly and places his hand gently on my knee. “You okay?” Something tells me that he's asking me if I'm okay after what happened last night.
I smile back at him. “Never better.” “I didn't hurt you, right?”
I lean forward in the passenger seat and press my lips against his. “It did hurt, but only for a little while.”
“Any regrets?”
I kiss him again. “Nope.”
He kisses me back and we both leave for class.
As I make my way towards English and round the corner, I see my best friend waiting casually outside the classroom. I call her name to see her looking not so impressed with me. “You know, best friends usually call or text each other on the weekends, but nothing from you. I may have to find another best friend.”
I run my hand through my hair. “I know, I'm such a terrible person. It was quite a weekend.”
Maybe now's not the time to say what happened to Terry.
