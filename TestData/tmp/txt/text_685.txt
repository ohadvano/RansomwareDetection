“It just happened and I can't believe I let it happen.”
Sam looks at me with a huge grin. “See? It's your libido.”
I pinch the bridge of my nose and close my eyes, “Okay, that's enough sex talk.”
“I'm just saying that your whole life is about to change, little virgin.” Sam smirks at me.
Being a virgin is really not that big of a deal. I've had boyfriends before but I'd rather give it to someone that I really care about and besides, there's no rush to losing it. I'm only eighteen and in no hurry; unlike Sam who lost her virginity at sixteen.
“I'm sure I'll be fine, Sam.”
Sam picks up her makeup and perfume and places them back on the dresser. “If you say so but believe me, you and Ryder were pretty hot together.”
“Sam!”
“Imagine doing it with a wolf though? With Bane. Do you think with him it would be rough sex with lots of sweat involved or slow passionate lovemaking?” Sam arches her brow at me.
