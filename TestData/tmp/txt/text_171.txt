Silver laughs. “He deserved it. He accused Ryder, Bane and Kellan for something that they didn't do and came here unannounced. I mean seriously, he had it coming”
“Silver get out.”
Silver stops laughing instantly. “What?”
“Get the hell out!” Ryder yells, causing a shiver to run down my back.
Silver scurries to pick up her shoes off the floor and runs out of the room.
“Shut the door.” Ryder commands as he lounges on his black leather couch.
“No, I'm good here.”
I can sense that he's growing impatient with me but after tonight, he's changed to being a completely different person to whom I thought he was before, “Shut the damn door and sit down, Alice.”
“Don't tell me what to do! What you did tonight was brutal and horrific! Why would you do something like that!? Do you realize that Max could've died or do you not care at all? He's not an Alpha like you, so stop whatever grudge you have against him and let it go!”
