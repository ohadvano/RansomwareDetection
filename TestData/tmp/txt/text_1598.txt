I walk into the wolves' house, dial my mother's number and wait patiently for her to answer.
Chapter 19

The rest of the night passed by in a blur. I kept to myself spending most of the night in one of the spare bedrooms thinking about how tomorrow would go. I recall about the last time I spoke with Max and how we left things that night when he kissed me. It was only for a second but it felt so much longer. The feeling that I'll have to face him tomorrow makes me uneasy and I wish I knew what will happen when we finally confront Max about his lies.
The moment the call ended with my mother, I went in search for Ryder and asked him if there was a place I could rest for the night. He showed me to a substantial room that I'd be staying in for the next few nights and assured me that if I needed anything to just ask him. He told me that dinner would be at six o'clock to which I informed him that I would stay in the room for the rest of the night. The moment he left the room I glanced around at the bedroom and took in the beautiful decor.
The purple painted walls decorated with various sizes of flowers with a four poster bed placed opposite the large window overlooking the forest. Two bedside tables placed neatly at both sides of the bed with a chaise lounge resting at the end of the bed that has neatly piled clothes resting on top of it. I walk to the left side of the room and notice a bookshelf holding various novels that are obviously suited for a young teenaged girl.
Whoever owns this room sure likes to read about vampires and romance.
Who could this room possibly belong to?
I chuckle to myself and look at the clock hanging on the right side of the room to see that it's 5:30 pm. I wonder if the wolves are preparing themselves dinner or if they're already eating. I'm actually surprised that after today they have an appetite.
