He points to the back. “Ryder and Silver in the front. Now. Liam and Luna go to the back. The middle row is fine as far as I'm concerned.”
Mr. Edmund waits until everyone is seated and clears his throat. “Now I won't be able to stay for the rest of the lesson because a new student was in an incident here yesterday, and I have to leave to speak with him. I don't know what happened but that person has been severely hurt. I'll be back as soon as possible.”
He collects his things and heads for the door. “I don't want anyone leaving this classroom under any circumstance. If I hear that any student has left this classroom, I will gladly mark every test paper of theirs an F.” He turns and leaves out the door without another word.
As soon as the classroom door closes, everyone starts to talk amongst themselves. I hear Mr Edmund's name mentioned several times. They're probably wondering the same thing as everyone else. What happened to him that's suddenly made him want to change the room around and behave this way?
I look back at Bane to see his eyes are closed tightly, sweat knits his forehead and he's taking deep breaths. Sam is talking to someone behind her and I can hear behind me that Kellan's talking to Silver and Ryder.
I slowly reach up with my hand and carefully place my hand on Bane's shoulder. The second it makes contact, his eyes immediately swing to me and stares motionless at me.
“Bane?” I whisper.
He stares at me but remains silent. I lean in closer. “Bane?”
“I'm....try...trying.....to control..my...myself.”He grunts. “Do you need me to do anything? Do you need some air?”
