Kiran and Gatril spun around with innocent smiles. â€œUmm, you might have misheard,â€ said Kiran. â€œWe were just talking about how pretty your vagina looks?â€
The spider flexed her arms. â€œYou donâ€™t have much of a choice,â€ she said. â€œEither teach me about magic and get my queex, or I trap you here until you change your mind. One scream, and all the males will come running in at my side.â€
â€œThen weâ€™ll just have to make this quick,â€ said Kiran, raising his staff.
The spider flicked her tail and unleashed her webs in an arc. Gatril and Kiran dove out of the way of the silky strands.
Kiran used his force-counter spell, but the jâ€™bafofi leapt into the ceiling. She uttered a high pitched clicking sound that froze Kiran and Gatril.
â€œShit!â€ Gatril said. She opened fire at the spider but the Jâ€™bafofi was too fast; scurrying over the surface of the room, spewing more webs that threatened to fill the area. Gatril quickly spat an acidic mist around her that melted the webs, and the jâ€™bafofi seized the opportunity, lunging with a kick that threw Gatril into the wall.
The spider hissed and lunged once more, only to have a column of rock punch her in the stomach. She winced and crumpled, quickly leaping into the ceiling.
Kiran lifted a large rock out of the floor again and launched it with his force-counter. â€œGot you!â€ he said.
But the jâ€™bafofi caught the rock and attached it to a thread of silk from her tail. â€œThank you,â€ she sneered.
Kiran felt something heavy drop in his gut when the spider threw the rock at him. Luckily Gatril already got up and dove with Kiran out of the way. The she-spider used the rock and silk like a flail, constantly trying to smashed the human and bosdrake, forcing them all over the room, tripping and kicking over books in their way.
â€œKiran!â€ said Gatril as she ducked beneath the flying rock. â€œGet me some higher ground!â€
â€œGot it!â€ said Kiran, tapping the floor and ascended Gatril atop a column. At this height Gatril got a better shot, and managed to put a round in the spiderâ€™s shoulder.
The jâ€™bafofi screamed and drop the rock, falling to the floor ground with brute force.
Gatril laughed. â€œStay down bitch!â€
But unbeknownst to the dragon, a single strand of silk as thick as her pinky had flowed from the spiderâ€™s tail and attached to Gatrilâ€™s foot. The dragon only found out when the spider yanked her tail and snagged Gatrilâ€™s footing from beneath her.
Gatril fell into the jâ€™bafofiâ€™s grasp. The spider held her arms and legs with all of hers. She brought Gatril closer to her impending, salivating fangs. Kiran leaped at the spider with his staff, only to have her tail coil around him.
However, Kiranâ€™s hand with the staff was free, and he looked to the ceiling with epiphany. I hope this works! Kiran thought, and he charged his staff with spirit energy and tossed it into the ceiling.
â€œI never ate a dragon before,â€ the spider said with insidious grin behind her fangs.
Gatril bore her teeth in defiance. She tried hawking up some more acid but her stomachâ€™s content had reached its limit. But that proved unnecessary, as Gatril has the pleasure of seeing a huge rock land in the jâ€™bafofiâ€™s head with a solid thonk sound.
The she-spiderâ€™s eyes rolled into her head. Her grip loosened and the bosdrake and human quickly stepped away from the beasts as she fell on her knees. 
Kiran took up his staff and said, â€œQuick, tie her up!â€
Gatril used her rifle as a club across the spiderâ€™s face, measuring the force so that it didnâ€™t cause further damage, but dealt enough force to knockout herâ€”which it did.
â€œBitch!â€ said Gatril.
Kiran and her quickly bounded the jâ€™bafofiâ€™s six arms and legs together, as well as her tail. They sat her up against the wall, where by the time she regained consciousness she was looking across at Kiran and Gatril whoâ€™d seated themselves on some of her books.
â€œWell look whoâ€™s up?â€ said Gatril, closing a book she had been reading. 
The jâ€™bafofi tried to lunge at Gatril but instantly met with the force of her restraints. â€œCurses!â€ The she-spider struggled, but Kiran and Gatril had used a good amount of webbing to tie her that wouldâ€™ve restrained even a raging bull.
â€œSave your energy, missy,â€ said Gatril. â€œBecause weâ€™re going to work you.â€
Kiran stood, and said, â€œPlease listen to what we have to sayâ€”â€
â€œAs if Iâ€™d take orders from my food,â€ said the spider. â€œJust wait until I get free! Iâ€™ll liquefy your organs and drink them like soup!â€
â€œWe can free you right now if you cooperate,â€ said Gatril. 
The jâ€™bafofi for the first time took a keen interest in Gatril. â€œA drake taking the orders of a human. Did he cast a spell on you?â€
â€œNo, I didnâ€™t,â€ said Kiran. â€œShe can leave or kill me whenever she wants. She just knows the kind of person I am and trusts me.â€
The jâ€™bafofi looked at the bosdrake quizzically, then chuckled. â€œThis is a very strange thing indeed. I hear your words human, but I still donâ€™t trust you. What do you want with me?â€
â€œI told you before,â€ said Kiran. â€œI just want your queex. Once I get that, Iâ€™ll leave you alone. So long as you promise not to eat anymore humans or beasts.â€
â€œFerrans,â€ she said. 
â€œWhat?â€ Kiran said.
â€œWe are ferrans,â€ said the jâ€™bafofi. â€œWe who are not human, but part human and part beast, are not simple-minded creatures. A monster is a mindless force of destruction, and beasts are just smart enough to be a humanâ€™s pet. Ferran are those on the same level of intelligence and social development as humans.â€
Kiran turned to Gatril, confused and dumbfounded. Gatril herself seemed puzzled too, but she had a knowing air about her.
â€œHave you heard of this before?â€ said Kiran. Gatril turned her eyes away, but Kiran had already seen the thoughtful, knowing look in them. â€œWhat is it, Gatril?â€
â€œYouâ€™re young, Kiran, so you wouldnâ€™t know,â€ said Gatril. â€œSome beasts have started to form their own communities, even cities. Those in those places are starting a movement to organize the beasts into their own identity. Ferran comes from the word feral and human; meaning one as powerful as humans, yet untamed by humans.â€
â€œR-Really?â€ said Kiran. The boy snatched up his bestiary and skipped through the pages. â€œI know they form clans but nothing as big as that!â€
â€œThatâ€™s why I said not to trust books written by just humans,â€ said Gatril. â€œHumans have a tendency to permit only whatâ€™s beneficial to them to exist. You, spider, what is your name?â€
â€œShirksire,â€ she said. 
Gatril said, â€œAre you from one of these ferran cities, Shirksire?â€
â€œYes,â€ Shirksire said. â€œA long time ago I was exiled because of my belief that humans will never see me as equal. When I found this cave the town soon learned I was hear and tried to kill me. I defended myselfâ€”â€
Kiran slapped the book shut, startling both women. Kiran put it down and looked at Shirksire testily. â€œThat doesnâ€™t give you the right to kill the entire town.â€
â€œDonâ€™t lecture me on morals, human!â€ Shirksire barked. â€œHow many ferrans have you killed and skinned, beheaded and boiled down to the bone just to keep as your trophies? I only killed those who entered my cave to kill me. Their weapons are over there in the corner. The males caught wind of me here and did the rest. Besidesâ€¦I doubt the entire town died. Probably some humans escaped. If the two of you can get past those idiot males, then thereâ€™s a good chance they did.â€
Gatril turned to Kiran to see what his response would be. She didnâ€™t want to tell him she mostly agreed with Shirksire; that she didnâ€™t see anything wrong with killing and eating humans who came after them. But her interactions with Kiran and previous humans couldnâ€™t fully make her accept the mindless killing of humans without reason.
However, her answer from Kiran was an unexpected one. He got up, took out his knife and began cutting the webs at Shirksireâ€™s feet.
â€œWhat are you doing?â€ said Gatril, getting up with the gun in her hands.
â€œShowing her forgiveness,â€ said Kiran as he finished removing the webs from around Shirksireâ€™s feet. â€œShe doesnâ€™t trust humans. But Iâ€™ll show her trustâ€”Shirksire.â€
The jâ€™bafofi sat patiently while Kiran cut away her restraints. But she still didnâ€™t move, courtesy of the gun aimed at her. When Kiran was finished, he went to Gatril and gestured for her to lower the gun.
â€œAre you sure about this Kiran?â€ Gatril said.
â€œâ€¦I havenâ€™t been wrong yet,â€ said Kiran. He turned to Shirksire. â€œIf you donâ€™t trust me, you should at least trust another ferranâ€¦â€
Shirksire waited on Gatril, and finally the bosdrake pointed the gun away from the jâ€™bafofi. Shirksire slowly stood, flexing the stiffness out of her limbs. She looked down at the pair and said, â€œYou are foolish for thinking you can make friends out of all your enemies, boy.â€
â€œAre you my enemy?â€ said Kiran.
Shirksire sighed. â€œFineâ€¦You win, human.â€
Kiran smiled. â€œIn that caseâ€¦â€ He quickly pulled down his trouser and underwear and began stroking his penis. â€œLetâ€™s get startedâ€¦â€
Shirksire flinched and backed away. â€œS-So soon?â€
â€œWhat?â€ said Gatril. â€œYouâ€™ve never seen a penis before?â€
Shirksire saw the quickly increasing size of Kiranâ€™s cock and grew uneasy. â€œThe malesâ€¦they do not have one soâ€¦thickâ€¦â€
Kiran chuckled. â€œDonâ€™t worry, it wonâ€™t do you anything much.â€ Now Kiran was fully erect and bobbing with the pulsing blood flow.
Still uneasy, Shirksire said, â€œHow would we beginâ€¦?â€
â€œOn your knees and suck it,â€ said Gatril. 
â€œY-You meanâ€¦in my mouth?â€ said Shirksire.
â€œOf course.â€ Gatril approached Shirksire and yanked on one of her arms. â€œThe sooner you do it, the quicker youâ€™ll get use to it. Now come on. This is great trust building.â€
Shirksire reluctantly stooped, now eye-level with Kiran. She took his warm member and gently stroked it. â€œI swear, human. If you ever double-cross me Iâ€™ll eat you alive.â€
â€œYouâ€™re about to do it anyways,â€ said Kiran.
Shirksire understood the joke too clearly and bit her lip in embarrassment. â€œDamn humanâ€¦â€
Shirksireâ€™s mandibles pulled apart and she brought her mouth towards Kiranâ€™s penis. She stuck her tongue out and brushed it against the tip. She licked it and made a funny face that Kiran smiled at. Then Gatril suddenly shoved her by the back of the head and all of Kiran entered her. 
Shirksire chocked and grabbed Kiran.
â€œCome no now!â€ said Gatril, repeatedly shoving her head onto the young manâ€™s rod. â€œFlick your tongue around it and swallow.â€
Shirksire did as she was told. Kiran winced and moaned as Shirksireâ€™s tongue startled to get the better of him. Gatril let go of Shirksireâ€™s head, and the she-spider started steadily sucking Kiran, closing her eyes as she got into her rhythm and stuck with it.
Gatril decided to play her part, and got behind the jâ€™bafofi and reached over her thigh for Shirksireâ€™d already slick vagina. As Gatril rubbed her swollen clitoris she began to moan with Kiran, her other hands gripping her thigh as Kiran tightened his hand on her hair.
Once Gatril felt her fingers becoming sufficiently most she brought around the bowl beneath Shirksire. She started dripping inside it. Gatril removed her hand and tasted it. â€œHmmmâ€¦â€
â€œBring it hereâ€¦â€ said Kiran, his face contorting with pleasure.
Gatril got up and put her hand to Kiranâ€™s mouth. He sucked her fingers and met a tangy taste of something like a sour fruit and raw meat. Kiran leaned into Gatril with a kiss, and slid his finger inside her crotchâ€”abruptly gripped Shirksireâ€™s head, stiffened and tipped on his toes. â€œOoooooh!â€
Kiran exploded inside Shirksireâ€™s mouth. The jâ€™bafofi pulled away and gagged. She cupped her hand under her chin and opened her mouth to let his semen slide off her tongue and into her palm.
Kiran sighed loudly and staggered back into Gatrilâ€™s embrace. â€œOh manâ€¦â€
Shirksire flicked her hand and flung the semen on the floor. She turned to Kiran, wiping her mouth. â€œYou couldâ€™ve told me you were going to do that.â€
â€œSorry,â€ said Kiran. â€œI got lost in the moment You were really good for your first timeâ€¦â€
â€œIâ€™m a quick learner,â€ said Shirksire. She took up the wait bowl from beneath her and looked in it. â€œBut I havenâ€™t reached my orgasm yet.â€
â€œOh, donâ€™t worry,â€ said Kiran, holding his still sturdy penis. â€œI still have a round left inside me.â€
Surprised, Shirksire stood up. â€œAgain? Already?â€
Gatril said, â€œThatâ€™s how we do it. Now get on your hands and knees. I want to try a position I always thought about.â€
â€œPlease,â€ Shirksire said, â€œnothing drastic.â€ She leaned over, and Gatril carefully climbed onto her back. â€œW-Whatâ€”â€
â€œI see,â€ said Kiran. He positioned himself behind Shirksire, his hip in line with her bottom, his face with Gatrilâ€™s. Kiran caressed Gatrilâ€™s vagina with his tongue while slowly thrusting his penis inside Shirksire.
Shirksireâ€™s body tense and she moaned, feeling every inch of Kiranâ€™s member press against her walls. Gatril bit her lips and gyrated her bottom in Kiranâ€™s face while he slowly thrusted in and out of Shirksire.
Kiran started slow as usual, making sure to savor the taste of Gatril and the feeling inside Shirksire. Both womenâ€™s moans filled the cave, and got increasingly louder as Kiran picked up the pace. Kiranâ€™s tongue moved friskily now, making Gatril wiggle and tense spasmodically. His thrusting hips slapped his testicles against Shirksire and she became more tender, arching her back. 
Kiran squeezed Gatrilâ€™s bottom for support as his mouth dug into her, until she yelled and sprayed her fluids into his mouth. Kiran hung onto her and lapped up everything, while Shirksire succumbed to the relentless pounding inside her and reached her own climax. A very loud, wet and warm one.
Kiran finished up with another load of semen that stung the Shirksireâ€™s cervix.
â€œOuch!â€ was her response.
Finally drained, Kiran fell on his back. Shirksire collapsed and Gatril rolled off her. All three individuals were on the floor, and one by one they all fell asleep.

When they woke up Kiran quickly made the spell, with Shirksire seated before him and looking intently.
â€œSo you can only use queex?â€ said Shirksire.
â€œNo,â€ Kiran said as he mixed the contents in the bowl. â€œBut in my case it makes for a unique spell, plus I also want the battle experience.â€
â€œâ€¦I see,â€ Shirksire said. â€œAre you sure you are not a sexplorer?â€
Kiran laughed. â€œDonâ€™t get me wrong, I love sex, but not as much as I love magic.â€ Kiran finished making a white orb with grey ripples. He tossed between his hands, waiting for it to dry. â€œHowever, I still feel a little urge to have intercourse with beaâ€¦ferrans. They have such different flavors.â€
â€œAre you his girlfriend, bosdrake?â€ Shirksire said.
â€œFriend with benefits,â€ Gatril replied. â€œYou can join the group too, if you want.â€
Shirksire pontificated on the offer, tapping her index finger from three of her hands. â€œI would love to have someone teach me magic, but Iâ€¦â€
Kiran was putting the orb into the fifth and final socket when he looked up at Shirksireâ€™s troubled expression. â€œWhat is it?â€
Shirksire said, â€œI feel much safe in this cave than outside.â€
â€œTrust me,â€ said Gatril, â€œsomeone like you wouldnâ€™t have much to fear. You just need to mark out your own territory. You can even stay with me if you wan to.â€
â€œReallyâ€¦?â€ Shirksire said, half rising from her seat. 
â€œOf course,â€ said Gatril. â€œIâ€™m close to where Kiran lives. He can always visit us.â€
Then Shirksireâ€™s elation dwindled when she realized something. â€œâ€¦But my booksâ€¦There are a lot of them.â€
â€œIf youâ€™ve ready read them, then you donâ€™t need them anymore,â€ said Kiran. â€œIf you were trying to learn magic, they obviously werenâ€™t helpful.â€
Shirksire smiled. â€œYour offer does sound tempting. I must considerate, though.â€
â€œNo problem,â€ said Kiran, getting up. â€œNow letâ€™s see if this worksâ€¦â€
Kiran channeled his spirit energy into the staff and pointed to the gun next to Gatril. A thick strand of silk spewed from the orb and attached to the weapon, and Karin yanked it towards him and caught it.
â€œA webâ€¦â€ Shirksire remarked.
â€œJust in case I canâ€™t reach something from where I am,â€ said Kiran. â€œSo, shall we all leave? This cave is getting a bit cramped now.â€
Shirksire got up. â€œRight this wayâ€¦â€
Shirksire lead them to out of the cave into the ruins of the town, where the male spiders awaiting them, peering from atop the buildings and inside through the windows. However, any thoughts of making an attack on the human and bosdrake where stalled by the presence of their female.
â€œWhat will you do about them?â€ said Gatril as she walked by the arachnids.
â€œIâ€™ll still keep them around as a deterrent from travelers,â€ Shirksire said, watching Kiran hurry towards his quacycle and check for any damages. 
The sun was setting in the distance, and long shadows were strewn from the trees across the ground. The air was cool, and Kiran felt relaxed now that his entire mission was complete. When they were out on the highway, Kiran and Gatril faced Shirksire, about to say their final goodbyes.
â€œWhen will you be back?â€ said Shirksire.
â€œWithin a monthâ€™s time, after the tournament is finished,â€ said Kiran. â€œIf I get my sorcererâ€™s license, I can keep beastsâ€¦or ferrans as my pets. In this case, you would be my partner. It means you could walk amongst humanâ€™s freely without any persecution. Then we can study new magic together.â€
Shirksire smiled. â€œI like the sound of that.â€ She knelt over Kiran, held his cheeks and kissed him on his forehead. â€œIâ€™ll be seeing you, Kiranâ€¦â€
â€œYou too, Shirksire,â€ said the young man.
â€œWe should get going,â€ said Gatril. â€œbultungins usually get active at night. And we already pissed off a gang of them.â€
Kiran and Gatril got on the quacycle and rode off, while Shirksire walked back to the town. 
â€œWell,â€ said Gatril, â€œyouâ€™ve acquired all your spells, young sorcerer. I guess you only need to prepare for your grand debut at the tournament.â€
Kiran said, â€œYeah, but thatâ€™s only the first part. After that Iâ€™ll need to raise money doing a lot of missions. I still remember my promise to carry you to Puzzland. And I want to discover different magical artifacts on the uncharted continents.â€
Gatrilâ€™s arms slinked around Kiran affectionately. â€œDo you think we can say we are boyfriend and girlfriend now?â€
â€œThatâ€™s if you mind sharing,â€ said Kiran. â€œThe uncharted worlds are really dangerous, so Iâ€™ll need as much support as I can get. I think I really will each Shirksire how to use magic. Heck, maybe all the other girls can join me.â€
â€œSo long as you eat my crotch the most, I donâ€™t mind,â€ said Gatril.
Kiran looked over his shoulder at Gatril, and said, â€œDonâ€™t worry, youâ€™ll always be my main girl.â€
Gatrilâ€™s mouth was slightly ajar, and she closed it. She smiled at Kiran and kissed his cheek. 
Kiran turned his attention back to the road, grinning. Have I got a story for you, grandpa.

INTRODUCTION

Like many people I thought I could abuse my body by eating what I wanted, when I wanted and as much as I wanted. It is amazing how you can be so busy with life that you let life pass you by. At one point I woke up and realized I weighed in at 335 pounds, so I dieted and exercised my way to 225 pounds. A few years later I found myself back up to 365 pounds. I again started exercising semi-regularly, cut out sodas and started eating healthier, but not healthy. I dropped 80 pounds over the course of around a year. Then I had a stroke.

Talk about a life-changing wake-up call. The stroke affected my right side â€“ speech, chewing, bowels, loss of right arm and leg function, and many inner body functions. I felt like my life was nothing more than surviving day to day, sleeping and eating. Using the restroom, if I could make it in time, was like potty training all over again. I could only sit for a short time before needing to lie down and could not fix my own meals or even get a glass of water. Sleeping more than an hour at a time was a great blessing. As stubborn as I am, I tried to push myself. Some things leave you helpless. No matter how much you try it is out of your control. The simple fact is I had lost my strength, much of my movement and essentially my freedom and independence.

Two years have gone by since the stroke occurred. I thank God for what I can do. Iâ€™ve come a long way, but have further to go to make a full recovery.

When I was in the hospital I was informed that I was diabetic, had high cholesterol and high blood pressure (208/120). They immediately put me on medication and quickly told me what I should and shouldnâ€™t eat. Interestingly, the meals they fed me didnâ€™t match their advice. After 5 days at the hospital, losing more abilities than when I arrived, they finally released me over threats I would simply check myself out. My first visit with a doctor outside the hospital, while writing slip after slip of prescription drugs, the doctor asked how I felt having to take medications the rest of my life.

Shocked, I asked what he meant. He basically replied that it was unlikely I would ever totally control my high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and that diabetes would be with me for the rest of my life. I told him that he better get ready to start reducing my prescription medications, because I wouldnâ€™t be on them forever. I knew it was possible to overcome any adversity. Eating properly and exercising to the best of my limited ability, I began to show him that I was serious. I admit it was very slow going.

Ten months later I had the opportunity to participate in a stroke study at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with the Physical Therapy masters students. With their help, I was eating well and walking 40 minutes twice a day. My bad cholesterol became a thing of the past, but the high blood pressure and diabetes still plagued me and my good cholesterol was too low.

Nobody I knew in medicine had an answer. My college degree is in Sports Medicine. I was pre-med at one time and studied molecular biology, physiology and other medical courses. I aced through the classes. But I didnâ€™t know the answer and none of my professors or doctors had an answer. I spent a good nine months spending much of my time looking at studies, research, medical information and my blood test results. I hadnâ€™t lost an ounce in over a year, even with exercise and a reduced calorie diet. That should have done it. I was just tired of the answer that the stroke had affected minor systems in my body that were preventing me from full recovery and weight loss.

I came across a book that said I could cure my diabetes. I saved up, bought it, reviewed it, researched every study mentioned, studied more and then finally tried a version of it that I could live with. Within 1Â½ months of trying my cure for diabetes program my good cholesterol had risen, my blood pressure was normal at 120/70 (thatâ€™s less than my best physical peak when I was young) and I did not need any medicine for diabetes. I gained about 15 pounds when I first started the diet, and then dropped weight for a net loss of 10 pounds â€“ I gained muscle and bone density and flushed away fat. The doctor couldnâ€™t believe it.

I recommend following this program for 90 days and then making a lifetime commitment to eating healthy. I actually stopped after I didnâ€™t need any more medication. I havenâ€™t gained any weight, but I havenâ€™t lost any either, and my blood work continues to show I am healthy. Since starting to write this book to share with all the people asking me what I did, I have started strictly following my own advice again and dropped 5 pounds the first week. Maybe this is the true weight loss answer weâ€™ve all been looking forward to finding.

This book has been written for all those people who have been asking me for information on how I accomplished curing my diseases so quickly. That statement kind of bothers me. I did not heal myself. God gave me a body that was wondrously and fearfully made that was able to heal because I followed the rules He originally set forth for healthy bodies. You can follow some simple steps I have tried to set out here so that your body can heal according to the marvelous work God performed in making you.

I have written background information on pH balances, nutrition, oxygen, water, etc to give you the reasons for what I did and why you should do something similar. I have included charts and tables in the back to help also. I hope the information is written so it is easily understood and helps you. I have experienced the affects firsthand and know it works.

HEALTH CARE EPIDEMIC

As of April 2, 2009, the leading causes of death annually in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control are as follows;

Heart disease: 652,091

Cancer: 559,312

Stroke: 143,579

Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 130,933

Accidents (unintentional injuries): 117,809

Diabetes: 75,119

That is 1,561,034 people last year who died from mostly preventable diseases. That is over 13 times the number of people who die in accidents. It doesnâ€™t include the number of us who have suffered a heart attack or stroke and lived, or who are fighting cancer, respiratory diseases or diabetes.

Below is the number of estimated new cases of these diseases in 2008 in the U.S. alone:

Heart disease: 650,000 new occurrences + 450,000 reoccurrences of heart attacks

Cancer: 1,437,000 newly diagnosed patients

It is estimated there are over 11 million people currently fighting cancer

Stroke: 700,000 new occurrences + 100,000 reoccurrences

It is estimated over 4.6 million people have had a stroke â€“ 30% left with disabilities

Chronic lower respiratory diseases: no information for newly diagnosed cases It is estimated over 16 million people have chronic lower respiratory diseases

Diabetes: 798,000 newly diagnosed patients

It is estimated there are over 16 million people have diabetes

The American Medical Association relies on pharmaceutical medicine to treat the symptoms of these diseases despite the fact that these diseases can be eliminated by proper changes in diet and lifestyle. Even the New England Journal of Medicine, a very prestigious medical publication, acknowledges that diet and exercise can completely eliminate many diseases. Yet doctors are still taught to treat symptoms with drugs rather than trying to cure the disease.

When I went to my doctor to find out what I could do to reverse my diabetes I was told that it was a lifetime condition and could not be reversed. Even the American Diabetes Association admits diabetes can be reversed. I think doctors are good overall and care about their patients. They are simply misinformed on many diseases. Doctors have good intentions, but the pharmaceutical industry will lose money if people are actually healed. Diabetes is big business that generates multi-billions of dollars in the US alone. Not to mention the monies brought in annually for heart disease, cancer and other preventable, treatable diseases. It is in the best interests of the drug companies keeping people as lifetime customers.

The drugs and insulin prescribed by your medical practitioners do nothing to promote healing. They simply treat symptoms. If anything they screw up the balance of our bodies and strain an already strained system. My high blood pressure was lowered to normal readings, my cholesterol to healthy levels and my diabetes was reversed. I donâ€™t take any drugs for these or any other condition.

This book is written to share what I have learned after much research, reading and asking questions of others who have reversed their diseases. I know of individuals who were cured of their cancer by making basic changes that anyone can do. Many are the same things presented here that I used. It takes a little effort, mostly to change a few bad habits and add new ones. It can be accomplished by anyone.

pH

pH (potential of Hydrogen) is the measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution â€“ for purposes of this discussion I refer to the pH levels of our blood and cellular fluids. pH is measured on a scale of 0 to 14. The lower the number the more acidic our body fluids and the higher the number the more alkaline we are. A pH of 7.0 is neutral â€“ neither acid or alkaline

As an example, letâ€™s look at a cola. It has a pH of about 2.0 â€“ that is very acidic. Many school students have probably performed the test in class where they dropped a nail in a can of Coke. The nail is usually totally dissolved within 3 days. Cola is also useful in cleaning stubborn stains & grease on clothes and in removing hard to clean toilet and sink stains. If the acid in soda eats through a metal nail, imagine what it does to your body!

Our bodies are naturally slightly alkaline, with 7.3 to 7.5 being the optimum alkalinity for healthy body functions. The pancreas regulates the pH balance in our bodies. This is the same organ which regulates insulin production. The pancreas pulls potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium from our blood stream to balance pH when foods are digested. It requires almost 750,000 times the effort to convert soda at an acid pH of 2.0 to an alkaline pH of 7.5 than it does to convert a fruit or vegetable when digested from a pH of 7.0 to an alkaline pH of 7.5. [Converting pH is exponential: to convert pH 2.0 to pH 3.0 takes a measure of 10. To convert it to the next level of pH 4.0 it takes a measure of 100 (10 x 10). To the next pH of 5.0 it takes a measure of 1,000 (10 x 10 x 10).]

If we do not have enough of the essential minerals - potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium â€“ in our bloodstream from the foods and supplements we eat, the pancreas will begin pulling these minerals from our vital organs, tissues and bones to neutralize the acid and safely process it from through body. This can lead to severe and prolonged damage to the pancreas, bones and muscle if we consume mainly acidic foods. In the back of the book is a chart of alkalizing and acidifying foods. Take a look at how many acidic foods you regularly consume. Can you see how by eating sugars, refined foods, excessive amounts of meat, chips, drinking coffee and soda, etc. we have been taxing our pancreas to try to keep an alkaline balance? Eventually the pancreas canâ€™t keep up and we have an acidic build-up of fluid in our bodies. This leads to all kinds of medical conditions as the acid eats at our organs and tissues.

Mild acidosis can cause such problems as:

â€¢ Cardiovascular damage and hypertension
