
lived in open window barracks. At each camp the incidence of acute respiratory disease

was at least 45% higher in the energy-efficient barracks.

Air conditioning units just take the impure positively charged air from the room, cool it

down, add a very smal amount of outside air with it and re-circulate this impure positively

charged, germ-laden air right back into the room again. And people wonder why they don't

feel good after being inside al day long! Our forefathers didn't have air conditioners;

instead they had large ceilings with tal windows that opened from top and bottom, and

ceiling fans to help keep them cool in the summer.

NATURAL WAY TO PURIFY AIR

One natural way to help purify the air in your home or office is to

have plenty of live plants, for they take the carbon dioxide we exhale

and convert it into oxygen. One plant wil remove up to 87% of al toxins

in 100 square feet of living area every 24 hours. So, if your home or

office is 2000 sq. ft. in size you would need 20 plants placed throughout

your home or office.





IMPROPER BREATHING

Mil ions of people suffer from a wide variety of ailments that are partly caused by an

insufficient supply of oxygen. The problem is that most people do not breathe correctly.

Many people are shal ow breathers, only fil ing the top portion of their lungs. When we

completely fil our lungs with air the bottom portion of the lungs wil push the diaphragm

down, and this action wil push the stomach out. If your stomach doesn't come out as you

breathe, then you are not breathing correctly.

Exercise stimulates you to breathe faster and deeper. Your diaphragm, a dome-

shaped sheet of muscle fibers dividing your chest from your abdomen, contracts with each

breath and pul s downward. This in turn creates a vacuum in your chest cavity that sucks

air into your lungs. Then when your diaphragm muscles relax and rise, the air is pushed

out. This forces open mil ions of air cel s that you do not use in sedentary living. Vigorous

breathing not only brings in the needed oxygen for your blood-stream to carry to the

tissues, but it also strengthens and protects your organs against disease and keeps them

fit for action. The great advantage of abundance of lung exercise is seen in the fact that

professional singers suffer less from lung infections than others.





FRESH AIR AND CHEERFULNESS

One of the benefits that children and adults receive from being much in

the open air is cheerfulness. It has been shown that positively charged air, (the

bad kind) causes an overproduction of a stress hormone cal ed serotonin in

mammals. This hormone is associated with sudden changes in

mood. So, when our children get in a bad mood and are cross or

whiny, take them outdoors to run and play where they can get some

generous doses of negatively charged pure fresh air, to counteract their

stress.





OXYGEN KILLS CANCER CELLS

Cancer cel s cannot live in the presence of negatively charged oxygen. When

exposed to oxygen they die. (3) That tel s me that we need to learn to breathe deeply of

pure fresh country air. We know that oxygen makes up 21% of the earth's atmosphere, yet

researchers have found that the levels have dropped to less than 15% over some

metropolitan areas.

WOUNDS HEAL FASTER

It is a wel -known fact that wounds exposed to sunshine and fresh air heal more

rapidly than when bandaged. In fact, no wound wil heal without air. In order, then, for

wounds to heal quickly, it is most important that they be exposed to a constant supply of

pure fresh air.





THE BEST PLACE TO LIVE

Pol utants in the air! Everyone is worried about what modern

technology is doing to us. This is especial y true in cities, where car

exhausts, industries and waste disposal facilities spew pol utants into

the air. So the best place to live is in the

country where the air is purer. What kind of

country home is best to live in? A home of

frame construction is preferable to a block

home which tends to be damp and cold. Do not rent or purchase

a home that does not have plenty of windows with cross

ventilation. Shade trees and shrubbery too close and dense

around a house are unhealthful, for they prevent a free circulation of air. Make sure the

home is not in any kind of low concavity. Watch out for homes in hol owed out places, for

they tend to be drained ground; this wil help prevent the danger of disease due to

dampness from low-lying, il -drained land.





IN CONCLUSION

One of the finest statements I have found written on the importance of air are these

words penned by an outstanding health educator: "In order to have good blood we must

breathe wel - ful , deep inspirations of pure air, which fil the lungs with oxygen and purify

the blood. They impart to it a bright color and send it, a life-giving current, to every part of

the body. A good respiration soothes the nerves; it stimulates the appetite and renders

digestion more perfect; and it induces sound refreshing sleep. If an insufficient supply of

oxygen is received, the blood moves sluggishly, the waste, poisonous matter which should

be thrown off in the exhalations from the lungs is retained, and the blood becomes impure.

Not only the lungs, but the stomach, liver, and brain are affected. The skin becomes

shal ow; digestion is retarded; the heart is depressed; the brain is clouded; the thoughts

are confused; gloom settles upon the spirits; the whole system becomes depressed and

inactive, and peculiarly susceptible to disease." (3)

As you can readily see, the health of the whole body depends in part upon the

healthy action of the respiratory organs and the kind of air we breathe. Man can live

weeks without food, days without water, but only minutes without air

PURE WATER





This chapter wil cover three major aspects of water: What is pure soft water? How much

water should one drink? How do you use water external y (hydrotherapy) to heal the

body?



WHAT IS PURE SOFT WATER?

With the exception of pure air, there is no other element of nature that is as

important in sustaining life as pure soft water. The chemical composition of pure soft water

is represented by the chemical formula H20, which means that it is composed of two parts

hydrogen and one part oxygen. Both are odorless, colorless, tasteless and transparent.

Where can one find pure soft water today in our chemicalized society? Municipal

water supplies have been found to contain over 700 different chemicals, yet federal laws

require testing for only 16 of these. Recent research now indicates that chlorine, which is

used by municipal water supplies to kil bacteria, is much more dangerous to human

health than was original y assumed. It has been shown to be a significant contributing

factor in certain types of cancer and heart disease.

In 1987, a major study by the National Cancer Institute concluded that the risk of

developing bladder cancer rose with increased intake of beverages made with chlorinated

surface water - which is what comes out of the tap in about half the households in the U.

S. (1) Bladder cancer primarily affects the elderly and is the fifth most common cause of

cancer in the U. S. The incidence of bladder cancer increased by more than 50% since

1950.. True, properly chlorinated water kil s most germs and viruses, but it also kil s many

cel s in our bodies. If you drink chlorinated water it is best to let the water sit a few

minutes after getting it from the faucet, as chlorine evaporates from the water once it is

exposed to the air.

DONÂ¨T DRINK WATER CONTAINING FLUORIDE, CHEMICALS, METALS

AND PESTICIDES

Fluoride is derived from fluorine, a deadly chemical to humans, and, while not dangerous

in smal amounts, as it accumulates in the human body, it can eventual y cause cancer

and/or other il nesses which can be fatal. Toothpaste is the second largest source of

fluorine, next to water which is number one. Fluorides attack almost everything. Their

chemical action is such that al containers must be lined with rubber or plastic, for they eat

through al metal material. What must it do to the tissues of the body?

"In recent years, public health professionals have become

increasingly concerned over the presence of toxic chemicals in our

drinking water, particularly heavy metals, chemicals, and pesticides.

These substances are extremely difficult to remove once they get into

the water supply.â€(2) Eight out of ten Americans live near a toxic waste

dump or source, according to the Council of Economic Priorities. These toxic sites can

and do contaminate ground water.(3) One pol utant, TCE (commonly used for degreasing

metals) has been appearing in the most unexpected places. Half the water supply of

Silicon Val ey, California is contaminated by it. This has stopped people from using

drinking fountains in Amana, Iowa, and New Brighton, Minnesota. In Green Bay,

Wisconsin, residents have requested emergency wel s. The Environmental Protection

Agency (EPA) reported that TCE has turned up in significant amounts in one out of ten

major ground water systems.

Forty-two mil ion people - one out of every five Americans served by public water

systems - consume dangerous amounts of lead in their household drinking water. (3)

Can a person tel good water from bad water by tasting it? Many chemicals and toxic

substances are odorless and tasteless. There is no way you could taste them. Your water

could be loaded with toxic levels of lead and you would never know it. You can't taste

lead. You can't see lead. Also, it is best not to drink water from plastic bottles as the

chemical in the plastic leaches into the water. This is why much of the distil ed water you

buy in the store in plastic bottles tastes bad.

A warning about tap water - Most people think their city is responsible for giving

them safe tap water. This is not so. A federal court has decreed that a city cannot be held

responsible for the purity and quality of its drinking water. . At least 4,200 cases of bladder

cancer and 6,500 cases of rectal cancer in the United States each year may be a direct

result of drinking chlorinated water. Robert Morris, at the Medical Col ege of Wisconsin,

reached this conclusion after evaluating 10 separate studies on the connection between

cancer and chlorinated water consumption, (American Journal of Public Health, July,

1992). We obviously need to look to another source for our drinking water, since only half

of one percent of our household water is used for drinking and cooking. What about

bottled water? A New York survey found traces of carbon tetrachloride, and other solvents

in 48 of 93 bottled waters sampled in 1987. Bottled water is less regulated than tap water.

So where do we get pure soft water?





21





DISTILLED WATER IS PURE SOFT WATER

Distil ed water is water which has been heated and turned into vapor, so that

virtual y al its impurities are left behind, since they are incapable of

turning into a vapor. Then the water vapors are cooled down leaving

you distil ed water. Distil ed water has no taste, color, odor, bacteria,

heavy metals, acids, inorganic minerals, toxic chemicals, poisons,

etc. Rain water is also distil ed water, but it becomes pol uted as it

fal s through the sky; so distil ed water is the purest water available.

A simple experiment to try at home is to boil a pan of tap water. Let it

boil until al the water has turned to vapor. What is left in the bottom

of the pan? White chalky mineral deposits. The harder the water, the more minerals it wil

contain; and the fewer the minerals the softer the water. Distil ed water has no minerals,

so it is the softest water possible. The only other kind of filter unit which is good as a

distil er and provides pure soft water and is more economical to operate then a distil er is a

Reverse Osmosis filter unit.



INORGANIC MINERALS, ARE HARMFUL TO THE HUMAN BODY

Regular water consists of inorganic minerals which cannot be assimilated by the

body. The only minerals the body can utilize are organic minerals. Al the inorganic

minerals must be eliminated or they wil in time cause health problems. There is a big

difference between powdered iron filings (inorganic iron) and the iron found in plants

(organic iron). Inorganic minerals are excel ent for the plants which take them and convert

them into organic minerals that our bodies can use. Plants also take the water that is used

to grow our fruits and vegetables and convert it into distil ed water. For example, a fresh

apple consists of 83% distil ed water. When we consume hard water saturated with

calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, silicon, etc., we do not realize that the body is unable

to assimilate these inorganic minerals. These solids or mineral deposits are deposited in

the joints as arthritis, in the intestinal wal s causing constipation, and along the arteries

causing them to harden. The kidneys rol up the mineral deposits into little stones, cal ed

kidney stones until they get too large for the ducts. Calcium deposits in the heart

chambers and valves can become so cemented with mineral deposits that heart surgery

becomes necessary. Calcium deposits in the inner ear cause deafness. Skil ed surgeons

can now remove these deposits and in many cases restore hearing again. Mineral

deposits often coat the crystal ine lens of the eyes with a fine film possibly resulting in

cataracts. (5)



DISTILLED WATER OR REVERSE OSMOSIS WATER HELPS RESTORE

HEALTH

You may have heard that distil ed water leaches good minerals from the body. This

is not so. The only minerals that are leached by distil ed water are the inorganic minerals

that the body cannot use. Distil ed water wil not leach organic minerals that have become

part of the structure of the cel system. Once an organic mineral has become part of the

cel structure, it cannot be leached. As distil ed water enters the body, since it is so pure, it

begins to pick up inorganic mineral deposits that have accumulated in the joints, artery

wal s, or wherever such deposits occur, and begins to carry them out. Gal stones and

kidney stones get smal er and smal er until they pass through the ducts. Little by little

arthritic pains become less as joints become more supple and movable. Arteries gradual y

become more elastic and blood pressure tends to become more normal as the inorganic



22





minerals are removed from the body. I have personal y seen many of my clients, who

switched to distil ed water or reverse osmosis water and modified their diets, total y

recover from many of these health problems.

Note: For those who can afford it, I strongly encourage you to buy a good quality

water distil er or a reverse osmosis filtering system. As for bottled water, I have tested

many types of bottled water and distil ed is purest with Reverse Osmosis running a close

second. The major drawback for both of these is that they come in plastic bottles and the

chemicals in the plastic leach into the water. This is why much of the distil ed water you

buy in the store tastes so bad. Glass jars are best. So, if you can't afford a distil er, take

your empty glass jars to the Reverse Osmosis machines that you now see in front of many

grocery stores and fil them with Reverse Osmosis water.



HOW MUCH WATER SHOULD ONE DRINK?

It is general y recommended that a sedentary person drink a minimum of eight, 8

oz. glasses of water a day, which would be two quarts. If you are

overweight, then you need more, a smal child

would need less. There is a simple formula one

can use to know how much water they need.

Take your weight divide it into half and that is how

many ounces of water you need. Of course, if

you are working out in the hot sun and sweating

profusely you would need considerably more. One simple test to know if you are drinking

enough water is that if your urine is pale with very little odor you are getting enough water.

If your urine is dark with a bad odor, you need to drink more water. The only exception to

this would be someone who is taking medicine which wil often color the urine. Many

people do not like water; they would rather drink coffee, tea, cocoa, soft drinks, alcohol,

etc. which are harmful to the body. These things should be eliminated; they are not

natural. If the good Lord wanted us to drink these He would rain them from the sky. Pure

soft water is the very best liquid for our body; there is nothing better. Water is the principal

chemical constituent of the human body, comprising approximately 65% of the body

weight of an adult male, and 55% of the adult female. When we do not drink enough water

our blood thickens and flows with greater difficulty (causing blood pressure to rise). This

can cause trouble not only in your body tissues and organs, but also to your heart as it

must pump this thicker blood to al parts of the body.

Water is the most transient of any element taken into the body. It is eliminated four

ways: namely, lungs, skin, kidneys and intestines. Drinking adequate amounts of water

helps remove from the blood its foulest materials, rendering the blood cleaner for the

building up of tissues, and better health.



WE LOSE APPROXIMATELY THREE QUARTS OF WATER DAILY

Our bodies lose on the average of 3 quarts of water every day. Each

time we blink our eyes, we lose water. Every time we breathe our bodies

lose water. Blow on a mirror, and observe the moisture; this came from

your lungs. A sedentary person wil sweat approximately 2 glasses of water

a day. By drinking two quarts of water a day and getting the other quart

from the food we eat (an apple is 83% water), we wil be replacing the

water we lose each day. It would require 2500 gal ons of water a day (that's

40,000 glasses) to keep the body organs functioning properly, if the body

didn't have a unique method of conserving fluids. This is done by our kidneys which are a

marvelous filtering system. Our kidneys weigh between 4-6 oz. each, are about 4-1/2



23





inches long and 2-3 inches wide, and they process an amount of blood equivalent to al

that is in the human body (about five quarts) every four to five minutes. These smal filters

know exactly what substances to let pass by, and then they reabsorb the fluid after the

poisons are passed on to the bladder as urine. The kidneys excrete one to one-and-a-half

quarts of urine each day if the body is receiving enough water (8 or more glasses a day).



WHEN SHOULD WE DRINK WATER?

The very best time for drinking your water is to drink two or more glasses first thing

upon arising in the morning. We should never drink water with our meals as it wil dilute

the hydrochloric acid in the stomach. The diluted hydrochloric acid wil have a harder time

breaking down the food, causing the food to stay in the stomach

longer, and causing indigestion, ulcers, etc. We should wait at least

one hour after we eat before drinking water and no sooner than 15

minutes before we eat. It is also not advisable to drink real hot or real

cold water or liquids of any kind as these extremes are debilitating to

the stomach. Water is needed to help regulate our temperatures. Our

skin covers approximately 3,000 sq. inches and receives one third of

al the blood circulating in the body. The way it regulates our body heat

is by opening the blood vessels and also by cooling itself by the mil ions of sweat glands in

our skin. If you are working out in the hot sun al day long you can lose over two quarts of

water through the skin by perspiring.

Water is also a lubricant - preventing friction between the body's joints and

muscles. During manual labor, the body is stretched, twisted, and bent in ways that

wouldn't be possible if water wasn't present, such as in the fluid that surrounds the knee.





LACK OF WATER CAN CAUSE THESE HEALTH PROBLEMS

Our brain is approximately 90% water. When we do not drink enough water our

brain becomes dehydrated and we can get a headache. There have been patients

admitted to the hospital, who were so far off in their thinking that their family had thought

they had a nervous breakdown. Upon checking them over, their doctors

found them to be dehydrated. By simply giving them fluids (water and

salt mixture) their mental problems disappeared within a matter of

hours.

Our blood is 78% water and one of its functions is to carry away

the waste materials in the body. If a person doesn't drink enough water

the blood becomes thicker with a higher concentration of waste

materials in the blood stream, and as it circulates through the brain it

can cause headaches. It can also cause a burning sensation during the act of voiding as

the urine is very strong from the lack of water in the urinary tract. This strong

concentration of waste materials can also cause kidney stones and kidney and bladder

infections.

One of the most important things to remember about water is the effect upon your

heart and bloodstream from drinking insufficient water. Dehydration

thickens the blood and puts a strain on the circulatory system. This can

cause high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes. If you want a healthy

heart, drink plenty of water to keep your blood stream free flowing.

Constipation is another problem caused many times by a lack of



24

insufficient water. The fecal matter in the large colon should be moist and soft; but if you

are not drinking enough water the body wil reabsorb this impure water from the fecal

matter, making it hard and causing constipation and hemorrhoids. Lack of water can also

cause swel ing of the ankles, psoriasis of the skin, eye problems, fatigue, etc.

Most al of us are very conscious of our outward appearance to the extent that we

bathe regularly, wear clean clothes and smel nice, but what about the inside of our

bodies? Just as it takes water on the outside of our bodies to keep them clean, it is even

more important to use plenty of water on the inside to keep us clean. A person who has a

body ful of accumulated waste wil not have good health. So for optimum health drink a

sufficient amount of water everyday.



HOW DO WE USE WATER

EXTERNALLY (HYDROTHERAPY) TO

HEAL THE BODY?



DAILY BATHING FOR OPTIMUM HEALTH

The external application of water is one of the easiest and most satisfactory ways of

cleansing the body and regulating the circulation of the blood. A warm bath opens the

pores of the skin and helps in the elimination of impurities. Both warm and neutral baths

soothe the nerves and equalize the circulation. The skin has mil ions of pores from which

flow constantly a stream of poisons that are left on the skin. If the person doesn't bathe

often, these poisons wil continue to accumulate and cause many health problems. Note: If

the underclothes are not changed daily, the impurities that are on the clothes wil be

reabsorbed by the pores of the skin; thus they are taken back into the blood stream, and

these impurities put an extra load on the internal organs of elimination sometimes causing

infections and sickness.



COOL BATH OR SHOWER VERY STIMULATING

Most people would receive tremendous benefits from a cool or tepid bath or shower

every day. It wil improve one's circulation by bringing the blood to the surface. It is also

very invigorating to the body; and after you dry off, you feel terrific.



MOIST HEATING THROAT COMPRESS

A cold wet cotton cloth is placed around the neck, then covered very wel with a dry

flannel cloth to prevent air circulation. The body wil heat this wet cloth up and you have a

mild prolonged application of moist heat. The best time to do this is in the evening just

before you go to bed, leave it on al night, and remove it in the morning. The compress wil

be dry by then. As soon as you remove the compress, rub the neck with a cloth wrung out

of cold water. This compress is very good for sore throats, hoarseness, tonsilitis,

laryngitis, eustachian tube inflammation, etc. This compress can also be used on a

swol en knee, elbow, etc.



HOT AND COLD FOOT BATH

Simply fil two large containers. Fil one with hot water and the other with ice water.

Then immerse the feet first in the hot water for 3 minutes, then in the ice water for 1

minute. Do this three times in each and finish in the ice water. This alternate hot and cold

foot bath is very good for improving circulation to the feet, for helping to remove fluid

retention in the feet, for those with a cold or low grade fever, etc. The alternate hot and

cold wil increase the body's white blood cel count, which wil help build the body's



25

immune system, and improve your general health. This hot and cold bath can also be

done to the leg, hand, arm, etc.



TUB BATH TO LOWER FEVERS

If one has a fever of approximately 102 degrees F., then put them in a tub of water

with a temperature of about 98 degrees F., and this wil bring the fever down. Never put

them in a tub of real cold water as this wil drive the blood from the limbs of the body

toward the trunk of the body and wil cause congestion of the blood.

These are just a few of the simple natural ways to use water external y to improve

health. For more information on this subject, I highly recommend the book Home

Remedies, by Drs. Calvin and Agatha Thrash, published by New Lifestyle Books, Seale,

AL., 36875.

SUNSHINE, NATURE'S HEALER





Sunlight is one of nature's healing agents. It takes 8 minutes for the sun's rays to

reach the earth. Fifty-four percent of the light reaching the earth is invisible. Forty-nine

percent is infrared light and 4.6 percent ultraviolet. The visible light reaching the earth

accounts for 46 percent.



Invisible Ultra Violet Light

4.6 percent

Invisible Infared Light

49 percent

Visible Light

46 percent



Throughout most of recorded history man has lived and worked out of doors with

fÃ¼l exposure to sunlight. In our modern society today, mil ions live in the cities, working

indoors in factories and offices. We live in a glass environment, where the larger portion of

the day is spent behind window glass, which keeps out the ultraviolet light that is so

healing to the body. Fluorescent and incandescent light is used in our offices, schools,

and factories. This light source is entirely different from the kind that comes from natural

sunlight.



Ful , direct natural sunlight ranges as high as 10,000 foot candles while the

maximum intensity from a fluorescent fixture containing ten 8 foot tubes is only

approximately 1,000 foot candles at a distance of 10-12 inches.



SUNLIGHT'S ABILITY TQ STRENGTHEN THE BODYâ€™S IMMUNE SYSTEM

It is now believed that disease can only occur when one fails to maintain the

delicate balance of power between one's body and the organisms that produce disease.

This is so, for we find people who are carrying within themselves the germs capable of

causing an infection and yet they are apparently free of disease. Their body's immune

System is strong enough to keep these organisms from growing and

developing.

Studies have shown that exposure to natural sunlight increases

the number of white blood cel s in the human blood. The white blood



27



cel that increases the most is the lymphocyte, which is the one that plays a leading role in

defending the body against an invasion of germs.

Because the lymphocytes increase in number after a sunlight treatment, antibodies,

their products of defense, also increase in the blood (1) Ultraviolet light also has an effect

on the deep internal organs. The pancreas, stomach, liver, kidneys, and adrenal glands

are apparently benefited by sun light treatments seemingly due to the Stimulation of the

sympathetic nervous System.



SUNSHINE FIGHTS CANCER

Sunlight is able to speed up the body's metabolism to eliminate toxic poisons the

body has accumulated. The ultraviolet light would help to remove

them. Thus by aiding in the removal of many cancer-causing

agents, sunlight is able to reduce the incidence of cancer.(2)

Studies show that as the amount of available sunlight increases,

the incidence of internal cancer decreases. The total cancer

deaths of the various American states and Canadian provinces

are shown to fal with increasing available sunlight (3)

Sunlight increases the use of oxygen in the tissues. This can be very important in

stimulating the immune System especial y in the production of antibodies. Many types of

cancer cel s do not like oxygen, and when exposed to high concentrations they wil begin

to slow their growth and division, final y stopping completely (4) In this indirect way, sunlight

can fight against cancer, stimulating the immune System and increasing the oxygen in the

tissues.

In humans, the evidence that light is involved with cancer is coming into focus.

When the pineal gland in humans becomes calcified, it cuts down its production of

melatonin. This, in turn, stimulates the production of estrogen, which causes an increased

amount of breast cancer. Over 60% of Americans have calcified pineal glands when they

are over 50 years of age, while in Japan only 9.9% and in Nigeria 5% of the persons

beyond the age of 40 have calcified glands. Since the incidence of breast cancer is low in

Japan and South Africa and high in North America, it would appear, according to Dr.

Kirne, M. D. that calcified pineals are associated with an increased incidence of breast

cancer. The reasons why the pineal gland becomes calcified remain obscure. The low-

light intensity that the human eye receives while indoors combined with the lack of

Stimulation of the pineal gland, may be factors contributing to calcification of the pineal

gland.(5)



CAN SUNLIGHT CAUSE CANCER?

Some humans are very sensitive to sunlight and wil burn easily. Blond and red

haired persons seem to be most troubled with chronic burning. Skin cancer patients

appear to be very sensitive to sunlight. They sunburn more easily and the burned area

takes longer to heal. They also have a harder time tanning. The current medical concept

pictures a destructive sun, one responsible for aging of the skin and capable of causing

skin cancer. Research stemming from this concept provides Information on the sun and its

relation to human health. Undeniably, the sun plays a role in skin cancer and aging, but is

it the primary contributor?

Dr. Zane Kirne, M. D., author of Sunlight Could Save Your Life, became

increasingly convinced as he studied the available research data, that the highly refined

western diet, particularly that of refined oils, plays the leading role in the development of

skin cancer, and that sunlight seems only to accelerate the problem. The intake of salad

and cooking oils has increased dramatical y since 1909 when oils were consumed at the



28

rate of 1.5 pounds per person per year. By 1972, this figure had risen to18 Ibs. Now today,

it is over 58 Ibs. per person. There is little doubt, in the research literature, as to whether

or not a high fat diet promotes a higher and earlier incidence of skin cancer due to

ultraviolet light. Not only skin cancer, but breast and colon cancer as wel , seem to be

increased by a high fat diet (6) Not only does saturated fat stimulate cancer formation, but

unsaturated or polyunsaturated fat wil do the same in many cases. In scientific literature,

the polyunsaturated fats are shown to apparently stimulate cancer formation more quickly

than do the saturated fats.(7)

Nutrition and sunlight are intimately related. Sunshine on the skin produces certain

hormones and nutrients like Vitamin D. Unless one has a proper diet, sunlight has an il

effect on the skin. This must be emphasized: sun bathing is dangerous for those who are

on the Standard high-fat American diet (which is 45% fat) or who do not get an abundance

of vegetables, whole grains, and fresh fruits. It is not only the dietary fat that promotes skin

cancer formation, but also fat of oil applied directly to the skin. This is why sun bathing

lotions, creams, or oils cannot be recommended, for they may stimulate cancer formation.

Polyunsaturated fat, itself has been shown to inhibit the immune System. In fact, it does

this so wel that researchers are now using polyunsaturated fat in the diets of kidney

transplant patients and those with skin grafts taken from other people, so the patientÅ›

bodies wil not reject the foreign tissue.



SUNSHINE LOWERS CHOLESTEROL

Cholesterol is a substance that can only be found in meat, poultry, fish, and animal
