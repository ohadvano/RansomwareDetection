I roll my eyes, she can't be serious. “Sam, you think that just because you've seen his genitals, you can stalk him?”
Sam's eyes widen. “Alice he is hung and I mean really hung. At this point, I don't even care about the fact that he turns into a wolf.”
I shake my head, look down at the other end of the corridor to see Ryder leaning against the lockers, looking in our direction.
“I'm so gonna rock his world one day.” Sam takes out her phone again with a big smile on her face.
“What exactly are you stalking him on?” I look back at her.
Her eyes are glued to the phone. “Everything.”
I'm laughing by the time she finishes talking. “You have a serious problem.”
Sam shrugs. “It's only wrong if he finds out.”
“And when he does? Then what?” I arch my brow waiting for her answer.
Sam shrugs. “I'm not gonna apologise if that's what you wanna hear.”
I shake my head and roll my eyes when I see Mr. Edmund advancing in our direction. He unlocks the door and places himself in front of the whiteboard. He looks at each person individually as they come into the classroom, but stares coldly at the four who are last to enter the room.
“Don't take your seats yet everyone. We're going to have a little change in the classroom today because I feel that the people in the back are not concentrating as they should be.” He crosses his arms and looks towards the back.
“Right, can I have Kellan come sit next to Alice in the front here? Sam move to the next desk please,.” Kellan comes to sit next to me in the front. Our desk is in the middle with one desk on either side.
Kellan nudges me in greeting, I smile in response.
“Bane? Get your feet off the table now, I won't tell you again and come sit next to Sam please.”
Mr. Edmund stands in front of Sam's desk, waits for Bane to sit down and leans into his face. “I will not tolerate this kind of behaviour in my classroom, Bane. I can easily fail you at the end of the year seeing that every test you've done you've managed to fail. Congratulations, your parents must be so proud.”
Mr. Edmund leans down closer to him. “Don't give me a reason to kick you out of my class because mark my words Bane, I want you out. Failures are not welcomed in my classroom.”
Mr. Edmund may think that no one can hear him but there are four wolves in here that can clearly hear him. I can hear clearly but I'm sitting close by. The rest of the class would think that Mr. Edmund's just giving Bane a warning, but they don't know the real meaning of what's being said. What's gotten into him?
When I look over at Bane I see that his jaw is tensed firmly and his eyes look deadly. I look him over and see that his fist is clenched tightly under the desk; out of sight. I look more closely to see blood dripping from inside his palm - caused by his razor-sharp claws. I look up in panic hoping that Mr. Edmund hasn't noticed, but his attention has gone back to the classroom.
He points to the back. “Ryder and Silver in the front. Now. Liam and Luna go to the back. The middle row is fine as far as I'm concerned.”
Mr. Edmund waits until everyone is seated and clears his throat. “Now I won't be able to stay for the rest of the lesson because a new student was in an incident here yesterday, and I have to leave to speak with him. I don't know what happened but that person has been severely hurt. I'll be back as soon as possible.”
He collects his things and heads for the door. “I don't want anyone leaving this classroom under any circumstance. If I hear that any student has left this classroom, I will gladly mark every test paper of theirs an F.” He turns and leaves out the door without another word.
As soon as the classroom door closes, everyone starts to talk amongst themselves. I hear Mr Edmund's name mentioned several times. They're probably wondering the same thing as everyone else. What happened to him that's suddenly made him want to change the room around and behave this way?
I look back at Bane to see his eyes are closed tightly, sweat knits his forehead and he's taking deep breaths. Sam is talking to someone behind her and I can hear behind me that Kellan's talking to Silver and Ryder.
I slowly reach up with my hand and carefully place my hand on Bane's shoulder. The second it makes contact, his eyes immediately swing to me and stares motionless at me.
“Bane?” I whisper.
He stares at me but remains silent. I lean in closer. “Bane?”
“I'm....try...trying.....to control..my...myself.”He grunts. “Do you need me to do anything? Do you need some air?”
“One more word and I'll shift. Leave me the hell alone.” He growls and rushes out of the classroom so fast hardly anyone notices his absence.
Leaning back in my seat, Kellan turns away from Ryder and Silver. I notice the three of them frowning when they realize that Bane is nowhere to be seen.
“Where's Bane?”
Ryder rounds my desk, leans down to me and snaps, “What the hell did you say to him to make him run off like that?”
I didn't expect this kind of response from Ryder. “Excuse me? You think I'm the reason he's gone?”
“You're the one who spoke to him last. I was watching you.”
He snarls at me.
Kellan sees the confused look on my face. “It's not her fault. It was the teacher's.”
Ryder takes one more look at me and storms out of the classroom.
Kellan places his hand on my back comfortingly. Too bad I'm not up for a back rub.
“Don't take it seriously.”
“He's trying to protect me?” I place my bag over my shoulder. “What a load of shit.”
“Alice, you okay?” Sam looks at me with worry etched on her face.
“Yeah, I'll speak to you later.”
I rush out of the classroom and out towards the back of the school, to the empty football field.
When I reach the field, I slowly take a deep breath, hold it and release it.
There's no explaining my escape to Mr Edmund if he ever finds out. Who am I kidding? He's never gonna know.
I sit on the dry cut grass and look up at the sky.
Being alone with my thoughts is actually quite peaceful, but I can't help but wonder who was hurt last night. Could it be someone that I know? But I hope that whoever got hurt isn't suffering too much.
And Bane? I hope he shifts and never changes back. Never will I understand the reason he is the way that he is. The same goes for all of them except for Kellan.
Since last night, I feel like I understand Kellan a lot better.
It's still hard to believe that Anna was Ryder's sister. They looked nothing alike and yet I didn't have the pleasure of meeting her or getting to know her. From what I remember, Anna was nothing like Ryder; the complete opposite. I dread to think what happened when they found her body.
Who would do such an animalistic thing?
I must have been thinking really hard because I don't hear the person shouting my name from behind me. I turn around and from afar I see a lone figure standing on crutches. I squint my eyes to see who it is but it's too blurry to make out the person. I look around to see if it was my name that was being called, but realises there's only me outside.
I stand and walk towards the figure.
When I come somewhat closer to the person, I don't expect that person to be Max.
What the hell?
When I stand in front of Max, I'm completely speechless. His whole face was black and blue.
Black eyes circle around his eyes, his right cheek is badly bruised and his lips are twice the size of yesterday with nasty looking cuts on both sides of his lips. Not to mention that he's on crutches with god knows how many bruises underneath his clothes.
“Hey, you.” Max smiles at me.
How can he smile beneath his beaten face? “Max.	what?”
Max looks down at the ground. “You noticed the face, huh?”
“It's kind of hard not to notice, and it's not just the face.”
I gasp when I look down to see that his foot is in a cast. “What happened to you?”
He shrugs. “Basketball's a rough sport and people get hurt.”
I frown.
Is he being serious?
“Not rough enough to look like this!?” Max says nothing.
“Did.	did someone do this to you?”
Who would do this to a new student? It just doesn't make sense.
Max laughs nervously. “Of course not, Alice. I told you what happened.”
Why is a part of me not believing him?
“Right. Basketball.” I place my hands in my pockets and look at him unconvincingly.
“You don't believe me?” Max frowns. “I don't know what to say.”
“Max, look at yourself! You've clearly been beaten up!” I shriek. “Who would do such a thing to you?”
Again Max says nothing. “Max?”
Max pauses for a second. “I didn't wanna say anything.” “About what?”
Max clears his throat and looks away from me. “Something happened yesterday.”
“At school?” He nods.
“When you left yesterday, I went into the changing rooms to change into my kit, and I heard the door closing a few minutes after I stepped in. Before I knew it, I was jumped from behind, and I couldn't defend myself being that I was outnumbered.”
“Did you see who it was?”
“Yeah.” He looks up at me. “It was Ryder and the two guys who hang around with him.”
“What!?”
Max shrugs. “Look, don't worry about it. It's my problem, not yours, okay? I don't know the reason why it happened.”
None of this makes sense to me. Why would Ryder target someone like Max?
“I just don't understand why he'd do this to you.”
Max chuckled. “It's obvious, isn't it? He wants me to stay away from you.”
I can't help but roll my eyes. Ryder had no right to do this.
“Max...I don't know what to say other than I'm so sorry. Ryder and I are nothing to each other. I hope this doesn't interfere with our friendship.”
“Of course, it doesn't, Alice. I just wanted to see you even though I look like shit.”
“Yeah, you do.”
Before I know it we're both laughing.
After what feels like minutes of laughing I remember the notes I have for Max in my bag. I open it and grab my pink flowery folder.
“I'm sorry I didn't give these to you yesterday. It was kind of a hectic day.”
Max looks at the folder and frowns. “What's this?”
“My Biology notes that Mr. Thompson asked me to print out for you.”
“Oh right. Thanks.”
He takes the folder and holds it.
How is he going to hold the folder if he's on crutches? “You sure you can manage?”
“I'm actually not staying. My mother's coming to pick me up.”
He puts the folder under his arm and puts his hands on the handles.
“Okay. Well, I hope you get better and I'm really sorry about Ryder.”
“Alice, you don't need to apologise on his behalf, besides he obviously sees me as a threat.” Max smirks.
'Yeah, I guess he does.” I chuckle. “'I'll see you soon Max.”
“See ya.”
He turns around and hobbles slowly out of the school.
Watching him walk like that stirs something inside of me. It angers me that Ryder would do such a thing and to outnumber him.
Did Kellan take part in this? Three wolves taking on one harmless, innocent boy.
What a bunch of monsters!
I let my anger take over and rush to where the wolves might possibly be. Knowing Ryder he's probably outside on the basketball court.
I know I'm right when I see three males practising passing the ball completely topless.
Ryder stiffens when he sees me approaching.
He walks towards me with the same snarling look he had pointed at me earlier, but it's time for Ryder to have a piece of my mind because I'm furious.
When I reach him I don't think, I just act.
I slap him hard across the face that instantly causes my palm to sting.
Ryder's face is beyond fury. “What the fuck was that for!?”
“You know damn well what that was for!” I point my finger right into his face.
“What the hell are you talking about?” He spits. “Don't lie, Ryder! Not to me!”
My body is shaking with so much fury that I can barely look at him let alone seeing him without a shirt on.
Ryder steps closer to me and I can hear him growling. “You think I'd lie to you?”
“Explain Max's injuries then! Why did you do it?”
He looks taken aback. “I don't know what you're talking about.”
I shove at his chest. A chest that is so unbelievably solid that he doesn't move.
“Stop lying to me! You know exactly what you did to Max.”
Ryder takes both of my hands and pins them behind my back. “I've done nothing to him.”
Bane and Kellan run towards us. They're both probably wondering what's keeping their Alpha, they both wear confused expressions.
“Have you both seen the state of him!?” “What's going on here?” Bane frowns.
I try to struggle out of Ryder's hold but stop when I realise that he's too strong.
“Let go of me!”
He releases me instantly.
I look at each of them individually. “Why did you do it?”
Kellan frowns while Bane still looks confused. “Alice, what are you talking about?”
“Were you a part of this too Kellan?”
I can't help but feel hurt that Kellan might've taken part in this. “Max? The new guy? Ring any bells. You know, the guy you three beat up yesterday.”
Neither of them says a word.
“All three of you are unbelievable, you know that? I didn't expect this from you Kellan, maybe from them but not you!” I can feel my anger rise when I hear Bane and Ryder growl. “You disgust me.”
I turn to leave but not before someone grabs a hold of my arm.
I roll my eyes when I see it's Ryder.
“You've had your chance to speak, now it's my turn to talk.”
He leans into me and brushes his lips over my ear. My whole body shivers as he whispers to me. “Don't ever slap me again otherwise I'll have to do something about it.
Now, for beating up your precious friend, if I remember correctly, Kellan and I were at the diner right after you left yesterday. And for Bane?” Ryder shrugs. “He doesn't give a shit about anybody but seeing as he doesn't know what the hell you're talking about, then I guess you're at a loss here.”
He turns away from me with Bane on his heels.
Kellan remains looking at the ground. “You really think we'd do something like that?”
“Kellan, I don't know what to believe right now, but if you saw the state Max is in then you wouldn't know what to think.”
“Alice, we don't just go around beating people.”
“Then, how do you explain Max's injuries? Did you know that he's on crutches?”
Kellan's voice starts to rise. “So, you think that we did it? If you do then you obviously don't know who we are.”
“Then why would he accuse you three and lie to me?” Kellan shrugs. “You're asking the wrong person.”
I remain silent.
Kellan looks at me sympathetically, turns around and join the others on the court.
Even though a part of me still thinks that Ryder had something to do with Max, Kellan does have a point. Maybe they had nothing to do with Max's injuries but then again, why would he lie to me in the first place?
I'm shaking my head by the time I walk into the cafeteria. I see Sam straight away at the salad bar filling up her plate with lettuce and cucumber. She sees the fury on my face and walks straight to me.
“Why do you look like you're about to kill someone?” “I'll tell you later after I've calmed down a bit.”
“That bad?”
I nod. “Yeah. Would it be alright if I came over to your house tonight? I'm gonna call in sick at work.”
“You know by now that you're always welcome to come over.”
After spending lunch with Sam, we part ways to the last lessons of the day, leaving Sam with Math and French for me.
When the bell chimes for the end of the lesson, students fill the corridors as they leave through the gargantuan doors of the school.
I decide to wait for Sam next to her black Porsche, and when I hear wolf whistles coming from the jocks, I know that Sam's nearby. When I see her approaching she rolls her eyes and shakes her head.
“Every fucking day.”
Sam unlocks the car and we both get in. “You love it really.” I wink.
Sam gives me the middle finger and starts the car.
Chapter 10

“You slapped him!?”
Sam and I sit on her bed eating chocolates while watching Gossip Girl. Before we arrived at her house, I told her everything about Max and what he told me.
“Yeah, and I don't regret it either. Is that bad?”
Sam snorts. “Are you kidding me, he had it coming.”
“I just don't know who to believe.” I pick up a piece of chocolate and shove it in my mouth.
She shrugs. 'I mean, I can see where you're coming from. You've got Ryder who's an Alpha and has his own pack. We don't know what kind of pack they are and what they do or what they're capable of, but they don't really seem that bad. Yes, they might have anger issues but I've never heard or seen them beat up a random person before. As for Max, we have no idea who he is or his history. I mean we just met him yesterday, and he seems like a genuinely nice guy but again we don't really know him.” Sam turns the TV volume down. “We're at an impasse, Alice.”
I lie on my side and sigh. “It just doesn't make sense! Why would Max say that Ryder, Kellan and Bane beat him up? Unless Ryder's a good liar and he's brainwashed his pack to believing that they didn't do it.”
“Look, I think it's been a long day. We need to chill, not mention any boys and just watch Chuck Bass being sexy.”
“That sounds great, but I'm more of a Nate Archibald fan.”
After hours of watching episodes of Gossip Girl and eating piles of chocolate, we decide to turn in for an early night. I leave her room to go down the kitchen for a glass of milk, when I feel my head starting to pound. It's probably caused after the shouting and the stress of today.
I shake it off, grab a glass, open the fridge and grab the milk.
As I pour the milk into the glass my whole body feels like it's going through a heat wave, and everything around me starts to blur.
Oh, no! Please, no!
My legs give out beneath me making the glass in my hand shatter to the floor into a million pieces. I taste a metallic tang in my mouth that tastes a lot like blood. Inside my mouth, I feel an agonising pain in my oral cavity that's unbearable to cope with. I carefully run my tongue along the bottom of my mouth and freeze. I start to feel very sharp canine teeth forming on top of my human teeth. My hearing becomes clearer which allows me to hear my heart racing inside my chest. Shaking with fear, my legs start to numb leaving me no choice but to double over onto the floor on all fours. I can hear Sam running down the stairs shouting my name repeatedly, but I have no strength to answer her. The pain in my stomach becomes so unbearable that it makes it hard for me to breathe properly. My arms start to ache from trying to keep upright off the floor. What I don't expect next is for my hands to start hurting. I squint hard enough to concentrate on my left hand to see what's causing the pain, and realize my nails have elongated into sharp claws. The pain is excruciating.
It's actually happening! I'm turning!
My blurry vision allows me to see a form entering the kitchen. The moment Sam sees me on the floor shaking uncontrollably, she screams so loud that it hurts my eardrums.
She crouches down in front of me. “Alice!?” She places her hand gently on my shoulder. “Please......help...me.”
I place my head on the tile floor to cool myself down.
“What do you want me to do!? Tell me how I can help you.” She cries.
“Get..Ry...Ryder. He can help.” Sam's already reaching for her phone.
I don't know why I asked Sam to call him, but what other choice did I have? Maybe with his guidance, he'll help me survive this change, but one thing is for sure that I can't take any more of this pain.
If this happens every time I change I don't think I'd have the strength to do it.
“It's happening! So, get your wolf ass to my house right now!”
She slams the phone into the receiver and rushes back to me.
“He's on his way, Alice! Everything's gonna be fine.”
After what feels like hours, we both hear the front door slam. “Alice!?|
“She's in here! Hurry!” Sam yells from the floor. She's has not left my side.
Ryder appears in the kitchen doorway wearing nothing but black jeans.
“Couldn't you at least put on a shirt before you came here?”
Sam arches a brow, but Ryder ignores her and crouches down next to me.
He places his hand gently on my forehead and hisses, “She's too hot.”
He shakes his head in dismay.
“What do you suggest we do? Move her?”
“Yup.” He carefully picks me up and carries me out of the kitchen. “Where's the bathroom?”
“Should you be moving her? She doesn't look good at all and she looks really pale.”
“Sam! Where's your bathroom!?” Ryder yells.
“Upstairs, first door on the right.”
Sam follows Ryder every step of the way. “What are you gonna do?”
Ryder rushes up the stairs, into the bathroom and sits me down on the toilet. I can hardly keep myself upright, but Sam moves to hold my hand to steady me.
“We're gonna put her in the bathtub and fill it with cold water.”
He reaches over and turns the cold tap on then turns to me while the water runs. “You're gonna be alright.” He cups my cheeks. “I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.”
I can do nothing but stare at him. I try hard to say anything but stop when I realize that I can't. It's like I'm struggling to form words. Ryder notices and frowns at me.
With his hand, he opens my mouth and wheezes. “Her teeth are starting to break through.”
He turns back to the bathtub and turns the tap off. “Is that a good thing?” Sam urges.
“It's a good thing because it means that the change won't be as complicated.”
Ryder picks me up into a standing position and grabs the hem of my dungarees.
“What do you think you're doing?” Sam snaps as she pushes his hands away from me.
“What does it look like I'm doing? I'm undressing her.”
Ryder unbuckles the straps and removes it leaving me only in a long sleeved shirt and my underwear.
My body feels incredibly weak to argue with him about it.
“I don't think she'd approve of you seeing her in her underwear.”
“I don't think she's in her right mind to decide whether she approves it or not.” He grabs the hem of the shirt and lifts it up to my abdomen. Sam lifts both of my arms above my head.
Sam gasps. “Look! Her fingers!” Claws. Razor-sharp claws.
“I know.” Ryder picks me up gently and puts me into the cold water.
I sigh in delight once my body touches the cool surface.
I grab onto his arm. “How much longer?” I struggle to burst out.
Ryder brushes back my hair. “Not long now.” He rushes out of the bathroom.
Sam sits on the bathtub and smiles at me. “You okay? You scared the hell out of me.”
I close my eyes tightly as the pain in my abdomen starts to burn. “I just want this to end.”
Sam grabs my hand out of the water and holds it tightly. “Me too.”
Ryder comes back into the room with a blanket.
“What happens now?” Sam moves out of the way for Ryder to pick me out of the water.
“I need to lay her down, preferably somewhere that's comfortable.”
Ryder wraps me in the blanket and picks me up again. “She can lie on my bed.”
Sam leads the way into her room with Ryder and me on her heel.
When we reach the bedroom, Ryder puts me down gently and looks me over.
“Is she gonna be okay?”
“Her teeth and claws have formed perfectly but..” Ryder places his hand on my abdomen.
“But what?” Sam sits next to me on the bed.
“Her bones need to break through, and it's not gonna be pretty.”
Ryder holds my hand reassuringly.
Sam crosses her arms over her chest. “Will that be the last thing that happens to her because I can't stand to see her like this?”
“Sam, it needs to happen whether she likes it or not. She was stupid enough to fight the first time. She would have avoided all of this if she would have listened to me.”
Sam jumps off the bed and confronts Ryder. “How dare you speak about her like that! It's not her fault!”
I'm lying on the bed drenched in sweat with my whole body in indescribable pain when I notice that both Sam and Ryder arguing. I struggle to open my mouth to make them stop, but I can't do anything other than listen to them.
How much longer!?
Suddenly my back arches off the bed, and I hear the cracking snap of my bones breaking and reforming throughout my body. I'm screaming at the gut-wrenching pain it's causing inside of me. Sam and Ryder stop arguing when they hear the ear splitting scream that leaves my mouth.
“This is it.” Ryder helps me off the bed and gently puts me on the floor.
“Oh my God, it's happening.” Sam shrieks.
“Sam be quiet.” He cups my cheeks. “You're doing really well.”
“Am I gonna die?” I'm trying to focus on Ryder's face through my blurry haze.
“Absolutely not because you know why, Alice?” “Why?”
The bones in my legs start snapping and it's causing me to grunt in pain.
“Because I won't let you. I know it hurts, but this is the worst part and then it's all over. You'll never have to go through it again.”
I nod as he moves away from me. “We need to give her space.”
He grabs Sam's arm and pulls her towards the doorway.
When they leave me on the floor in complete agony, I feel everything inside me going warm.
The room's silence is interrupted with more intense sounds of my bones breaking, making me have this urge to let go. The bones in my face hurt so much that I can't stop the tears from falling.
Sam struggles in Ryder's hold.
“Let me go to her! She's struggling!” Sam screams.
Ryder grunts as she elbows his chest. “She's doing what needs to be done!”
When I feel the bones start to change the shape of my face, I go to scream but it's not a scream that leaves my mouth.
What does leave my mouth is a loud piercing howl that's probably loud enough to scare the living creatures nearby, and the urge to burst comes almost unexpectedly.
I feel like a bomb is about to go off inside me, and then it happens.
I'm standing on all fours; body perfectly formed into a wolf.
My wolf instinct has taken over my entire body, and I'm left speechless. I'm looking at myself at a distance in Sam's floor length mirror, and all I can do is look at myself.
There are no words.
My body feels so strong and muscular.
Fur as white as snow covers my whole body, sharp white teeth and long pointy ears.
I turn my head to look at Sam and Ryder, to see both of their eyes wide in shock. Neither of them says a word. I walk over on my unsteady legs and approach them. Ryder looks at me straight in the eye and he freezes. For some reason that causes me to start growling directly at him.
“Why is she growling at you?” Sam asks Ryder from the doorway.
“Alice knows me but her wolf doesn't. She thinks I'm a threat to her.”
“And are you?”
“We'll see what he has to say.” I tilt my head when Ryder starts shifting so effortlessly into a wolf.
And by a wolf, I mean an Alpha.
What I see is a large black mass of fur with bright red eyes. I can feel myself shrinking back when I hear him let out a loud and long howl.
His ears are raised and pointed forwards, fangs and teeth are barred.
He's clearly showing me who the Alpha is.
I lower my head in submission hoping he'll realize I'm not challenging him, but the next thing I know I'm lifting my head and growling back at him.
Sam stares at the both of us in bewilderment. “Don't you dare!”
Ryder turns around and growls at Sam causing her to jump in fright. Seeing Sam frightened stirs something inside of me, and straight away I'm lunging straight at Ryder; going right for his face.
He sees it coming straight away and tackles me. Sam starts screaming when she sees me and Ryder fighting vigorously on the floor.
“Stop it! Both of you are gonna hurt yourselves!”
I force Ryder off me and lunge for him again only to be shoved roughly against the mirror. Once my body makes contact with it, the shards of the glass break from the impact.
I lie on the floor for a second only to get back up from the adrenaline and lunge again at Ryder's back. Ryder wraps his teeth around my neck and pulls me off of him and he doesn't let go.
He drags me from my neck past Sam, out of the bedroom and down the stairs. He has such a tight grip on me that it's impossible to get out of it.
The moment we reach Sam's garden, Ryder releases me and backs away. By the time Sam joins us, Ryder has shifted back into his human form, wearing only his trousers, he looks down at me with a frown on his face.
“Turn her back!” Sam snaps.
He turns to her with a snarl. “Don't tell me what to do.” 'Turn her back now!”
Ryder ignores her and crouches down beside me.
I'm too weak to move from my position on the floor, and I think he knows that too.
I lie on the floor and close my eyes, I don't know how but I feel my body suddenly changing, and it does so without any effort. I'm aware that I have no clothes on and that Ryder's sitting next to me, but I no longer care about looking decent for anyone.
“Move!” Sam nudges Ryder out of the way and places a fluffy blanket over me.
I gather the strength to sit up from the floor and wrap the blanket around myself.
I look at Sam to see her eyes welling with tears. “Alice?”
I pause for a minute and laugh. “I'm alive!” Sam starts to laugh too. “I know!”
Sam reaches over and hugs me tightly. I gasp. “Did you see me!?”
“I saw everything, and I couldn't be more proud of you!”
Then I remember the fighting. “Sam! I'm so sorry about your mirror!”
Sam shrugs. 'Don't worry about it. It wasn't even your fault.” Sam looks behind me and sneers.
I turn around and meet Ryder's expressionless face. “You owe me a new mirror!”
Sam marches into the house and slams the door behind her.
Wrapped up in the blanket, I get up from the floor and stand, neither of us move.
After a few minutes of silence, Ryder decides to break the silence.
“You didn't see your eyes, did you?” He frowns. “No.” I answer bluntly.
The mirror was too far for me to see that close. Ryder says nothing.
What did he see?
“Was something wrong with them?” He says nothing and looks away.
I'm starting to get very impatient with him, “Ryder!”
Ryder's head swivels back to look at me. “The colour of your eyes was unexpected.”
“Why? What colour were they?” He pauses for a long time. “Red.”
A pause.
“What?” I whisper.
“Red, your eyes were red.”
What? Surely he's lying...
Ryder clears his throat and frowns. “You're an Alpha.”
Chapter 11

“What!?” I spluttered. “That's impossible!”
I can't believe what I'm hearing, it just doesn't make sense at all. Me? An Alpha? That doesn't seem right.
“I know, but it's what you are.”
“Yeah, but how? You should know about this stuff!”
For someone who's been a wolf all his life, he should know why this has happened.
“I don't know! I'm just as confused as you are.”
None of us says anything for a while, I think we're both in shock.
“And by the way, I'm fine. Thanks for asking.” Ryder looks at me in confusion. “What?”
I place my hands on my hips. “Have you forgotten about the part of you attacking me?”
“Are you being serious? Because if I remember, you're the one who started it.”
I roll my eyes. “Very mature.”
I turn away from him and enter back into the house to see Sam cleaning up the milk and the glass off the floor.
“Sam let me do that.”
Sam puts the broken glass in the trashcan and smiles at me. “It's done. Don't worry about it.” He points outside.
“Has he left?”
“No, unfortunately.” I wrap the blanket tighter around me. Ryder walks into the kitchen. “I can hear you, you know?” He closes the door and leans against it.
Sam walks right up to him, and with her finger, she points the middle of his chest. “You can leave now.”
He ignores her and walks over to me. His eyes caress me.
Men...
“Are you alright at least?” “Like you care?”
I turn away and walk up the stairs, I hear him following me.
“Believe it or not, I actually do care about you. I wouldn't be here if I didn't.”
When I reach Sam's bathroom I ignore Ryder, grab my clothes from the floor and go into Sam's bedroom to change. I see the broken shards of glass all over Sam's carpet and feel a great amount of guilt.
I'll have to buy her a new one.
“My transformation was a success, you're no longer needed.”
With my back to Ryder, I drop the blanket, I hear Ryder suck in a breath behind me.
“Alice, you don't mean that.”
“Actually, I do. And by the way, I still haven't forgotten about what you did.”
I grab the shirt from the floor and pull it over my head.
I feel Ryder's presence coming closer and closer just as he stops right behind me, I hear his breathing against my neck. “I hope you're not talking about who I think you are.”
When he places his hands on my hips, my breathing increases.
“What you did was unforgivable.”
Picturing Max's beaten face and him standing on crutches brings back the anger I had earlier today.
Ryder leans in close to my ear, his mouth slightly touching the top of my ear. “And I told you that I didn't do it.”
His whole body frames mine so perfectly that I lean slightly backwards into his tall frame. He leans forward, wraps his arm around my waist and pulls me tighter to him. I feel his warm, solid chest against my back.
“How do I know if you're telling the truth?” “Then, you'll just have to trust me.”
He rubs his nose behind my ear causing a shiver to run down my back.
