
complex carbohydrate food that contain natural fiber we would not have today's epidemic

of high cholesterol. The more natural the food the better. Oat bran, for example, is not a

whole natural food, for the bran has been removed from the oat. It would be better to use

oatmeal as opposed to oat bran.



Another way to help lower cholesterol is by sunbathing. It is important to note that

cholesterol and Vitamin D are related, for when cholesterol in the skin is exposed to

sunlight, it may easily be changed to Vitamin D and thereby made harmless to the body. It

was in 1904 that one research scientist discovered that sunlight was able to transform

cholesterol to Vitamin D. Human skin has a very rich supply of cholesterol, and this

cholesterol keeps moving back and forth between the skin and the blood stream. If it is

removed from the skin, then the cholesterol from the blood stream moves into the skin to



95

replace the cholesterol that was lost. It has been found that sunlight wil cause a reduction

of cholesterol in the skin and it also affects the overal cholesterol metabolism of the whole

body. When the skin is exposed to sunlight, cholesterol is destroyed so rapidly and to

such a great extent that the total body cholesterol is decreased. A study was done using

30 patients who had hardening of the arteries. Each of these patient's blood cholesterol

level was taken before a sunbath. The results showed that there was almost a 13%

decrease in the blood cholesterol fol owing the treatment.(3)

You may wonder then, if I sunbathe to lower my cholesterol, what do I do about the

possibility of getting skin cancer from al the sunbathing? According to Dr. Kime, in his

book, Sunlight Could Save Your Life, if you take a moderate amount of sun and do not eat

meat, animal products or refined oils, your chances of getting skin cancer are rare. There

is little doubt in the research literature, as to whether or not a high fat diet promotes a

higher and earlier incidence of skin cancer due to ultraviolet light.(4)

For years we have accepted cholesterol levels of 250-300 mg% as "normal" in our

society because ninety percent of Americans fal into that range. While these levels may

be common for Americans, (where every second person dies of atherosclerosis), they are

not ideal. The ideal cholesterol is 100 plus your age, not to exceed 160 mg%. Dr. Antonio

Gotto M.D., president of the American Heart Association, stated in a U.S. Senate hearing,

that if we lower the cholesterol count of everyone in the United States to below 150 mg%,

we would probably wipe out heart disease. (5)



There are several cholesterol lowering drugs. Big expensive investigations of these

drugs report success in reducing blood cholesterol by levels of five to ten percent.

Unfortunately, none of these drugs improve life expectancy. On the contrary, they prove

more harmful than helpful. They produce unpleasant and distressing effects and

excessive mortality. (6)



The more we learn about cholesterol, the more we realize that by fol owing a

natural diet, the one given to us in the Garden of Eden, the healthier we wil be.

DEODORANTS

AND ANTIPERSPIRANTS





Perspiration is a normal body function. Basical y, three things are accomplished by

sweating: the body temperature is control ed by cooling, certain wastes are removed from

the body, and the skin is kept smooth and pliable.

Sweat never lets up: the body is constantly perspiring - up to a quart per day - even

when one is immersed in water.

Most perspiration is produced by a secretion from the endocrine sweat glands -

glands distributed over almost the entire surface of the body's skin. The eccrine glands are

usual y active only during exercise, on hot days or during nervousness or embarrassment.

Mil ions of Americans are concerned about the perspiration problem and what to

buy to combat the problem. Americans spend close to two bil ion dol ars ($1.7) on

deodorants and antiperspirants each year.

Mum was the first commercial personal deodorant product sold in this country in 1888. It

contained bacteria-squelching zinc oxide and was smeared on with the finger. Before this,

ammonia and water, talcum powders and perfumes had been used. Antiperspirants came

a few years later, but the early products in this field were plagued by a number of

problems. At that time, many antiperspirants were a solution of aluminum chloride.



Is there a difference between a deodorant and an antiperspirant? Yes! A deodorant

prevents the development of odor in perspiration. It is designed to combat odors, but wil

not keep you dryer since it does not reduce the amount of perspiration. Deodorants simply

mask odor. An antiperspirant reduces the amount of perspiration that reaches the skin's

surface. It is designed to reduce the amount of wetness.

Antiperspirants are more complicated, both in composition and action. Like

deodorants, they almost always contain bactericidal agents. However, they do not stop

there, as it's their intention to prevent moisture, as wel as odor. Their containers always

show a listing of active ingredients, the most common of which is aluminum salts -

chloride, sulfate, chlorohydrate, although zinc, zirconium and other compounds are also

found. In composition and action, antiperspirants are very similar to facial astringents.

Antiperspirants contain astringents that swel and coagulate protein in the skin, thus

reducing the pores through which perspiration is discharged. Astringents are composed of



97

various aluminum salts. This aluminum is readily absorbed through the skin, and we know

that aluminum is a poison to the human body.

Cleanliness is the first step in combating perspiration. A daily bath or shower

(preferably at night) fol owed by thorough rinsing is mandatory. Also drinking a minimum of

2 quarts of water daily wil help

keep the blood stream clean which wil reduce the amount of poisons the skin has to

eliminate.

A natural deodorant one could use is a fresh lemon cut in half and rubbed under the

arms; or one can find a few good natural deodorants in Health Food Stores. Be sure to

read the labels for the list of ingredients to determine if it real y is natural.



98





DIABETES





About 10 mil ion persons in the United States have diabetes, although almost half

of them are unaware that they are diabetic. Three out often diabetics end up in the

hospital every year. Eight out of ten diabetics develop eye problems. Diabetes is the

leading cause of new blindness. Diabetics are eighteen times more likely to experience

severe kidney damage than are non-diabetics: 25 percent of kidney dialysis patients are

diabetics. Diabetes more than doubles the risk of heart disease and stroke.

There are two types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is cal ed insulin-dependent

diabetes or juvenile diabetes. The onset is sudden in children and young adults and

accounts for about 20 percent of al known cases of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is known

as non insulin-dependent diabetes or Adult onset diabetes. This type affects people of

middle-age and older. Of this group at least 90 percent are obese.



SYMPTOMS

The most common symptoms of diabetes include constant hunger, frequent

urination, being always thirsty, weakness, loss of weight, mental depression, dry red

tongue, blindness, irritability, restlessness and poor circulation. Not al these symptoms

are present in every case.

The normal blood sugar is 80-120 mg/dl., but can rise after a meal up to 150

mg/100 ml. of blood. When the blood sugar exceeds 180, it wil spil over into the urine. To

excrete the sugar, water is taken from the tissues causing frequent urination and

increased thirst. The appetite is often increased because we are not ful y utilizing the food

we normal y eat.

A diabetic coma is caused by not enough insulin, causing high blood sugar.

Symptoms are headache, thirst, frequent urination and fatigue. The face becomes red, the

skin hot and dry, and the breath has a sweetish odor. Nausea and vomiting sometimes

occur. Respirations become rapid and the pulse increases. If insulin and fluid are not

given immediately the person wil lose consciousness.

Insulin shock is caused by too much insulin causing low blood sugar. Its symptoms

are nervousness, pal or, hunger, perspiration and behavior that resembles intoxication. If a

complex carbohydrate (such as ripe fruit) is not given promptly, the individual becomes

drowsy, disoriented and eventual y unconscious.



99

In 1981 diabetics in the United States needed the glands of 56 mil ion animals to

meet their insulin needs. To produce a single pound of animal insulin, the amount required

to maintain approximately 750 diabetics for a single year, 8,000 pounds of glands from

23,500 animals were required. In the past, insulin was obtained in tiny amounts

exclusively from the glands of pigs and cattle supplied by slaughter houses.



Insulin, a preparation used in the medical treatment of diabetes, is prepared from

animal pancreas, usual y pork or beef; there is also human insulin available. Orinase,

Tolinase, Diabinese or Dymelor are oral medicines which many Type 2 diabetics take.

These medicines are not insulin, but drugs that stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin.

There are many natural ways to stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin without taking

the drugs which have side effects.



NATURAL WAYS TO HELP

Diet - There is not a known remedy that wil cure diabetes without a reformation

along the lines that caused it. The number one dietary consideration for diabetes must be

a strict vegetarian, low calorie, alkaline diet of high quality natural foods. Plenty of whole

grains, bran and oatmeal are very beneficial in diabetes, as wel as raw vegetables of al

kinds - red cabbage, cauliflower, watercress, brussel sprouts, okra, cucumbers, onions,

etc. A big emphasis needs to be placed on raw foods as they stimulate the pancreas and

increase insulin production. Green beans and cucumber juice contain a hormone needed

by the cel s of the pancreas in order to produce insulin. No table sugar should be used.

When sugar is eaten and absorbed into the blood stream, it requires insulin and a trace

element cal ed chromium to move the sugar from the blood stream into the cel s where it

can be burned for energy. In the diabetic the insulin is missing. Therefore sugar piles up in

the blood stream and cannot move into the cel . When insulin is given, the sugar is able to

move into the cel and the sugar level wil drop in the blood stream. If chromium is missing,

the blood sugar wil rise again, for the sugar is stil not able to enter the cel . Chromium is

available in many natural foods (especial y whole grains), but most of it is removed when

foods are refined. The average American diet is lacking in chromium. At birth we have a

good supply of chromium, but as we get older we gradual y lose it if we do not eat

properly. Many older individuals are deficient in chromium. Why is this happening? When

refined sugar is eaten, it requires chromium to be utilized. If none is taken in with food,

chromium from the body stores, if available, has to be used. Thus chromium is gradual y

depleted and sickness occurs.



What about fresh fruits, as they contain sugar? Fresh fruits of al kinds are excel ent

for the diabetic.(1) The sugar in fresh fruit is fructose sugar and is very different from the

refined table sugar (which is sucrose sugar). When we eat sugar or starch our body

breaks it down into simple sugar and the blood then carries it to the cel s of the body. For

this simple sugar to enter the cel s it needs insulin and chromium, but if you have eaten

only fructose sugar (the good kind that is found only in fresh fruits), no insulin is needed

for the sugar to enter the cel s. This is why a diabetic can eat al the fresh fruit desired, but

no canned or frozen fruit juices (even if they are supposedly al natural). Al of these are

refined; they have been heated (even the frozen ones) and are hard for a diabetic to

assimilate.

Use no free fats - only natural fats as found in avocados, nuts, etc. Recent studies

show excess fat intake can decrease the number of receptors and/or deactivate them.

This results in the gradual build up of sugar in the bloodstream. Dr. James Anderson, one

of the most respected authorities on diabetes in the world, did a study with Dr. Kiehm.

They took thirteen diabetics off the 34 percent fat, 23 percent protein diet prescribed by

the American Diabetes Association and fed them a 9 percent fat diet of mostly natural high



100

fiber, starchy foods. Blood sugar levels were significantly lowered in al thirteen. Al five

patients taking oral drugs and four of the eight patients taking insulin were able to

discontinue their medication completely. (2)



Diabetics should discontinue the use of baking powder or soda, as these decrease

the activity of the pancreatic juices, which are used in the body to digest protein, fats and

carbohydrates. The pancreas is one of the most important organs of digestion.



Fasting is usual y not advisable for diabetics. Avoid al mental nervous stresses and

strains. Avoid constipation; the bowels must be kept loose with at least three good

eliminations every day. This is imperative to improved health.





Herb Tea - Tea, made from any one of the fol owing herbs is beneficial: raspberry

leaves, red root or dandelion root. Mix one tsp. of herb per 8 oz. of distil ed water. Let

steep for 20 minutes or longer. Drink three cups daily.





Exercise - Exercise wil lower the blood sugar and enable the diabetic to require

less insulin.(3) Deep breathing and lots of exercise of hard physical labor wil help keep the

fire of the metabolic processes burning fast, and this wil diminish the need for insulin.



Sunlight - The effect of direct sunlight on the body's sugar metabolism paral els

that of insulin. Sunlight facilitates the absorption of glucose into the cel s of the body and

stimulates the body to convert its blood sugar (glucose) into stored sugar (glycogen).(4)

This is minimal in a normal individual but dramatic in diabetics. A diabetic must gradual y

expose his body to the sunlight. Diabetics who choose to sunbathe should always keep in

touch with their physician as their insulin dosage wil have to be decreased.

In conclusion, diabetes is unknown in countries where people can't afford to

overeat. Americans may be the richest people in the world, but they are also one of the

sickest. In America, a new diabetic is discovered every 50 seconds. I want to encourage

al to eat in moderation, only those things that are wholesome and natural.

ELECTRICAL CURRENTS





Our body runs on electricity. An electrocardiogram wil record the electrical activity

of the heart. An electroencephalograph records the electrical activity of the brain. Today

we know the human body runs on electrical energy.

Very few health professionals have any information on the electrical currents in the

body and how they can be altered to either produce good or bad results in the human

body.



WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?

No one real y knows what electricity is. We only partial y know how to use it and

how it works. This definition of electricity is given in Taber's Cyclopedic Medica Dictionary;

"A form of energy that exhibits magnetic, chemical, mechanical and thermal effects.

Electricity is formed from the interactions of positive and negative charges." The medical

field today uses electricity on the body. Three examples of this are found in electro

hemostasis, which uses high frequency current to stop bleeding; electroconvulsive

therapy, the use of electrical shock to produce convulsions; and electro analygesia, using

low intensity electrical currents to bring relief from pain. These forms of electrical

treatments may cause harm to the body, as they disturb the natural circulation of electrical

currents. Did you know that cancer cel s are weaker than normal cel s, and that cancer

cel s have a different electrical frequency than normal cel s?



NATURAL WAYS OF KEEPING THE BODYâ€™S ELECTRICAL CURRENTS

IN BALANCE



I'm sure, as research in this area goes on, more natural ways to keep the body's

electrical currents in balance wil be found. Two natural ways that I'm aware of are

breathing fresh outside air, and having the body in contact with the soil.





102





BREATHING FRESH AIR



Al air contains electricity. Air can be either positively charged or negatively charged.

Negatively charged air, which is the kind that is beneficial to us, is found in the open air,

especial y in the mountains or the country; these are examples of air

that has been undisturbed by pol ution. The air with the most negative

ions in it is ocean air, or the air near a river or waterfal , and the air just

after a rainstorm. Positively charged air is not beneficial to us and is

the air found inside a closed room. Al electrical appliances and

heating and air conditioning systems use up good negative ions and

give off bad positive ions. This is especial y true of TV's, computers,

microwaves and fluorescent lights. The air we exhale is also positively

charged.



As the number of positive ions increases, with a corresponding

decrease in negative ions, one may feel such adverse effects as headaches, nasal

obstruction, hoarseness, fatigue, dry throat and dizziness. Negatively charged air, on the

other hand, produces a feeling of exhilaration and wel -being. Negatively charged air also

has been shown to decrease the respiration rate and lower blood pressure, while

positively charged air has just the opposite effect. (1)



There are over 3,000 - 4,000 negative ions in one cubic centimeter of mountain air,

but only 100 negative ions in one cubic centimeter of air in an office building at the end of

an eight hour day. Thus, we can readily see that to keep our body's electrical currents high

in negative ions, and thus experience good health, we need a continuous supply of fresh

outdoor air. "The stomach, liver, lungs and brain are suffering for the want of deep, ful

inspirations of air, which would electrify the blood and impart to it a bright, lively color, and

which alone can keep it pure, giving tone and vigor to every part of the living machinery".

(2)



BODY CONTACT WITH THE SOIL



To help keep our body's electrical frequency correct, we should spend some time

outside each day working with the soil or standing (or walking) with our bare feet in direct

contact with the earth. Our body and the earth are both electrical; and you do not get an

electrical exchange with the earth when you are wearing shoes, as the soles insulate you

from the ground. Just a short time, (10 minutes min.) each day wil greatly benefit a

person. This exercise is especial y true for those who are nervous or emotional y

disturbed.



CONCLUSION



The more knowledge man acquires the more he realizes how little he actual y

knows. We stil have much to learn about the electrical currents that control the human

body. This is an area that has been sadly neglected in the health field and I hope that as

time goes on we wil understand more ful y the good and bad effects of electricity on the

body.

ELIMINATION





This is a subject that everyone talks about and usual y suffer bad experiences

about sooner or later in life. Over 80 mil ion Americans suffer from bowel problems.

Cancer is the second major cause of death in the United States and of al cancer deaths,

cancer of the colon ranks second only to lung cancer.



Toxic bowel waste matter within our body is a big factor in diseases of al types. A

person who eats 3 meals a day should have three bowel movements a day. If a person

eats two meals a day, then they should have two bowel movements a day. One should

eliminate the residue of each meal 15 to 18 hours after eating. When a person goes two or

more days without an elimination, al that waste is putrefying in the body and being

reabsorbed through the colon wal s. The body is thus being poisoned from within. It would

be the same as keeping some food in a covered garbage can for two days in a

temperature slightly above 98.6 degrees,



CAUSES





The major causes of constipation are poor diet, inadequate intake of water, lack of

physical exercise, emotional or mental distress, and the use of medications. Low Fiber

Diet - Most foods that are eaten today are highly refined and lacking in fiber and bulk.

Good health and regular eliminations depend on a lot of fiber. Unrefined grains, nuts,

legumes, fruits and vegetables are high in fiber.



All types of cheeses are the most constipating foods one can eat.



Fiber should be cal ed the staff of life. When people change from a soft diet (which

are foods lacking in fiber and bulk), to wholesome natural unrefined foods that take time to

chew, it is amazing how much better they feel in a short period of time. They themselves

are amazed at how much more stamina and strength they have. Fewer people would

experience constipation, if they would eat more foods containing fiber. Processed,

devitalized foods are lacking in fiber and bulk. They tend to be dry, sticky and pasty. They

have a tendency to stick to the insides of the colon like glue and are difficult to eliminate.

Dr. J. N. Morris states that a lack of fiber in the diet may be one of the major causes of

coronary thrombosis (blockage of the coronary arteries). (1)

Both British and South African medical scientists strongly insist that insufficient

numbers of bowel movements and too little fiber and bulk in the feces may often explain

the existence of gal bladder disorder, heart problems, varicose veins, appendicitis, clotting

in deep veins, hiatal hernia, diverticulosis, arthritis and cancer of the colon. This complete

turnaround in medical orientation comes from professional and respected surgeons and

biochemists.(2)

After a tremendous amount of research work done by the Senate Select Committee

on Nutrition and Human Needs, the fol owing conclusion was reported. They

recommended a 25 percent reduction in the consumption of fat, and a 25 percent increase

in carbohydrates (particularly in the form of whole grains, fruits and vegetables). the



104

committee cited the relationship between the current fat rich, fiber deficient American diet,

and the high risk of cancer as wel as heart ailments and other diseases.



Water - One should drink a minimum of two quarts of distil ed water daily. If you are

overweight or doing hard physical work then you need more than 2 quarts. When we do

not drink enough water our body wil absorb water from the fecal matter that is in our

colon. This in turn makes the fecal matter hard, which causes constipation. Our bodies

use much more water than we realize. Each day we lose one and one half glasses of

water, through breathing alone. Over a quart a day is lost in urine; and every time we blink

our eyes, our body loses some water. Of course, our body loses large amounts of water

through perspiration.

Exercise - Exercise wil help one to have regular eliminations. You have six

hundred thirty three muscles, every one of which needs to be used. If we do not use our

muscles, they lose their tone, strength and flexibility. Exercise doesn't have to be painful.

There are hundreds of ways to exercise the human body. The exercise having the most

benefit is walking and no special equipment is required, except a good pair of shoes.

Stress - Do you remember a time when you were enjoying a good meal with

friends and you received a phone cal giving you terrible news? You suddenly lost your

appetite and you even felt light headed and sick. The relation that exists between the

mind, and the body is very intimate. When one is affected the other sympathizes. Stress

today is one of the causes of poor digestion, ulcers and constipation. Grief, anxiety,

discontent, remorse, guilt, distrust, or other emotions, al tend to break down the life

forces. Isaiah 26:3 gives us the answer to this problem.

Medications - Medications can cause many problems with the bowel. The side

effects of many medications cause constipation for many physiological reasons.

Antibiotics, such as penicil in and sulfa can completely eliminate the favorable intestinal

flora, leaving the opportunity for reinfestation by harmful bacteria and viruses.

Laxatives - Laxatives are irritating to the bowel and are dangerous. Today there

are more than 45,000 laxative and cathartic medications being manufactured and used in

America. These substances, in order to evacuate the colon, are essential y poisons and

irritants. The poisoned intestinal tract tries to evacuate the offending substance as quickly

as possible and pushes everything out. Often times, these harsh poisonous substances

are absorbed through the lymph and blood vessels and find their way to al parts of the

body affecting the liver, kidneys, and other vital areas. Many of these medications can

become addicting, and can destroy the ability of the bowel to eliminate natural y.



HERBS

Herbs can be used successful y and safely for constipation. One of the best herbs

for constipation is Cascara Sagrada. Mix four teaspoonfuls in a quart of distil ed water

(that was boiling and just taken off the stove). Let it steep for one hour, then drink one or

two cupfuls one hour before meals or on an empty stomach.

To get wel and stay wel , our bodies have to be clean on the inside as wel as the

outside. If you wil eat natural unrefined foods, drink plenty of pure water, gets proper

exercise, stay away from medications, and al ow God to handle the stress in your life, you

should not have any problems with proper elimination.

FASTING



Fasting is the oldest therapeutic method known to man. Even before the advent of

the healing arts, man instinctively stopped eating when feeling il and abstained from food

until his health was restored. Perhaps he learned this from animals, which always fast

when not feeling wel

There is much said throughout the entire Bible about fasting. God instituted fasting

for both spiritual and physical blessings. Fasting has two purposes - the up building of the

body and the spiritual up building of the soul. As fasting improves physical health, it also

improves mental health causing the mind to be open to a greater extent to the leading and

impressions of the Holy Spirit.

I am thoroughly convinced that a great many people eat too much (over 60% of al

Americans are overweight). Many eat food that does not give them proper nourishment;

they eat food that is highly refined and unwholesome. This food wil gradual y, over a

period of time, bring upon them sickness and death.

Many scientific studies are now being made around the world, particularly in Europe, to

determine the therapeutic effects of fasting. The Karalinska Institute in Stockholm, a world

famous medical research institution, has made clinical studies of fasting under Drs. P.

Reizenstein and J. Kel berg. These studies demonstrated that fasting has a definite

beneficial healing effect.



WATER FAST VS. JUICE FAST VS. FRUIT & VEGETABLE FAST

There are persons who advocate long fasts for health, but I discourage long water

fasts as they can be quite harmful to the body. However, a prolonged fresh fruit and

vegetable fast I highly recommend. Proper fasting can do a lot in helping with one's health;

but improper fasting can be harmful to one's health. A normal person can fast one to three

days on only distil ed water without any injury and it wil be quite beneficial both spiritual y

and physical y to one's health. If you fast on water only for more than three days, then you

are living on the broken down tissues in your body which produces an acid reaction. This

thickens the blood; and with a high concentration of poisons in the bloodstream, puts a

burden on the heart, arteries, kidneys, liver, lungs, etc.

We can help this cleansing process by eating lots of fresh raw vegetables and fruits

as most are alkaline forming and wil increase the healing effect of fasting as elimination of

uric acid and other inorganic acids wil be accelerated. The vitamins, minerals, enzymes

and trace elements of raw vegetables and fruits are important in supplying needed

elements for the body's own healing.

Fasting in Europe is practiced on a grand scale. There are hundreds of clinics in

Germany alone where fasting is a number one method of healing. Al of them use juice

fasting exclusively. I believe that juice fasting is preferable to water fasting, but that the

whole fruit or vegetable fast is preferable to a juice fast. Which is more natural, the orange

or orange juice? He would have put a lid on top of the orange. When you use juice

instead of the whole food, while you are fasting, you wil have problems with elimination as

there is no fiber or bulk in juice.

FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLESS: FAST CLEANSES THE BODY

It is wel to know the process your body goes through in the course of a fast. The

first three days are usual y the most difficult in terms of hunger pains. By the fourth day the

hunger pains are beginning to subside, though you wil have feelings of weakness and

occasional dizziness. During a prolonged fast (after the first three days) your body wil live

on its own substance. When it is deprived of needed nutrition such as proteins and fats, it

wil burn and digest its own tissues. But your body wil not do it indiscriminately -and here

lies the secret of the effectiveness of fasting -your body wil first decompose and burn

those cel s and tissues which are diseased, damaged, aged, or dead.



In fasting, your body feeds itself on the most impure and inferior materials such as

tumors, abscesses, fat deposits, etc. Dr. Otto Buchanan, M.D. (one of the greatest fasting

authorities in the world) cal s fasting -very pertinently - a "refuse disposal", a "burning of

rubbish". During fasting, while the old cel s and diseased tissues are decomposed and

burned, the building of new healthy cel s is speeded up. This eliminative process is

evidenced by some of the fol owing typical symptoms: offensive breath, dark urine, skin

eruptions, excessive perspiration, catarrhal eliminations of mucus, and headaches. Do not

be disturbed by those symptoms; rather, be grateful for the increased health and wel -

being that wil result.

By the ninth or tenth day of a longer fast, the body wil normal y have eliminated the

bulk of toxic poisons and you wil start feeling great. Your sense of concentration wil be

greater, and you wil feel as if you could continue fasting indefinitely as you are not

hungry. Your fast can last as long as you like (it could go on for weeks as it depends upon

how much fresh fruit and vegetables you are eating), but it must end when your hunger

pains return. This is the signal that the body has used up al its excess reserves. The fast

should be broken at this time.





ADDITIONAL TIPS ON FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLE FAST

Do not drink with meals, and do not mix fruits and vegetables at the same meal. Eat

only fresh fruits and vegetables, nothing cooked or dried. Eat no more than twice a day at

a regular time each day, and nothing between meals, except water or herb tea. One must

drink a minimum of two quarts of distil ed water daily; more is better. Bathing once or twice

daily is also beneficial, as one third of al body impurities and wastes are eliminated

through the skin. Do lots of deep breathing of outside air. Red clover tea is a very good

herb to take while one is on a fast. It is an excel ent blood purifier and wil help your body

detoxify. Drink it as often as you like.

FEVERS





The normal temperature taken oral y is 98.6Â° F.

However, it may be within the range of normal if it is one

degree above or two degrees below this value. When an

individual comes down with a fever, their body is trying to tel

them something is wrong.



Fever happens to be a defense strategy employed by

the body that helps to destroy bacteria and viruses that have

gotten out of hand. Bacteria and viral microbes live normal y

and natural y inside of human beings. They co-exist with us,

around us and inside us, and when our body's immune

system is working properly, these microbes cause us little

concern. In fact, many scientists have demonstrated that
