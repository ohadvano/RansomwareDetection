FOREWORDS



As a health professional, I am excited about the information that Dr. Hoover shares

in this book. The health field is flooding with new information about health, much of it

being very risky and dangerous. This information ranges from new drugs and high-tech

surgery to the effectiveness of simple natural treatments that people can do at home. This

can be a very confusing time for people. How can a person differentiate between fact and

fiction with so much information to examine? I believe the answer to that important

question can be found in this book. People need to have the facts. If they understand the

basic laws of health, then by reasoning from cause to effect they wil be able to wisely

determine the best health care answer for their health problems.



These facts are time tested and apply to al people al the time. They are the laws

that govern the human body. These laws cannot be broken without consequence and

cannot be kept without benefit.



In my practice, I have observed in working with hundreds of patients that those who

fol ow these laws of health get wel much more quickly and hold their adjustments much

better than those who donâ€™t.



Dr. Hooverâ€™s years of experience in teaching and applying these laws of health has

made him very effective in sharing them with others. His straightforward style, using

laymanâ€™s terminology, makes the facts exciting to read as wel as clear and logical. Those

who read this information wil have a real advantage in todayâ€™s health jungle. Not only wil

they be armed with the facts, but they also wil enjoy better health as they fol ow the

simple truths that they learn.

â€œThe wil to winâ€ is more important than â€œthe skil to winâ€ We are al designed to win;

and in order to win we must focus on Whatâ€™s Important Now. In my years as a

Naturopathic Physician and a Florida State Licensed Nutritional Counselor, I feel Whatâ€™s

Important Now is that we make health our first concern and not our last resort; most of us

give up on our health in quest for wealth, just to spend the wealth to regain our health. Dr.

Jerry Hooverâ€™s monumental piece of work, â€œNatural Medicineâ€, has laid out the simple

truths of taking care of this miracle machine we cal the human body.



I feel this book wil satiate your quest for zest ultimately adding cheers to your

years. We are al healthy by design and sick by default. If you invest in yourself, youâ€™l

never make a bad investment and the interest just keeps growing and growing with no

service charge!



As an international Speaker and Mentor to thousands, books about health come

across my desk al the time asking for my opinion and approval; and I am glad to see one

such as Dr. Hooverâ€™s pass the testâ€¦ straightforward answers to keep us happy, healthy

and in control!

PREFACE


Naturopathy is a therapeutic system that does not use drugs or therapy, but

employs natural forces such as light, air, water, etc. â€œNatureâ€ means â€œnot artificial, but

lifelike.â€ â€œPathyâ€ means â€œhealing crises.â€ So, a true Doctor of Naturopathy wil not use

anything artificial to cure il ness. But wil al ow the body to heal itself by using natural

methods. Thus: A Naturopathic Doctor is a Doctor of Natural Healing.



When a naturalist sees a person suffering from disease caused by improper eating,

drinking and other wrong health habits, yet neglects to tel him of this, he is doing his

fel ow being an injury. We are complex beings, functioning on physical, mental and

spiritual levels. The factors most strongly influencing our health are the eight natural

remedies of Fresh Air, Pure Water, Sunshine, Natural Food, Rest, Exercise, Temperance

and Trust in God.



I have been a health advocate for over 35 years. I can stil remember back on New

Yearâ€™s Eve, 1969, when I made a resolution to become a vegetarian and since then I have

continued learning how to use effectively the natural means for healing.



The writing of this book was the best way I could acquaint you with the many

natural ways to better health. I see many for whom no drug or surgery wil restore health.

In spite of many scientific advances, we stil remain humbly, pitiful y, dependent upon the

natural forces of nature to bring about the abundant health that many of my clients have

experienced.

Healthy Lifestyle





The fol owing story is taken from â€œHealthful Livingâ€/1986 and reprinted here by kind

permission of the author:



â€œCatherine Cress, 75, glides through the water with scarcely a ripple. She could be

demonstrating the perfect breast stroke to a swimming classâ€¦



â€œShe can swim faster than anyone else in the country her age. She can swim faster

than most people far younger.â€



So wrote Pamela Livingston, staff writer for the Roswel Daily Record, Roswel ,

New Mexico, in the July 1, 1985, edition.



At 5â€™2â€ and 95 pounds, Catherine Cress is the fastest 75-79 year old breast stroke

swimmer in the United States.



In Milwaukee in the spring of 1985, she broke al the records of any previous

winners of 75 â€“ 79 year olds for the 50 yards, the 100 yards and the 200 yard breast

stroke. She has received al kinds of medals for swimming, recently and when she was a

15 to 20 year old girl.

How does Catherine Cress, now age 76, stay in shape to swim extraordinarily in

these meets? For the past 18 years, sheâ€™s been swimming one mile four to five mornings

a week. She says: â€œI never miss because I never get sick. For 25 years I havenâ€™t been to a



8

doctor.â€ Says Catherine: â€œI am 76 years young and so happy my body functions so

perfectly. Everyone I know my age and younger, al suffer from one thing or another and

take al kind of drugs.â€



Whatâ€™s Her Secret?





Catherine Cress has no secrets! Ask her and sheâ€™l tel you why sheâ€™s healthier than

her peers and most younger people. Sheâ€™l tel you why sheâ€™s in better shape than her

mother was at the same age. Not only does Mrs. Cress stay fit with regular exercise, but

â€œI gave up meat 15 years ago. I never eat sugar. Most of the time, I eat raw fruits and

vegetables and seeds and nuts.



â€œI belong to a food co-op and buy my fruits ad nuts there. People gobble up al

those vitamins. They ask me which ones I take. I say â€˜NOTHING!â€™â€.



To prove how healthy she is, Catherine told me: â€œLast night I slipped in water and

fel in the garage. I got up and wasnâ€™t even hurt. My bones must be strong.â€



For further proof of her unusual health, Mrs. Cress told me: â€œMy son is an oral

surgeon in Chicago. When he checks me, my blood pressure is always normal and my

temperature is only 97.2 degrees.



â€œIâ€™ve worn glasses since Iâ€™ve been 53 or 55. My family said, â€˜Get new glassesâ€™. I

said, â€˜I can stil see fine with these.â€™ I just want to stay healthy just as long as Iâ€™m living.â€

Introduction


When we mention living healthful y, many people groan. They immediately think of

tasteless food, rigid exercises, regimentation and unhappiness. This is not true; and this

book has been written to prove to you that true happiness is feeling good about yourself

because you are in control of what is happening to you.



Everybody wants to be happy, healthy and free from the threat of il ness and

disease. Every day countless numbers die from the dreaded cancer or from Aids, from

heart disease or from some other serious il ness. Al of these il nesses can be traced to

one source: failure to maintain a healthy immune system.



We al have within our bodies a certain number of germs, but the body has an

immune system to protect us from these germs. As long as our immune system is strong,

these germs cannot develop into ful blown, life-threatening diseases. However, if we do

not strengthen our immune system or if we weaken it by engaging in bad health habits,

then the disease germs multiply and we suffer. The secret to a healthy life then is to learn

how to strengthen and maintain a healthy immune system.



Many people visit our Center where we teach them how to strengthen their immune

system by eating properly, exercising and abstaining from putting harmful things in the

body system. Dozens of these clients have left us happier, healthier and free from

disease.



Margie is a classic example of what a healthful lifestyle can do to improve your

quality of life. She had suffered a toxemia pregnancy early in her marriage, leaving her

with chronic hypertension, which eventual y developed into a heart disease.



When she came to me, she was 30 pounds overweight and suffering from

congenital heart failure. She had a rapid pulse, dangerously high cholesterol and had

been taking blood pressure medication for over 30 years.



We immediately began her on a program of natural foods, exercise, daily walking

program and pure water. When she read in the Physicianâ€™s Desk Reference about the

side effects of the medications she was on, she decided to stop taking them.



During the 26-day program, Margie entered enthusiastical y into al activities; she

learned about how to take better care of her body and how to prepare delicious and

nutritious meals in a more healthful way. Every day she attended health classes to learn

how her body functions and what is required to maintain health. These are the same

health tips your wil learn in this book.



At the end of the program, she was 15 lbs. lighter, more energetic and happier

about her newly found lifestyle. One year later she was stil feeling good, maintaining a

healthy blood pressure, had a low pulse rate and has reached her target weight of 145 lbs.

She has also learned how to deal with the stresses in her life that was affecting her heart

condition.



â€œGod answered my prayers,â€ she said, â€œwhen He al owed me to learn about the

proper diet and lifestyle that al should fol ow if they plan to live in the New Earth.â€



In this book, I wil share these same health principles with you. There is no secret

magic formula, but fol owing these health principles produces miraculous results. If you

are underweight or overweight, suffering from some disease known or unknown, the

health principles outlined within the pages of this book can revolutionize your life.

PART I




Part I of this book takes a close look at

the Eight Natural Remedies that we can

all use and take advantage of to

maintain and improve our health. These

Eight Natural Remedies are Fresh Air,

Pure Water, Sunshine, Natural Food,

Rest, Exercise, Temperance and Trust in

God.



14





FRESH AIR





Air is an invisible, tasteless, odorless mixture of gases surrounding the earth. Air at

sea level is composed of 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, 1% water vapor, carbon dioxide and

traces of ammonia, argon, helium, and other rare gases. Experiments have shown that

death wil occur from prolonged inhalation of air, in which the proportion of oxygen is much

greater than that in which it natural y occurs in the atmosphere. Therefore, we know that

the mixture cal ed air is not an accidental compound, but one perfectly adapted by our

Creator to the needs of the human body.

The first need of al living creatures on this earth is oxygen. They can not live

without it. Oxygen must always be present in the air we breathe. Al of the tril ions of cel s

in the human body must receive a constant supply of oxygen or those cel s wil weaken

and die. Through the tissue fluids the cel obtains the oxygen it needs and gives up the

carbon dioxide it does not need. This transportation of oxygen from the outside air to the

tissue cel s, and the carrying away of carbon dioxide is done through our lungs.

Our lungs are light and spongy in texture. If placed in water, they wil float. Normal y we

breathe about fifteen times a minute, inhaling about a pint of air each time we take a

breath. The lungs normal y hold about six pints of air, so that about one sixth of the air is

exchanged each time we take a breath. A person sleeping uses only about 10% of his

lung capacity. Hard work increases lung use to about 50%. The singer or woodwind player

uses his lungs almost to the ful est extent possible. (1)



AIR IS ELECTRICALLY CHARGED

Air contains electricity. The air we breathe affects the body as if it

were charged with electricity. This electrical energy, absorbed by the

blood, is carried to al parts of the body. The air we breathe contains

both negatively charged ions and positively charged ions. Our bodies

need a larger portion of the negatively charged ions for optimum

health. As we breathe large quantities of positively charged ions (the

bad kind), we may feel such adverse effects as headache, nasal

obstruction, hoarseness, fatigue, dry throat, dizziness, etc. Breathing

mostly negatively charged air (the good kind) wil produce feelings of exhilaration and wel -



15





being. Negatively charged air has been shown to decrease the respiration rate and lower

blood pressure, while positively charged air does just the opposite. One group of

researchers reported that patients who had high blood pressure and breathed negatively

charged air had an average drop of 39mmHg in systolic blood pressure. (2)

Negatively charged air (the good kind) is found in abundance at the ocean, in the

mountains, at the foot of a waterfal or by a river or stream. Al outside air has a large

amount of negative ions. This is why we feel so good when we go camping or to the

ocean. Or, if one is fatigued, a short walk outside in the fresh air wil liven up the whole

body. There are over 3-4 thousand negative ions in one cubic centimeter of mountain air,

but only 100 negative ions in one cubic centimeter of air in an office building at the end of

an eight hour day. Enclosed buildings have mostly positively charged ions which are

harmful to health. Al electrical appliances, air conditioning units, etc. use up the good

negative ions and give off positive ions. Al the air we exhale is positively charged; that's

why a person gets drowsy after sitting for a long time in a closed room that is ful of

people.

The Lungs Give Off Positively Charged Poisonous Gases



Both food and oxygen are taken by the blood to the cel s

and are there converted into heat and energy by a process

similar to combustion. When common fuel is burned, a by-

product is formed, a gas or smoke which is deadly and must be

removed. In like manner, the burning of food and oxygen in the

body cel s produce a positively charged carbonic acid gas

which is taken by lymph and blood to the lungs to be exhaled,

thus, saving the body from harm. If this elimination should

cease for a few minutes, life would cease. About thirty quarts of this positively charged

carbonic acid gas are exhaled per hour by one person. About one third of the body

wastes, which are poisons, go out from the lungs. We should always so arrange our

ventilation that those wastes wil quickly go out-of-doors rather than accumulate in the

room, thus enabling the lungs to always have a good supply of fresh, clean, negatively

charged air.

Our skin also needs pure fresh air. The skin has mil ions of minute openings known as

pores. One of the functions of these pores is to breathe in the fresh air. If we covered the

skin of a person with a material like paint and closed these pores up, the person would

suffocate in a short time.

Dr. Kel ogg, an authority in natural medicine, who stressed

adequate ventilation in homes, offices, and school rooms, estimates that

each person requires at least 3000 cubic feet of fresh air per hour to

dilute the poisons poured forth from his own lungs and skin. He tel s us

that any system of ventilation is inadequate which does not supply this

amount of air to each occupant of a dwel ing. Sick rooms and hospitals

require two or three times as much air as this on account of the

increased amount of contamination.



An old army surgeon who had charge of large hospitals during the

war related a very interesting experience il ustrating the importance of giving the sick,

especial y persons suffering with fever, and abundance of pure air. He said that in a large

hospital he had at one time 320 cases of measles during the winter season. The hospital

caught fire and burned to the ground and the patients had to be placed in tents. Al but

one or two recovered. He said he had no doubt but that the number of deaths would have

been thirty or forty at least, had the patients remained in the hospital.



16



One would never think of eating food some other person had chewed, yet we donâ€™t

realize how breathing enclosed, foul air over and over again wil poison the blood stream

and injure the lungs. To enjoy good health our homes should have plenty of ventilation

(windows opened winter and summer). With our modern, sealed homes and air

conditioning units re-circulating a large percentage of the impure indoor air, we are

starving our lungs of pure, fresh air. The oxygen the body obtains from the air is very

important in maintaining good health. Without the abundance of pure fresh air, the

important work of normalizing the blood chemistry could not be successful y performed

and the individual would suffer serious consequences.



â€œScientific evidence shows that the indoor air can be more seriously pol uted than

whatâ€™s out of the window, even in the largest and most industrial cities,â€ says Dave Ryan,

an air pol ution expert and spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in

FRESH AIR CRISES IN BUILDINGS

In the 1970's around the time of the energy crisis and the resulting trend toward

conservation, many of the buildings built, were to be so-cal ed energy efficient. New

homes and offices were built with fewer windows. Sealing buildings to make them energy

efficient became the norm, leaving occupants dependent on mechanical systems rather

than open windows for fresh negatively charged outside air and ventilation.

In large office buildings the problems are much worse. One Environmental

Protection Agency study of indoor air quality in various public buildings found a typical air

sample contained 100 to 200 different chemicals at levels that were much higher indoors

than outside. Some of those chemicals were paints, adhesives, caulking, vinyl, telephone

cables, printed documents, furniture, various solvents, formaldehyde, etc. Many

dangerous biological agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungal spores, algae, pol en, mold,

etc. are also found. These biological agents can cause many al ergic reactions.

Legionnaire's Disease and severe respiratory problems are also caused from these

biological agents. By inhaling this impure air, the blood is poisoned, the lungs become

affected, and the whole system is diseased.

A clear connection between poor building ventilation and disease was made in a

four-year study published in 1988, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in

Washington D. C tracked the respiratory health of recruits at four separate army training

centers. The study was notable because the subjects were a highly control ed group. They

were drawn randomly from al over the country; they al received identical immunizations

during processing; the soldiers in one barracks tended not to have contact with those in

another; and at each camp the soldiers did the same activities outdoors, under the same

conditions. Indoors, however, some subjects lived in energy-efficient barracks; and some
