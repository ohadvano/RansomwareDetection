CHAPTER ONE

After several months of preparation, now came Kiran’s time to prove his worth. Dressed in a red tunic adorned in golden swirls on the hems, and grey trousers beneath, he carefully crept through the lush bushes in search of his target. Apart from a compact, metal cannon in a bronze frame, Kiran had a knapsack on his back with his various necessities inside, along with a staff he placed through a strap on his bag.
Most of the sunlight was hidden by the thickness of the jungle’s trees, and Kiran had to rely on the effectiveness of his eyes. The parts of the soil present had a sandy tone and texture, however Kiran was more focused on following the footprints of his prey. He occasionally looked up to see his surroundings, knowing he was not the only one out here on the hunt.
Focus, Kiran, he thought. This is your only chance.
Kiran, at sixteen years old, needed to obtain a special ingredient in order to start preparing the spells for the tournament, and that vital ingredient he needed, was right before him nibbling on a few fallen mangos.
Among all the beasts on the continent of Aardel, bosdrakes were one of the rarest. They were few in numbers, and said to only lay ten eggs every twenty years. Some said it was a curse from the gods as a means of curving the rise in numbers of the powerful creatures, but the bosdrakes never were the type to tell.
The typical bosdrake was ten meters tall from head to toe, with a thick tail half its height, capable of levelling small trees in one swing. But the one before Kiran was around five feet tall, fairly young. It had yellow skin and a stocky build, it’s thick arms and legs ending in four digits with large talons. It had a large head with a blunt snout, and its eyes were bright green and its mouth wide. The bosdrake had two rows of orange studs on its head that ran all the way down to its tail that coiled against its back, with green hair set in a drooping mohawk—unlike Kiran’s hair was braided into ten individual locks. This bosdrake in particular also wore a necklace of red and copper stones and square wood carvings.
Besides the smoothness of its jaw and the eyelashes, Kiran could tell it was a female by its exposed genitals; a plump labia with dark lips and round breasts. The sight of it caused blood to rush down Kiran’s groin, and he had to briefly pause and wait till his thoughts settled.
The bosdrake hummed a sweet tune as she sat on her bottom beneath the tree, entertaining her eyes with the swaying branches as she ate.
Now’s my chance! Kiran thought. He lifted his cannon and looked along the iron sight. Kiran made sure he had the bosdrake’s head in view, and pulled the trigger. The hammer struck, and the cannon bucked with a flash of smoke from the muzzle, releasing a ball the shape and size of a chicken egg.
But to Kiran’s horror, the bosdrake ducked, and the projectile struck a tree and exploded into a cloud of brown smoke. It was a concoction of chemicals with enough strength to knockout a fully-grown wildebeest.
“Oh no!” said Kiran as he punched the spent shell out of the side of the cannon. At the base of it was a cartridge that held four rounds, one of which he just wasted.
The bosdrake laughed mockingly as she got up and faced Kiran. The intensity of her glare caused him to flinch. “Amateur human!” she said. “You disguised your footsteps, but I smelt you coming a mile away. Hold your weapon!”
Kiran was about to point the weapon at her but he froze. That was when the bosdrake said, “Who are you? And what do you want with me?”
