
Use a juicer if you can. They are awesome. I use the left over fiber to bake healthy muffins and cookies for others.

If youâ€™re eating a salad try lemon, lime or fresh orange juice or sprinkle on some no-sodium herb blends for added flavor.

I kept cooking too much vegetable stews, 12 bean soups, etc. So I prepared enough for the family to share and for the next dayâ€™s lunch.

Lightly grill some vegetables for a change up in taste.

I love â€˜baby carrotsâ€™. OK, they are just peeled and cut carrots, but they are good. If you are lucky enough to find some real baby carrots eat them. They contain more nutrients.

Sprouted seeds provide the most energy.

The Kimâ€™s Greens I used at first tasted like grass. So I put them in my fruit-smoothie in the morning. The pH balance greens I tried the 2nd time taste better.

Grilled Portobello mushrooms have a texture much like meat. When I made them with spices for the family or put them in a stew, nobody knew it wasnâ€™t meat. I made one as a steak sandwich for someone and they didnâ€™t know.

Frozen vegetables are a quick meal and have more nutrients than fresh because they donâ€™t lose nutrients to the air on the way to market.

Diabetics should monitor blood glucose levels and reduce insulin shots or oral medications accordingly. Consult your medical provider.

Magic Bullet mixers, George Forman Grills and Juicers, are awesome tools to use on any healthy diet. If you need to purchase any of the items you can buy them online at

Amazon.com, Buy.com and other retailers.
