Terry waves at me but doesn't look away from the schedule, â€œI'll lock up the front but could you do me a favor before you leave, dear?â€
Before I could respond to say anything, Terry gathers six plastic bags full of trash, and drops them at my feet.
â€œYou want me to take these out to the dumpster?â€ I ask as I gather all six bags, three in each hand, and look up at Terry.
â€œPlease, I would really appreciate it.â€ He grabs his jacket, waves, and leaves.
I stare at the swinging door dumbfounded and shake my head.
With the bags still in my hands, I leave through the back and walk towards the dumpster. I scoff when I see that it's pouring down with rain.
Great. Thanks, Terry. Thanks a bunch.
I push open the top of the dumpster, and grab the first two bags to throw in when from the darkness behind me, I hear the faint unmistakable sound of growling. I freeze, wondering if that was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Terrified, I clutch the bags close and turn around, holding the bags as one would a sword, ready to strike out. I turn, and as I open my eyes, I see the source of the growling, as standing not two meters away is the largest wolf I've ever seen.
I whimper in fright, and slowly start to retreat backwards, dropping my makeshift weapon as I go. I feel my back touch the dumpster, and realize there's nowhere for me to go. Shaking in fear, I close my eyes, praying the wolf doesn't see me as a threat or worse, a meal.
â€œPlease don't hurt me.â€ I whisper repeatedly to myself. I open my eyes and wish that I hadn't.
Its eyes will haunt me for as long as I live. The eyes were blood-red, filled with pure hatred towards me. A dull shade of gray covers its whole body with big chunks of its fur missing, like it had been ripped off. The wolf looked as though it had scars everywhere on its body. How had it managed to survive this long?
I do the only thing I can think of. I kneel down on the wet floor with my head bowed down in the hope it's a sign of submission. The wolf howls into the night and lunges for me. I scream as it tackles me but soon runs into the bushes and out of sight. I look in the direction the wolf ran and start laughing hysterically.
What the fuck	?
I shake my head and pick myself off the floor, my uniform completely ruined. I check myself over, and that's when I notice on my right shoulder that my clothing's been torn apart.
Why does my shoulder hurt so much?
It looked as though something had taken a chunk out of my shirt.
â€œOuch!â€ I wince, and as I touch my shoulder, I see red liquid coating the skin on my hand.
Blood! Did it bite me!?
I look around, trying to figure out whether that really happened.
Shaken, I chuck the last few bags in the dumpster, grab my bag, lock up and head home.
As I walk home in the dark, the rain no longer pouring, I look up into the night sky, and notice the full moon.
Chapter 2

When I arrive at school the next morning, all I can think about is last night. I woke up early to check if it actually happened, and knew that it did when I saw the bite marks. As a result, I couldn't sleep. At all. Sleeping on my right side hurt too much, and school was by far the last place I wanted to be.
I walk to my locker, grab my English book, and that's when I hear my best friend calling my name from the other end of the corridor.
â€œAlice! Did you watch Game of Thrones last night!?â€ One thing about Sam is that she doesn't give a damn about what anyone thinks of her. Me? I worry way too much about what people think.
When Sam reaches my locker, she places her hands on her hips and tilts her head for an answer I have yet to give. â€œSo, did you watch it?â€
I shake my head, â€œNo... I missed it.â€
â€œYou what!? How did you miss it!? You do realize it was the finale right!â€' She shrieks hysterically at me.
â€œSam.â€ I use my hand to signal her to lower her voice. â€œEveryone's staring.â€
â€œYou think I care about what people think?â€
She didn't give me a chance to answer. Instead, she turns around and faces all the onlookers. â€œDidn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to stare? My mum always tells me to never stare at anybody because if you do, some people might not be as nice as I'm going to be.â€
She turns around and shrugs at me when she sees the pure shock on my face. â€œI told you, I don't give a damn about what people think.â€
I look inside my bag to see if I have everything only to realize that I don't have my pencil case. I reopen my locker when I hear Sam sigh.
â€œPeople still staring?â€
â€œWhat? Oh, no just Ryder and his crew. They walk around here like they own the place, but seriously how does a guy even look that good?â€
After I grab my pencil case, I shut my locker and look at my best friend, whose mouth is wide open.
â€œSam! You're staring honey, and drooling.â€ I close her mouth, shove the pencil case in my bag and stare at them. Every single person moves to the side to make room for them to pass. You see, this gang does practically own the school, and if you hurt one of them, you hurt them all.
Everyone knows who they are and no one dares to try and talk to them or to even approach them. They walk side by side in a perfect line. Bane and Silver on the outside, with Kellan and Ryder in the middle.
Bane looks to be the most frightening one out of them all. He has an oval shaped face with small, blue piercing eyes. His mouth, full and firm with a constant sneer on his face. He has tanned skin with a warm, golden brown tint that accentuates his large muscular frame. His hair was thick, black and slicked down with both sides of his head shaved. Bane also had a black bushy beard decorating his face. It was hard sometimes to take him seriously with the beard because it kind of makes him look like a big old teddy bear, but if the rumors were true, you definitely shouldn't say that to his face, not unless you wanted to end up in A&E. He wears a plain white wife-beater that's low enough to show the hairs on his chest, and a long black necklace rests on his chest that looks like a triskelion. He wears black tight jeans with black ankle boots with a small heel.
I look over at Silver who walks on the far right corner and just blatantly stare at her. Every girl wants to be her, and every guy in this school wants to date her, but everyone knows that she's in love with Ryder. The way she looks and smiles at him with her perfect teeth and her perfect body. She has a heart-shaped face with pale, smooth skin and bright blue eyes. Her mouth is full and perfectly shaped which helps accentuates her pouty lips. Her long wild, black untamed hair rests on her left shoulder and hangs down by her waist. Her build small but muscular.
Rumours say that she kicked a jocks ass once after he slapped her ass. He left in an ambulance, and didn't return to school until the next month. No one ever touched her again. Not after that. She wears a black leather jacket that cuts to her waist, plain black shorts, and black thigh high boots.
The kindest looking one out of them all is Kellan. It seems kinda odd to see him with these people. He has an oval shaped face with creamy fair skin, dark brown eyes that look haunted but yet gentle at the same time. His face holds no expression which makes it hard to determine whether he's happy or sad. Curly brown hair frames his perfectly shaped face. He wears a black stretcher in his left ear with both of his arms covered in colourful art. His body slim with no ounce of body fat, just pure muscle. He wears a plain black wife - beater, tight black jeans and black sneakers. Kellan just might be the only approachable one out of them all. He has this kind aura about him that draws people in, and it makes it impossible to dislike him. I remember when he and his girlfriend were together. Anna was one of the sweetest girls in this school, and every single person here respected her and treated her with the utmost kindness, but Kellan lost the love of his life over a year ago. Her body was found by the river near the creek in the early hours of the morning.
People say that the crime scene was like something out of a horror film. Nevertheless, Kellan lost a part of himself after losing Anna, and I didn't blame him.
â€œWhat makes her so special? I bet she has like a magic vagina or something plus, she's probably slept with all three of them.â€
I look away from Kellan just as he passes by us, and gasp at my best friend. â€œSam, stop staring before she beats you up as well as you ending up in the hospital!â€
â€œWhat? It's not like she can hear me.â€
I grab Sam's hand and drag her down the corridor towards our English class. We take our seats near the front row, take out the reading book and wait for Mr Daniels. â€œHonestly, I guarantee you that she's sleeping with one of them.â€ Sam points with the tip of her pen to the back of the class without looking back. I look over my shoulder towards the back and see the four of them sitting together, but neither of them speak to each other. Silver sits beside Ryder as always. She always remains by his side.
I look over at Ryder, his expression remaining impassive as Silver strokes his arm compassionately. Anyone could tell just by looking at her that she's in awe of him. Kellan on the other hand, remains silent and sits with his elbows on the table, his head resting between them. Bane sits with his legs crossed on top of the table with his hands resting behind his head. He looks around the room like he's observing everything around him. Only then did it hit me. â€œSam!â€ I hit her hand as I'm turning around and accidentally knock the pen out of her hand.
â€œThat's my favourite pen.â€ She points down towards the floor. â€œIt never hurt anybody.â€
â€œAre they even supposed to be in this class? Why am I only realizing this now?â€ I motion towards the back and tilt my head to the back of the room.
â€œIt's the middle of senior year so...no. The school doesn't let people change course in the middle of the year but I don't know. Maybe they worked something out with Mr Daniels?â€
She picks up her pen and inspects the damage â€œYou owe me a new pen by the way. This fountain pen was a gift I got on my birthday.â€
â€œYeah, sure.â€ I look towards the back of the class again, only to realize that they're all staring back at me. They really were intimidating.
Silver tilts her head to the side and stares at me with a hateful glare, while Bane's jaw ticks.
I knit my brows and look towards Kellan. He smiles a small smile, his eyes crinkle at the sides when I smile back at him. He only smiles for a second, then looks down at his desk again. I move my head completely to face Ryder, and for the first time in years, I really take a good look at him.
He has a chiselled shaped face with tanned spotless skin. Emerald green eyes that keep you staring, but his eyes hold no threat nor hatred, just a pure curious stare. I look at him as he stares back at me to see him smirking. His lips are full, yet firm.
I bet he's kissed a lot of girls with those lips...
After adjusting his beanie, he slicks his shiny black hair to the side and sticks his tongue out at me. I knit my brows in confusion again, and turn around, â€œAsshole.â€
As I face the front of the class all I hear is Ryder laughing from the back.
Shit! Can he lip-read!?
â€œWho's the asshole?â€ Sam looks around the room to find the culprit but only finds me staring at her.
She points to herself in panic. â€œIf this is about the pen don't worry about it.â€
â€œNo it's nothing. I'm just not up for work tonight.â€ I pick up the book and skim over the blurb.
â€œBehind on homework? I can help you at the diner tonight if you want?'
â€œThanks, but I'm sure I'll be able to catch up on time.â€
I pull out a pen from my pencil case just as the door to the classroom opens.
Is Mr. Daniels off sick today?
â€œGood morning students, my name is Mr Edmund, and I will be your English teacher for the rest of the school semester. I believe you are reading the novel Wuthering Heights. Can anyone volunteer to start us off?â€
He writes his name on the whiteboard as Oliver Edmund. â€œWhere's Mr. Daniels?â€
â€œI'm not obliged to share that information with you, Ms. Frey.â€
He turns around, and stares at Sam with his cold demeanour.
â€œSir? We were promised to have our test results back today.â€
This practice test was everything I needed to pass for next weeks exam. If I'm going to fail another class, I'm not sure I'm going to survive the rest of senior year.
â€œAlice, isn't it?â€
He walks down the aisle holding the clipboard that holds everyone's name, and tilts his head to the side.
â€œThat is correct, yes.â€ I say with a calm, and collected voice.
â€œAlways raise your hand if you have a question.â€
He does a once over on me, then walks to the front of the class, and points to the board.
â€œI'm your teacher now. Whatever Mr Daniels taught you before, forget about it because he's not coming back.â€
He claps his hands together and looks at me. â€œNow Alice, why don't you start reading for us. Chapter 8, I presume?â€ He sits down in the chair, and motions with his hand for me start reading.
Where are you, Mr. Daniels?
Chapter 3

At six o'clock, I work my way towards the back of the diner to the office, where Robbie sits behind his desk on the phone.
â€œYes, love. Of course, I'll make sure to buy the right one this time, alright love you too. Bye.â€
He looks at me with his toothless grin. â€œAlice, how are you?â€
â€œI'm good, thank you, but I just wanted to ask you if there's an extra uniform here somewhere?â€
â€œWhat happened to the uniform you have?â€
He stands from the old wooden chair, and looks in the cardboard boxes that are placed at the back of the office.
â€œI spilt some coffee on the shirt, and the stain won't come off.â€
I can't lie for shit, but he seems to be buying it.
He sits back down just as he hands me a new uniform, â€œBe careful this time, alright? I mean, I know you like your coffee, but if it happens again, I'm going to have to ask you to pay for it.â€
I take the uniform from him, â€œThank you, Robbie, and this time I promise to be more careful.â€
I walk rapidly towards the bathroom, lock the door and look at myself in the mirror. I had a heart-shaped face with rosy coloured cheekbones. My never-ending white blonde hair is always kept in a braid down my back. Ivory skin with bright pale blue eyes; like the clear sky. My mother tells me that my eyes are like the colour of diamonds, eyes that are so pale they could appear as white. My teeth are perfectly straight and white after years of my mother lecturing me about how to look after them. My nose is a little on the prominent side, but you can blame my father for that. Thankfully, that's the only thing I have of him.
I've never known my father, nor will I ever want to know him.
After a few moments I sigh, close my eyes and rest my hands on either side of the sink.
Just get it over and done with!
I open my eyes and take off my shirt swiftly, and look over my shoulder to look at the bite.
â€œWhat the hell...?â€
I look in the mirror to see nothing but pure smooth skin, â€œWhere is it...?â€
Not a single bite mark was to be seen.
I didn't understand. It happened just hours ago and yet it's gone?
After changing into my uniform, I walk out of the bathroom and place myself behind the counter, but I couldn't concentrate on doing anything. Questions kept interrupting my thoughts, but I couldn't answer either of them. Maybe it healed overnight?
I peel my shirt over my right shoulder and check again. Nothing.
â€œChrist, Alice, you trying to give these people a strip tease or something?â€
I roll my eyes when I hear her voice. I look towards the front of the diner to see Sam walking towards me with her school bag draped over her shoulder. She takes out her laptop and today's homework, and sits directly in front of me on our new red diner stools.
â€œI'll have a strawberry milkshake and a few fries please.â€ She types away on her laptop as I prepare the milkshake.
I walk to the kitchen to see Terry preparing the food for the waiting customers.
â€œAnother order of fries on its own but it's Sam, so take your time, okayâ€' I do a thumbs up but he doesn't see it, or he's probably ignoring it.
As I walk back into the diner, I realize it's not as busy as I thought it would be.
â€œAlice, the milkshake's kinda overflowing.â€ Sam says nonchalantly.
â€œShit!â€
I rush to the milkshake machine, clean up the mess and pass it over the counter.
â€œThank you kindly.â€ Sam takes a sip of the milkshake, sighs in delight and puts away the laptop.
â€œSo, what do you think of our new English teacher? Hot right?â€ She winks at me. â€œI mean, I would.â€
â€œSam! He's like forty years old!â€ I hit her with the dishcloth that I keep on my shoulder.
â€œAge is just a number!â€
All the patrons in the diner stop talking, turn in their chairs and stare at the two of us as we laugh over Sam's infatuation with our new teacher. I apologize immediately to them for our adolescent behaviour.
â€œSam seriously, he's old enough to be your father.â€ I clean the counter to look busy when the diner door opens.
Almost immediately, I notice everything falling silent.
I glance over to see why the place has gone quiet, only to see four tall frames at the diner's entrance.Why were they here? They looked so out of place.
Bane walks with confidence towards the closest patron, leaving the other three standing guard at the door. He leans down to one of the regulars and speaks to him. I didn't know how I could hear him, but I heard every single word.
â€œYou might wanna stop staring at us before I tear you apart piece by piece big man.â€
â€œHey!â€ I rush from behind the counter, stand directly in front of him only to be met with a broad chest.
â€œI don't care who you are, but I won't have you talking to the regulars like that.â€
At this point, Ryder stands by Bane's side, never taking his eyes away from me.
â€œAre you saying we aren't welcome here because we're not regulars?â€ Bane looks at me with pure disgust written on his face.
â€œOf course, you're welcome here, but if you're going to disrespect the regulars then I'm going to have to ask you to leave.â€
I say this with as much confidence as I can muster, but with Ryder standing with his eyes on me the whole time, I'm really quite surprised I haven't shat myself.
â€œWe aren't here to start trouble. We just came to have some food in this highly recommended diner that you have here.â€ Ryder's voice fills the whole diner. While he speaks, I can't help but stand there looking into his bright green eyes.
â€œWell, as long as you don't start trouble, take a seat, and I'll grab you some menus.â€ I say.
Neither of us takes our eyes away from each other, but the connection is broken too quickly when I hear Sam's voice calling me.
â€œAlice! Where the hell are my goddamn fries!?â€
I turn around to see Sam giving me the grumpiest look ever known to mankind.
Without looking at Ryder, I excuse myself and walk behind the counter, my hands shake as I grab four menus and four pairs of cutlery. I glance up again to see Ryder sitting in one of the booths with his friends, but his eyes remain on me.
â€œI'm known for being a patient person, but please give me my fries!â€
â€œI told Terry to take his time, so whenever Terry's ready to make your fries, he'll make them.â€
I walk past the counter, and laugh when I hear Sam confronting Terry in the kitchen.
While that's happening, I stand at the edge of the table and hand Ryder all the menus.
â€œI'll be back in a few minutes to take your order. Kitchen closes at seven thirty.â€ I hurry back to the cashier, when I notice Sam sitting back in her seat, with a few fries on a plate.
â€œThose aren't yours, are they?â€ I point towards the fries on the plate just as I hear Terry yelling from the kitchen.
â€œNope, but they're mine now.â€ She grabs for another fry just as her elbow knocks the milkshake over, and that's when everything happens in slow motion.
Time slows down as I see the milkshake descend to the floor. I feel this uncontrollable urge to catch it before it falls. With the time slowing down, it gives me enough time to catch it, just inches before it spills everywhere. I look at the milkshake resting in my hand and check around me to see if anyone noticed, but I'm only met with four curious sets of eyes.
â€œNice reflexes you got there Alice.â€
Sam doesn't seem as freaked out like I am right now. Instead, she picks up another fry just as I slam down the milkshake on the counter, to which it topples over.
My breath hitches, â€œYou didn't see that?â€
â€œSee what? You rescuing my delicious milkshake that is now spilling everywhere on this counter?â€
â€œSam, honestly, I'm freaking out right now!â€ â€œAre you okay? Want me to call your mum?â€
â€œNo, I just. I need to tell you something about what happened here last night.â€ I whisper to her over the counter in the hope that nobody hears me.
â€œWhat's going on with you today? And why are you whispering? No one's looking at us.â€
â€œThey're watching.â€ I answer.
Sam remains looking at them until she turns around and tells me that they're leaving.
â€œWhat's the problem? What happened last night?â€
I take a steady breath, and replay the events of last night. â€œI was working here last night until closing hour. Terry and I were the only ones left at the diner. He asked me to take the trash out to the dumpster and I heard a growl from behind me. It was so quiet I thought I didn't hear anything, but I turned around and saw the biggest wolf I've ever seen, and I've never seen a wolf that big before in Small Town.â€
Sam rolls her eyes. â€œI mean we see wolves all the time, we live in Small Town for gods sakes! We're gonna see wolves running around and for one being here, it was probably drawn to the smell of rotting food or something.â€
Sam grabs her schoolbag from the floor, and starts packing her things.
â€œSam, I'm telling you, it was huge! It bit me right on the shoulder and ran away!â€
Sam stops packing her thing, and looks at me with pure worry on her face.
â€œIt bit you? Did you tell your mum to look at it?â€
I shake my head knowing she's about to have an outburst. â€œNo.â€
â€œWhy the hell not!? She's a nurse! God knows what that thing carries.â€
â€œThere wasn't any point in telling her because by the time I went to bed the cuts were all sealed closed, and the marks were completely gone when I changed for work.â€
I show her my shoulder to find it still the same. No bite marks.
â€œWhy didn't you say anything in school?â€
â€œI didn't think it really mattered when I woke up this morning and only saw a few cuts there.â€ A pause.
â€œI wish I knew what to tell you or at least give you advice but...â€
Sam remains calm and collected, but I know that on the inside she worries too.
â€œYour milkshake would have been on the floor if I hadn't moved to grab it in time. I'm telling you now, everything in this room moved in slow motion like the time was slowing down for me to catch it before it leaked on the floor. And then hearing Bane whispering to Paul to stop staring or he'd tear him apart. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he's sitting right by the door and I'm all the way back here! Something's wrong with me!â€
I turn around to face the coffee machine and pour myself a large cup of coffee.
Sam speaks to me in a quiet and comforting tone, she probably knows that I'm close to losing my mind.
â€œThis all happened after it bit you?â€
â€œYeah, and it scares me to even think about what could happen to me. What if I actually turn into one?â€ I turn around with my mug of coffee and sit next to her.
Sam scoffs, â€œYou're my best friend, and whatever happens just know that I'll be there for you. Even if you don't want my help, you shouldn't go through this alone. So, if you do turn into a big scary wolf, which is impossible by the way, I promise not to tell anyone. The last thing I want is you chasing me on a full moon.â€
Sam stays with me till the end of the shift but leaves shortly when her mother comes to take her home. Sally offers to take me home, but I politely decline because I've got to lock up the diner.
I take out the trash, brush and mop the floor, then change out of my uniform. I lock up the back and exit through the front.
I double check that the door is locked when I hear rustling coming from behind me. I shrug it off blaming the wind, but when I hear it again I can't help but think it's the wolf from last night. I stay rooted to the ground in absolute fright when I hear laughter coming from behind me.
I turn around a little too quickly, and fall forwards on the floor.
â€œI didn't know for sure, but I had to check to see if I was right and now that I know, I was right about you.â€
I look up into Ryder's cold, distrusting green eyes.
I stand with unsteady legs, and shiver when my back connects with the diner's cold, damp door, â€œWhat are you talking about?â€
Ryder, Bane and Silver create a half circle around me. Ryder was standing in front of me while the other two stands on either side.
Kellan remains a little further behind Ryder, showing no signs of joining this little confrontation.
Silver steps forward, grabs my braid and pulls my head back hard. She leans forward right into my jugular and inhales. â€œShe's new, but she's changing fast. I wouldn't be surprised if she changes tonight if she survives that is.â€
She shoves my head forward and stands back.
It's Bane's turn to step forward. He stands in front of me, shielding Ryder from view. Bane reaches out with his giant-sized hand and wraps his hand around my delicate throat. â€œLet's get one thing clear here. I don't like you nor will I ever like you. I don't trust easily when it comes to people like you. His scent is all over you, and it's taking every ounce of control I have not to kill you.â€
â€œKill me?â€ I stutter.
â€œI promise you, if you get in my way and humiliate me again as you did in there, I'll kill you myself.â€
I reach with both of my hands to stop Bane from strangling me. His figure goes all blurry, when suddenly his hand disappears from my throat. I fall to the ground like a rag doll on all fours, and start gasping for air.
I hear them arguing above me, but I can't make out a single word.
I look up with blurry eyes to see Kellan standing in front of me in a protective stance.
â€œHe was killing her and you weren't gonna do shit about it! She's got nothing to do with the murders here!â€
Ryder's head tilts to the side as he listens to Kellan, â€œYou don't know that. Anyway, leave us. I need to have a little conversation with Alice. Alone.â€
Both Silver and Bane snicker like hyenas as they run into the middle of the road.
â€œKellan, leave. I'm not going to hurt her.â€
Ryder kneels down in front of me and cups my cheek gently.
As Kellan walks away, he turns around and looks at Ryder with warm, sorrowful eyes. â€œShe's no threat to us.â€
â€œGo home, Kellan!â€
By the time I can stand on my own two feet, Kellan's already out of sight.
Chapter 4

The last thing I wanted do right now is to have a conversation with Ryder. I'd rather stick pins in my eyes and cut out my tongue than speak to him. But here we are, in the middle of the night.
â€œLook, I'm really tired and a little pissed off with you and your friends. So just say what you got to say and leave me alone.â€
Hopefully, he'll never have to speak to me again. â€œWhat happened to you last night?â€
I should have moved when I had the chance because right now, my boobs are getting to know his chest really well.
â€œAbsolutely nothing. And anyway, it's not like I owe you an explanation.â€
Ryder cages me in with both of his hands on either side of my head. â€œYou think I didn't see you inside that diner? We all did! So I need to know what happened to you last night.â€
â€œWhy is it so important for you to know?â€ I duck underneath his arm, and start walking.
â€œAlice! You need to listen to me.â€
Before I know it, Ryder grabs my wrist and turns me around to face him. â€œYou may not believe me, but I'm trying to help you.â€ â€œHelp me!?â€
â€œI'm trying to help you understand what you're about to go through.â€
â€œAnd what would that be?â€ I take my hand from his hold, and place my hands on my hips in expectation of his answer.
â€œYou might think I'm joking, but trust me I'm not.â€ Ryder turns his back on me, places his hands in his pockets and sighs in defeat. â€œIn a few days, you'll go through the change.â€
I frown. â€œThe change?â€
â€œVery soon, you'll experience the change. The change of becoming a wolf.â€
A what?
I look at him in confusion, then burst out laughing.
He turns around and looks at me, his nostrils flaring â€œStop laughing. This is not a joke. I don't joke about things like this. By the look of things, it's going to happen pretty soon.â€
Surely he doesn't mean that I'm actually going to turn into a wolf because that's just crazy.
I roll my eyes, â€œOkay, I'll play along. What happens during this change?â€
â€œPain. A lot of pain.â€

The chart above was gathered from a number of sources. There is a difference between what is alkalizing and what is acidifying depending on source, as various methods are used to determine this. Some researchers use the alkaline content of a food; others try to determine the effect on the body â€“ citrus fruit on the surface appears to be acidic for example, but has a neutralizing affect when consumed; other researchers have come up with a number, as in the chart above, in which they use mineral content to determine the rating.

Use your good judgment on determining which acidic foods to eat. For instance, Salmon, tuna and even sardines provide Omega fatty acids which are important to health. Donâ€™t cut these out of your diet because of the acidifying ratings. Use reason. I eat hamburgers and other meats because I like them, but I donâ€™t do it every day or in large quantities. I want to keep my pancreas healthy.

About pH: pH is recorded on a level from 0 to 14, with 0 to 6.9 being acidic, 7 neutral and 7.1 to 14 alkaline. The human body should be around 7.35 to 7.5 for optimal health. When we eat foods, the pancreas works to turn the digested particles alkaline as they enter the blood stream. It takes 750,000 times the effort to turn a soda with a pH 2 to a pH 7.5 as it does to change a pH 7 food to pH 7.5. Each level takes 10 times the effort.

The regulars are kind and generous with their tips, and even my boss Robbie isn't so bad. He's a little on the lazy side and stares a little too long at my backside, but he always pays on time and lets me take any leftover food home with me.
I look up at the old round clock hung up on the wall and sigh in contempt.
Only half an hour to go.
I stare at the last customer of the night and pray silently that he's close to finishing. I grab the coffee pot, walk with a forced smile and approach the customer.
â€œMore coffee, sir?â€ I plead with my eyes in the hope that he would say no.
â€œNo, thank you, my dear.â€ He says as he stands from the table.
I help him put on his coat and grab his umbrella. He hands me a ten-pound note and walks out the door without a word. I put the money in the till and turn off the lights in the diner.
Afterwards, I head towards the back of the diner where the kitchen is, and realize it's only me and Terry left. He's looking at the schedule hanging up on the office wall with a look of dread on his face. Terry sighs loudly when he looks at the dates he's working. Terry's worked at the diner for over thirty years and not once has he had a day off. His hair is starting to gray, but he can cook the most delicious food I've ever had the pleasure of tasting.
â€œHey Terry, the last customer just left. Do you want me to lock up the diner for you?â€
Terry waves at me but doesn't look away from the schedule, â€œI'll lock up the front but could you do me a favor before you leave, dear?â€
Before I could respond to say anything, Terry gathers six plastic bags full of trash, and drops them at my feet.
â€œYou want me to take these out to the dumpster?â€ I ask as I gather all six bags, three in each hand, and look up at Terry.
â€œPlease, I would really appreciate it.â€ He grabs his jacket, waves, and leaves.
I stare at the swinging door dumbfounded and shake my head.
With the bags still in my hands, I leave through the back and walk towards the dumpster. I scoff when I see that it's pouring down with rain.
Great. Thanks, Terry. Thanks a bunch.
I push open the top of the dumpster, and grab the first two bags to throw in when from the darkness behind me, I hear the faint unmistakable sound of growling. I freeze, wondering if that was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Terrified, I clutch the bags close and turn around, holding the bags as one would a sword, ready to strike out. I turn, and as I open my eyes, I see the source of the growling, as standing not two meters away is the largest wolf I've ever seen.
I whimper in fright, and slowly start to retreat backwards, dropping my makeshift weapon as I go. I feel my back touch the dumpster, and realize there's nowhere for me to go. Shaking in fear, I close my eyes, praying the wolf doesn't see me as a threat or worse, a meal.
â€œPlease don't hurt me.â€ I whisper repeatedly to myself. I open my eyes and wish that I hadn't.
Its eyes will haunt me for as long as I live. The eyes were blood-red, filled with pure hatred towards me. A dull shade of gray covers its whole body with big chunks of its fur missing, like it had been ripped off. The wolf looked as though it had scars everywhere on its body. How had it managed to survive this long?
I do the only thing I can think of. I kneel down on the wet floor with my head bowed down in the hope it's a sign of submission. The wolf howls into the night and lunges for me. I scream as it tackles me but soon runs into the bushes and out of sight. I look in the direction the wolf ran and start laughing hysterically.
What the fuck	?
I shake my head and pick myself off the floor, my uniform completely ruined. I check myself over, and that's when I notice on my right shoulder that my clothing's been torn apart.
Why does my shoulder hurt so much?
It looked as though something had taken a chunk out of my shirt.
â€œOuch!â€ I wince, and as I touch my shoulder, I see red liquid coating the skin on my hand.
Blood! Did it bite me!?
I look around, trying to figure out whether that really happened.
Shaken, I chuck the last few bags in the dumpster, grab my bag, lock up and head home.
As I walk home in the dark, the rain no longer pouring, I look up into the night sky, and notice the full moon.
Chapter 2

When I arrive at school the next morning, all I can think about is last night. I woke up early to check if it actually happened, and knew that it did when I saw the bite marks. As a result, I couldn't sleep. At all. Sleeping on my right side hurt too much, and school was by far the last place I wanted to be.
I walk to my locker, grab my English book, and that's when I hear my best friend calling my name from the other end of the corridor.
â€œAlice! Did you watch Game of Thrones last night!?â€ One thing about Sam is that she doesn't give a damn about what anyone thinks of her. Me? I worry way too much about what people think.
When Sam reaches my locker, she places her hands on her hips and tilts her head for an answer I have yet to give. â€œSo, did you watch it?â€
I shake my head, â€œNo... I missed it.â€
â€œYou what!? How did you miss it!? You do realize it was the finale right!â€' She shrieks hysterically at me.
â€œSam.â€ I use my hand to signal her to lower her voice. â€œEveryone's staring.â€
â€œYou think I care about what people think?â€
She didn't give me a chance to answer. Instead, she turns around and faces all the onlookers. â€œDidn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to stare? My mum always tells me to never stare at anybody because if you do, some people might not be as nice as I'm going to be.â€
She turns around and shrugs at me when she sees the pure shock on my face. â€œI told you, I don't give a damn about what people think.â€
I look inside my bag to see if I have everything only to realize that I don't have my pencil case. I reopen my locker when I hear Sam sigh.
â€œPeople still staring?â€
â€œWhat? Oh, no just Ryder and his crew. They walk around here like they own the place, but seriously how does a guy even look that good?â€
After I grab my pencil case, I shut my locker and look at my best friend, whose mouth is wide open.
â€œSam! You're staring honey, and drooling.â€ I close her mouth, shove the pencil case in my bag and stare at them. Every single person moves to the side to make room for them to pass. You see, this gang does practically own the school, and if you hurt one of them, you hurt them all.
Everyone knows who they are and no one dares to try and talk to them or to even approach them. They walk side by side in a perfect line. Bane and Silver on the outside, with Kellan and Ryder in the middle.
Bane looks to be the most frightening one out of them all. He has an oval shaped face with small, blue piercing eyes. His mouth, full and firm with a constant sneer on his face. He has tanned skin with a warm, golden brown tint that accentuates his large muscular frame. His hair was thick, black and slicked down with both sides of his head shaved. Bane also had a black bushy beard decorating his face. It was hard sometimes to take him seriously with the beard because it kind of makes him look like a big old teddy bear, but if the rumors were true, you definitely shouldn't say that to his face, not unless you wanted to end up in A&E. He wears a plain white wife-beater that's low enough to show the hairs on his chest, and a long black necklace rests on his chest that looks like a triskelion. He wears black tight jeans with black ankle boots with a small heel.
I look over at Silver who walks on the far right corner and just blatantly stare at her. Every girl wants to be her, and every guy in this school wants to date her, but everyone knows that she's in love with Ryder. The way she looks and smiles at him with her perfect teeth and her perfect body. She has a heart-shaped face with pale, smooth skin and bright blue eyes. Her mouth is full and perfectly shaped which helps accentuates her pouty lips. Her long wild, black untamed hair rests on her left shoulder and hangs down by her waist. Her build small but muscular.
Rumours say that she kicked a jocks ass once after he slapped her ass. He left in an ambulance, and didn't return to school until the next month. No one ever touched her again. Not after that. She wears a black leather jacket that cuts to her waist, plain black shorts, and black thigh high boots.
The kindest looking one out of them all is Kellan. It seems kinda odd to see him with these people. He has an oval shaped face with creamy fair skin, dark brown eyes that look haunted but yet gentle at the same time. His face holds no expression which makes it hard to determine whether he's happy or sad. Curly brown hair frames his perfectly shaped face. He wears a black stretcher in his left ear with both of his arms covered in colourful art. His body slim with no ounce of body fat, just pure muscle. He wears a plain black wife - beater, tight black jeans and black sneakers. Kellan just might be the only approachable one out of them all. He has this kind aura about him that draws people in, and it makes it impossible to dislike him. I remember when he and his girlfriend were together. Anna was one of the sweetest girls in this school, and every single person here respected her and treated her with the utmost kindness, but Kellan lost the love of his life over a year ago. Her body was found by the river near the creek in the early hours of the morning.
People say that the crime scene was like something out of a horror film. Nevertheless, Kellan lost a part of himself after losing Anna, and I didn't blame him.
â€œWhat makes her so special? I bet she has like a magic vagina or something plus, she's probably slept with all three of them.â€
I look away from Kellan just as he passes by us, and gasp at my best friend. â€œSam, stop staring before she beats you up as well as you ending up in the hospital!â€
â€œWhat? It's not like she can hear me.â€
I grab Sam's hand and drag her down the corridor towards our English class. We take our seats near the front row, take out the reading book and wait for Mr Daniels. â€œHonestly, I guarantee you that she's sleeping with one of them.â€ Sam points with the tip of her pen to the back of the class without looking back. I look over my shoulder towards the back and see the four of them sitting together, but neither of them speak to each other. Silver sits beside Ryder as always. She always remains by his side.
I look over at Ryder, his expression remaining impassive as Silver strokes his arm compassionately. Anyone could tell just by looking at her that she's in awe of him. Kellan on the other hand, remains silent and sits with his elbows on the table, his head resting between them. Bane sits with his legs crossed on top of the table with his hands resting behind his head. He looks around the room like he's observing everything around him. Only then did it hit me. â€œSam!â€ I hit her hand as I'm turning around and accidentally knock the pen out of her hand.
â€œThat's my favourite pen.â€ She points down towards the floor. â€œIt never hurt anybody.â€
â€œAre they even supposed to be in this class? Why am I only realizing this now?â€ I motion towards the back and tilt my head to the back of the room.
â€œIt's the middle of senior year so...no. The school doesn't let people change course in the middle of the year but I don't know. Maybe they worked something out with Mr Daniels?â€
She picks up her pen and inspects the damage â€œYou owe me a new pen by the way. This fountain pen was a gift I got on my birthday.â€
â€œYeah, sure.â€ I look towards the back of the class again, only to realize that they're all staring back at me. They really were intimidating.
Silver tilts her head to the side and stares at me with a hateful glare, while Bane's jaw ticks.
I knit my brows and look towards Kellan. He smiles a small smile, his eyes crinkle at the sides when I smile back at him. He only smiles for a second, then looks down at his desk again. I move my head completely to face Ryder, and for the first time in years, I really take a good look at him.
He has a chiselled shaped face with tanned spotless skin. Emerald green eyes that keep you staring, but his eyes hold no threat nor hatred, just a pure curious stare. I look at him as he stares back at me to see him smirking. His lips are full, yet firm.
I bet he's kissed a lot of girls with those lips...
After adjusting his beanie, he slicks his shiny black hair to the side and sticks his tongue out at me. I knit my brows in confusion again, and turn around, â€œAsshole.â€
As I face the front of the class all I hear is Ryder laughing from the back.
Shit! Can he lip-read!?
â€œWho's the asshole?â€ Sam looks around the room to find the culprit but only finds me staring at her.
She points to herself in panic. â€œIf this is about the pen don't worry about it.â€
â€œNo it's nothing. I'm just not up for work tonight.â€ I pick up the book and skim over the blurb.
â€œBehind on homework? I can help you at the diner tonight if you want?'
â€œThanks, but I'm sure I'll be able to catch up on time.â€
I pull out a pen from my pencil case just as the door to the classroom opens.
Is Mr. Daniels off sick today?
â€œGood morning students, my name is Mr Edmund, and I will be your English teacher for the rest of the school semester. I believe you are reading the novel Wuthering Heights. Can anyone volunteer to start us off?â€
He writes his name on the whiteboard as Oliver Edmund. â€œWhere's Mr. Daniels?â€
â€œI'm not obliged to share that information with you, Ms. Frey.â€
He turns around, and stares at Sam with his cold demeanour.
â€œSir? We were promised to have our test results back today.â€
This practice test was everything I needed to pass for next weeks exam. If I'm going to fail another class, I'm not sure I'm going to survive the rest of senior year.
â€œAlice, isn't it?â€
He walks down the aisle holding the clipboard that holds everyone's name, and tilts his head to the side.
â€œThat is correct, yes.â€ I say with a calm, and collected voice.
â€œAlways raise your hand if you have a question.â€
He does a once over on me, then walks to the front of the class, and points to the board.
â€œI'm your teacher now. Whatever Mr Daniels taught you before, forget about it because he's not coming back.â€
He claps his hands together and looks at me. â€œNow Alice, why don't you start reading for us. Chapter 8, I presume?â€ He sits down in the chair, and motions with his hand for me start reading.
Where are you, Mr. Daniels?
Chapter 3

At six o'clock, I work my way towards the back of the diner to the office, where Robbie sits behind his desk on the phone.
â€œYes, love. Of course, I'll make sure to buy the right one this time, alright love you too. Bye.â€
He looks at me with his toothless grin. â€œAlice, how are you?â€
â€œI'm good, thank you, but I just wanted to ask you if there's an extra uniform here somewhere?â€
â€œWhat happened to the uniform you have?â€
He stands from the old wooden chair, and looks in the cardboard boxes that are placed at the back of the office.
â€œI spilt some coffee on the shirt, and the stain won't come off.â€
I can't lie for shit, but he seems to be buying it.
He sits back down just as he hands me a new uniform, â€œBe careful this time, alright? I mean, I know you like your coffee, but if it happens again, I'm going to have to ask you to pay for it.â€
I take the uniform from him, â€œThank you, Robbie, and this time I promise to be more careful.â€
I walk rapidly towards the bathroom, lock the door and look at myself in the mirror. I had a heart-shaped face with rosy coloured cheekbones. My never-ending white blonde hair is always kept in a braid down my back. Ivory skin with bright pale blue eyes; like the clear sky. My mother tells me that my eyes are like the colour of diamonds, eyes that are so pale they could appear as white. My teeth are perfectly straight and white after years of my mother lecturing me about how to look after them. My nose is a little on the prominent side, but you can blame my father for that. Thankfully, that's the only thing I have of him.
I've never known my father, nor will I ever want to know him.
After a few moments I sigh, close my eyes and rest my hands on either side of the sink.
Just get it over and done with!
I open my eyes and take off my shirt swiftly, and look over my shoulder to look at the bite.
â€œWhat the hell...?â€
I look in the mirror to see nothing but pure smooth skin, â€œWhere is it...?â€
Not a single bite mark was to be seen.
I didn't understand. It happened just hours ago and yet it's gone?
After changing into my uniform, I walk out of the bathroom and place myself behind the counter, but I couldn't concentrate on doing anything. Questions kept interrupting my thoughts, but I couldn't answer either of them. Maybe it healed overnight?
I peel my shirt over my right shoulder and check again. Nothing.
â€œChrist, Alice, you trying to give these people a strip tease or something?â€
I roll my eyes when I hear her voice. I look towards the front of the diner to see Sam walking towards me with her school bag draped over her shoulder. She takes out her laptop and today's homework, and sits directly in front of me on our new red diner stools.
â€œI'll have a strawberry milkshake and a few fries please.â€ She types away on her laptop as I prepare the milkshake.
I walk to the kitchen to see Terry preparing the food for the waiting customers.
â€œAnother order of fries on its own but it's Sam, so take your time, okayâ€' I do a thumbs up but he doesn't see it, or he's probably ignoring it.
As I walk back into the diner, I realize it's not as busy as I thought it would be.
â€œAlice, the milkshake's kinda overflowing.â€ Sam says nonchalantly.
â€œShit!â€
I rush to the milkshake machine, clean up the mess and pass it over the counter.
â€œThank you kindly.â€ Sam takes a sip of the milkshake, sighs in delight and puts away the laptop.
â€œSo, what do you think of our new English teacher? Hot right?â€ She winks at me. â€œI mean, I would.â€
â€œSam! He's like forty years old!â€ I hit her with the dishcloth that I keep on my shoulder.
â€œAge is just a number!â€
All the patrons in the diner stop talking, turn in their chairs and stare at the two of us as we laugh over Sam's infatuation with our new teacher. I apologize immediately to them for our adolescent behaviour.
â€œSam seriously, he's old enough to be your father.â€ I clean the counter to look busy when the diner door opens.
Almost immediately, I notice everything falling silent.
I glance over to see why the place has gone quiet, only to see four tall frames at the diner's entrance.Why were they here? They looked so out of place.
Bane walks with confidence towards the closest patron, leaving the other three standing guard at the door. He leans down to one of the regulars and speaks to him. I didn't know how I could hear him, but I heard every single word.
â€œYou might wanna stop staring at us before I tear you apart piece by piece big man.â€
â€œHey!â€ I rush from behind the counter, stand directly in front of him only to be met with a broad chest.
â€œI don't care who you are, but I won't have you talking to the regulars like that.â€
At this point, Ryder stands by Bane's side, never taking his eyes away from me.
â€œAre you saying we aren't welcome here because we're not regulars?â€ Bane looks at me with pure disgust written on his face.
â€œOf course, you're welcome here, but if you're going to disrespect the regulars then I'm going to have to ask you to leave.â€
I say this with as much confidence as I can muster, but with Ryder standing with his eyes on me the whole time, I'm really quite surprised I haven't shat myself.
â€œWe aren't here to start trouble. We just came to have some food in this highly recommended diner that you have here.â€ Ryder's voice fills the whole diner. While he speaks, I can't help but stand there looking into his bright green eyes.
â€œWell, as long as you don't start trouble, take a seat, and I'll grab you some menus.â€ I say.
Neither of us takes our eyes away from each other, but the connection is broken too quickly when I hear Sam's voice calling me.
â€œAlice! Where the hell are my goddamn fries!?â€
I turn around to see Sam giving me the grumpiest look ever known to mankind.
Without looking at Ryder, I excuse myself and walk behind the counter, my hands shake as I grab four menus and four pairs of cutlery. I glance up again to see Ryder sitting in one of the booths with his friends, but his eyes remain on me.
â€œI'm known for being a patient person, but please give me my fries!â€
â€œI told Terry to take his time, so whenever Terry's ready to make your fries, he'll make them.â€
I walk past the counter, and laugh when I hear Sam confronting Terry in the kitchen.
While that's happening, I stand at the edge of the table and hand Ryder all the menus.
â€œI'll be back in a few minutes to take your order. Kitchen closes at seven thirty.â€ I hurry back to the cashier, when I notice Sam sitting back in her seat, with a few fries on a plate.
â€œThose aren't yours, are they?â€ I point towards the fries on the plate just as I hear Terry yelling from the kitchen.
â€œNope, but they're mine now.â€ She grabs for another fry just as her elbow knocks the milkshake over, and that's when everything happens in slow motion.
Time slows down as I see the milkshake descend to the floor. I feel this uncontrollable urge to catch it before it falls. With the time slowing down, it gives me enough time to catch it, just inches before it spills everywhere. I look at the milkshake resting in my hand and check around me to see if anyone noticed, but I'm only met with four curious sets of eyes.
â€œNice reflexes you got there Alice.â€
Sam doesn't seem as freaked out like I am right now. Instead, she picks up another fry just as I slam down the milkshake on the counter, to which it topples over.
My breath hitches, â€œYou didn't see that?â€
â€œSee what? You rescuing my delicious milkshake that is now spilling everywhere on this counter?â€
â€œSam, honestly, I'm freaking out right now!â€ â€œAre you okay? Want me to call your mum?â€
â€œNo, I just. I need to tell you something about what happened here last night.â€ I whisper to her over the counter in the hope that nobody hears me.
â€œWhat's going on with you today? And why are you whispering? No one's looking at us.â€
â€œThey're watching.â€ I answer.
Sam remains looking at them until she turns around and tells me that they're leaving.
â€œWhat's the problem? What happened last night?â€
I take a steady breath, and replay the events of last night. â€œI was working here last night until closing hour. Terry and I were the only ones left at the diner. He asked me to take the trash out to the dumpster and I heard a growl from behind me. It was so quiet I thought I didn't hear anything, but I turned around and saw the biggest wolf I've ever seen, and I've never seen a wolf that big before in Small Town.â€
Sam rolls her eyes. â€œI mean we see wolves all the time, we live in Small Town for gods sakes! We're gonna see wolves running around and for one being here, it was probably drawn to the smell of rotting food or something.â€
Sam grabs her schoolbag from the floor, and starts packing her things.
â€œSam, I'm telling you, it was huge! It bit me right on the shoulder and ran away!â€
Sam stops packing her thing, and looks at me with pure worry on her face.
â€œIt bit you? Did you tell your mum to look at it?â€
I shake my head knowing she's about to have an outburst. â€œNo.â€
â€œWhy the hell not!? She's a nurse! God knows what that thing carries.â€
â€œThere wasn't any point in telling her because by the time I went to bed the cuts were all sealed closed, and the marks were completely gone when I changed for work.â€
I show her my shoulder to find it still the same. No bite marks.
â€œWhy didn't you say anything in school?â€
â€œI didn't think it really mattered when I woke up this morning and only saw a few cuts there.â€ A pause.
â€œI wish I knew what to tell you or at least give you advice but...â€
Sam remains calm and collected, but I know that on the inside she worries too.
â€œYour milkshake would have been on the floor if I hadn't moved to grab it in time. I'm telling you now, everything in this room moved in slow motion like the time was slowing down for me to catch it before it leaked on the floor. And then hearing Bane whispering to Paul to stop staring or he'd tear him apart. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he's sitting right by the door and I'm all the way back here! Something's wrong with me!â€
I turn around to face the coffee machine and pour myself a large cup of coffee.
Sam speaks to me in a quiet and comforting tone, she probably knows that I'm close to losing my mind.
â€œThis all happened after it bit you?â€
â€œYeah, and it scares me to even think about what could happen to me. What if I actually turn into one?â€ I turn around with my mug of coffee and sit next to her.
Sam scoffs, â€œYou're my best friend, and whatever happens just know that I'll be there for you. Even if you don't want my help, you shouldn't go through this alone. So, if you do turn into a big scary wolf, which is impossible by the way, I promise not to tell anyone. The last thing I want is you chasing me on a full moon.â€
Sam stays with me till the end of the shift but leaves shortly when her mother comes to take her home. Sally offers to take me home, but I politely decline because I've got to lock up the diner.
I take out the trash, brush and mop the floor, then change out of my uniform. I lock up the back and exit through the front.
I double check that the door is locked when I hear rustling coming from behind me. I shrug it off blaming the wind, but when I hear it again I can't help but think it's the wolf from last night. I stay rooted to the ground in absolute fright when I hear laughter coming from behind me.
I turn around a little too quickly, and fall forwards on the floor.
â€œI didn't know for sure, but I had to check to see if I was right and now that I know, I was right about you.â€
I look up into Ryder's cold, distrusting green eyes.
I stand with unsteady legs, and shiver when my back connects with the diner's cold, damp door, â€œWhat are you talking about?â€
Ryder, Bane and Silver create a half circle around me. Ryder was standing in front of me while the other two stands on either side.
Kellan remains a little further behind Ryder, showing no signs of joining this little confrontation.
Silver steps forward, grabs my braid and pulls my head back hard. She leans forward right into my jugular and inhales. â€œShe's new, but she's changing fast. I wouldn't be surprised if she changes tonight if she survives that is.â€
She shoves my head forward and stands back.
It's Bane's turn to step forward. He stands in front of me, shielding Ryder from view. Bane reaches out with his giant-sized hand and wraps his hand around my delicate throat. â€œLet's get one thing clear here. I don't like you nor will I ever like you. I don't trust easily when it comes to people like you. His scent is all over you, and it's taking every ounce of control I have not to kill you.â€
â€œKill me?â€ I stutter.
â€œI promise you, if you get in my way and humiliate me again as you did in there, I'll kill you myself.â€
I reach with both of my hands to stop Bane from strangling me. His figure goes all blurry, when suddenly his hand disappears from my throat. I fall to the ground like a rag doll on all fours, and start gasping for air.
I hear them arguing above me, but I can't make out a single word.
I look up with blurry eyes to see Kellan standing in front of me in a protective stance.
â€œHe was killing her and you weren't gonna do shit about it! She's got nothing to do with the murders here!â€
Ryder's head tilts to the side as he listens to Kellan, â€œYou don't know that. Anyway, leave us. I need to have a little conversation with Alice. Alone.â€
Both Silver and Bane snicker like hyenas as they run into the middle of the road.
â€œKellan, leave. I'm not going to hurt her.â€
Ryder kneels down in front of me and cups my cheek gently.
As Kellan walks away, he turns around and looks at Ryder with warm, sorrowful eyes. â€œShe's no threat to us.â€
â€œGo home, Kellan!â€
By the time I can stand on my own two feet, Kellan's already out of sight.
Chapter 4

The last thing I wanted do right now is to have a conversation with Ryder. I'd rather stick pins in my eyes and cut out my tongue than speak to him. But here we are, in the middle of the night.
â€œLook, I'm really tired and a little pissed off with you and your friends. So just say what you got to say and leave me alone.â€
Hopefully, he'll never have to speak to me again. â€œWhat happened to you last night?â€
I should have moved when I had the chance because right now, my boobs are getting to know his chest really well.
â€œAbsolutely nothing. And anyway, it's not like I owe you an explanation.â€
Ryder cages me in with both of his hands on either side of my head. â€œYou think I didn't see you inside that diner? We all did! So I need to know what happened to you last night.â€
â€œWhy is it so important for you to know?â€ I duck underneath his arm, and start walking.
â€œAlice! You need to listen to me.â€
Before I know it, Ryder grabs my wrist and turns me around to face him. â€œYou may not believe me, but I'm trying to help you.â€ â€œHelp me!?â€
â€œI'm trying to help you understand what you're about to go through.â€
â€œAnd what would that be?â€ I take my hand from his hold, and place my hands on my hips in expectation of his answer.
â€œYou might think I'm joking, but trust me I'm not.â€ Ryder turns his back on me, places his hands in his pockets and sighs in defeat. â€œIn a few days, you'll go through the change.â€
I frown. â€œThe change?â€
â€œVery soon, you'll experience the change. The change of becoming a wolf.â€
A what?
I look at him in confusion, then burst out laughing.
He turns around and looks at me, his nostrils flaring â€œStop laughing. This is not a joke. I don't joke about things like this. By the look of things, it's going to happen pretty soon.â€
Surely he doesn't mean that I'm actually going to turn into a wolf because that's just crazy.
I roll my eyes, â€œOkay, I'll play along. What happens during this change?â€
â€œPain. A lot of pain.â€

GOD PROVIDED EVERYTHING WE NEED FOR HEALTH

God provided us with awesome bodies capable of healing themselves and resisting tremendous strains. He provided all the foods we need to keep our bodies healthy. He even left clue in some of the foods to let us know they were especially good for certain organs and parts of the body. The chart below shows some examples.

A sliced Carrot looks like the human eye. The pupil, iris and radiating lines look just like the human eye - and science now shows carrots greatly enhance blood flow to and function of the eyes.

A Tomato has four chambers and is red. The heart has four chambers and is red. All of the research shows tomatoes are loaded with lycopine and are indeed pure heart and blood food.

Grapes hang in a cluster that has the shape of the heart. Each grape looks like a blood cell and all of the research today shows grapes are also profound heart and blood vitalizing food.

A Walnut looks like a little brain, a left and right hemisphere, upper cerebrums and lower cerebellums. Even the wrinkles or folds on the nut are just like the neo-cortex. We now know walnuts help develop more than three (3) dozen neuron-transmitters for brain function.

47

Kidney Beans actually heal and help maintain kidney function and they look exactly like the human kidneys.

Celery, Bok Choy, Rhubarb and many more look just like bones. These foods specifically target bone strength. Bones are 23% sodium and these foods are 23% sodium. If you don't have enough sodium in your diet, the body pulls it from the bones, thus making them weak. These foods replenish the skeletal needs of the body.

Avocadoes, Eggplant and Pears target the health and function of the womb and cervix of the female - they look just like these organs. Today's research shows that when a woman eats one avocado a week, it balances hormones, sheds unwanted birth weight, and prevents cervical cancers. And how profound is this? It takes exactly nine (9) months to grow an avocado from blossom to ripened fruit. There are over 14,000 photolytic chemical constituents of nutrition in each one of these foods (modern science has only studied and named about 141 of them).

Figs are full of seeds and hang in twos when they grow. Figs increase the mobility of male sperm and increase the numbers of Sperm as well to overcome male sterility.

Sweet Potatoes look like the pancreas and actually balance the glycemic index of diabetics.

Olives assist the health and function of the ovaries.

48

Oranges, Grapefruits, and other Citrus fruits look just like the mammary glands of the female and actually assist the health of the breasts and the movement of lymph in and out of the breasts.

Onions look like the body's cells. Today's research shows onions help clear waste materials from all of the body cells. They even produce tears which wash the epithelial layers of the eyes. A working companion, Garlic, also helps eliminate waste materials and dangerous free radicals from the body

There are many other delicious fruits and vegetables God has provided for us all the things we need for a healthy body. One example is honey, often called the perfect food because of the many healing properties associated with it. Salt water, while we canâ€™t drink it, has many healing properties for our outside bodies; a salt water bath, for instance, is very soothing and healing for sore muscles. Salt water is also a great source for iodine. Everything we need was provided long before we were ever created.

Researchers are just beginning to uncover that all we needed was here all along. Even the formulas for our drugs begin from foods that have healing properties.

CREDITS

Information was gathered from multiple websites, articles, research papers, talking to doctors, the American Diabetes Association and personal experience. The book Reverse

Diabetes Now had a definite influence as regards information and format. Information was verified for accuracy before I began a pH balancing program and again before including in this book. I highly recommend the above book. It contains far more background information with references.
