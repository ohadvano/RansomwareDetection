“Fine. We'll do it your way, but as part of teaching your new abilities, I want you to come and find me.” Ryder winks at me just before he slides down his blue jeans along with his briefs.
Maybe I should have turned away when I had the chance because that image will forever be inside my head.
When I try to gather my thoughts after seeing Ryder's
naked body, I turn to see that Kellan and Bane have shifted already and started to run into the woods. I look back at Ryder when I find that I can't contain my breathing. The view right in front of me suddenly feels unrealistic.
He stands twice the size he was just now, I'd need to stretch my whole arm upwards to be able to touch his snout. He lowers his head as if he's studying me very carefully, and he probably recognizes my scent from before when I attacked him in Sam's house. I don't move a single muscle in case any kind of movement will aggravate the Alpha standing fearless in front of me.
A few minutes go by with him just staring intensely at me, a part of me is scared of what this beast might do to me, but I know Ryder wouldn't hurt me on purpose. Ryder takes one more look at me, turns around and follows the same footprints as Bane and Kellan.
I let out a breath of relief when Ryder's form disappears but I'm left feeling lost with what to do next.
I was told to keep calm but how can I when my heart is racing?
I hastily take off my white sandals, my white tank top and throw it to the floor followed by my ripped jeans. I look around consciously hoping that nobody can see me but relax when I realize that nobody would be out here, other than the occupants that live here. I undo the straps of my bra followed by my underwear and stand alone in the wolves' yard. I close my eyes to focus on slowing my heart rate and take deep breaths.
