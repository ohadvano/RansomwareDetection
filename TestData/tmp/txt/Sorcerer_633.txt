Trewanti bent the stiffness out of her neck. “I wish you the best of luck. I’ll go back to my home in the forest—with your requests in mind. I might consider prostitution. I’m sure I can find some homosexuals who like their assholes plowed.”
Kiran grimaced. “Okay. It’s better than rape, I guess.”
“Are you coming with us Aparna?” said Gatril.
Aparna took a sip of her malt beverage and said, “No. My work here is done. I need to collect the last ingredients for my other spells.”
“We can help you if you want,” said Kiran. “It’s the least I can do.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Aparna replied. “My quests aren’t as dangerous as yours.”
Gatril smacked Kiran with her tail. He winced and rubbed his thigh. “Ouch, Gatril!”
“Stop being so pushy already,” Gatril said. “The women don’t have time to be your little sex maids. Trewanti has blood to suck and Aparna has...animals to attend to.”
Kiran said, “Well good luck then, guys.”
“Thanks,” said Aparna. 
Trewanti remained silent, only shrugging. 
“When are you leaving, Kiran?” said Aparna.
“I think I’ll need about four days for my arm to heal,” said Kiran.
“So short?” said Gatril.
“Spirit energy can be used to heal the body,” said Kiran. “I need to start working on that spell too before the queex goes off.”
“Don’t worry,” said Trewanti, slightly opening her legs. “There’s always more when you need it, young sorcerer.”

CHAPTER FIVE

Three days of preparation, and the young wizard and his dragon accomplice were ready for the final leg of their journey. The morning started off with a hearty breakfast of oatmeal, bread and pork. They went over their equipment; Kiran mostly taking up that task.
Kiran had gotten some more supplies from the merchants in town, storing them in the back of his quacycle and backpack. Trewanti was the first to leave, transforming into her frightening form and flying back to the forest. Kiran and Gatril got onto the quacycle and rode off, waving back at the shrinking image of Aparna.
The quacycle’s wheels spun over miles of earth and grass uphill until their destination faded into sight. 
It was once called Ashfield Road, named after the legend of bodies that were burnt after a massive war between two tribes, and the crisp remains of the corpses had rained upon the land that day like dark snowflakes. But that was decades ago, and now lush trees that called all manner of wildlife within the surrounding greenage stood here, hence its new name the Preteblu Hills.
 Mongooses scuttled across the ground and gay birds chirps and flew overhead. The leaves ruffled like paper being crushed next to the ear in the winds, and for the briefest moment, the thought of confronting ferocious beasts slipped out of Kiran’s mind.
Gatril felt his muscles relax, and the quacycle slowed. “You feeling okay?”
“I’m good,” Kiran said.
Gatril tightened her arms around Kiran, and rested her chin atop his locks. Regardless of the barriers of their species and social standing, the comfort of his presence was too good to pass up on. 
“We’re almost there,” Kiran said.
And that was when their ambushers struck, barging out of the bushes with clubs, machetes and crude-looking blasters in hand. 
They were of the shape of men, hairy with a hyena’s snout and ears, hunched over with a mane of bristly hair running from their backs atop their heads. Grating cackles filled Kiran’s and Gatril’s ears, and they quickly stopped the quacycle and hopped off as the seven beasts surrounded them.
“What are they?” Kiran said, switching between the individuals, the stones in his staff already lambent from his spirit energy.
“Bultungins,” sneered Gatril. She forcefully flicked her tail around unpredictably, sending a message to the beasts one foul move would befall something horrible upon them.
They all wore various animal skins that had crudely torn edges, and all manner of trinkets that seemed to have sculpted by more skilled hands as opposed to the dirty, clawed ones of the bultungins.
Kiran knew the human crafts in particular the bultungins didn’t get by righteous means.
One with his mane dyed white approached them, eagerly tapping a femur tipped with an axe-head in his palm. He rose above them by inches, and the width of his shoulders told the pair a blow dealt by his hand would be fatal.
