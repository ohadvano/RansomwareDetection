Sam jumps off the bed and confronts Ryder. “How dare you speak about her like that! It's not her fault!”
I'm lying on the bed drenched in sweat with my whole body in indescribable pain when I notice that both Sam and Ryder arguing. I struggle to open my mouth to make them stop, but I can't do anything other than listen to them.
How much longer!?
Suddenly my back arches off the bed, and I hear the cracking snap of my bones breaking and reforming throughout my body. I'm screaming at the gut-wrenching pain it's causing inside of me. Sam and Ryder stop arguing when they hear the ear splitting scream that leaves my mouth.
“This is it.” Ryder helps me off the bed and gently puts me on the floor.
“Oh my God, it's happening.” Sam shrieks.
“Sam be quiet.” He cups my cheeks. “You're doing really well.”
“Am I gonna die?” I'm trying to focus on Ryder's face through my blurry haze.
“Absolutely not because you know why, Alice?” “Why?”
