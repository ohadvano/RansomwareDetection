“My name is Kiran,” the young man said. “And this is Gatril. I’m a sorcerer.”
“I could tell,” said Aparna, gesturing to Kiran’s staff. “I guess you could call me a sorceress then.”
It was as if someone quickly wound up Kiran, straighten his back and widening his eyes. “Really? You practice magic too?”
Aparna nodded. “I was getting this zebra semen for my spell.” Aparna looked Kiran with heightened curiosity. “Wait, would you be entering the Witching Tournament by any chance?”
“Yeah,” said Kiran. “I’m here trying to get some popobawa queex.”
Aparna said, “Really? That sounds a little dangerous though. I know a few people who got attacked by them. They got their blood drank, some even got raped. I heard they used to attack the townsfolk until they got guns and killed them off. Now only one lurks in the forest nearby, but no one dares to venture inside.”
“That’s no problem,” said Gatril. “We fought something much scarier than that just yesterday. Do you happen to live around here?”
“No,” said Aparna. “I’m actually visiting from Gabanyi. I came here for a few ingredients that could only be found on this side of the continent. So far I’ve gotten two of the four. I need the queex of a brustark and the semen of a dandepuffer.”
“Those aren’t easy animals to capture either,” said Gatril. “Especially the brustark.”
“Don’t worry,” said Aparna. She gestured to the zebra behind her, now going about its business grazing. “I can drug them like I did this one.”
“Dandepuffers are close to my village,” said Kiran. “Opposite of where I found you, Gatril.”
Something had been bothering Gatril, and she said, “But Kiran, she just mentioned that the popobawa usually rape people. Are they all males, or do they also have females?”
“They are a bit of both,” said Kiran. “They tend to look like females, but they have a five-inch-long clitoris they use to have intercourse with and release semen. I just need to knock her out and capture her.”
“Okay,” said Gatril. “You know Kiran, you’re starting to sound like a real sexplorer.”
“No,” said Kiran. “I always ask nicely for their queex first. The last beast was killing and eating innocent people, like the popobawa are. I’ve never killed anyone either.”
Gatril didn’t protest any further, but said, “Well we better get some rest. I think it’s best we do it tomorrow night after we’ve recovered.”
“You’re both welcome to stay with me if you want,” said Aparna. “I have enough space in my room that I booked.”
“Really? Thanks!” said Kiran. 
“No problem,” said Aparna. “It’s a pleasure to help a fellow practitioner of magic.”
Gatril groaned and rubbed her head. “Ah, I’m not too fancying going into human territory every minute. I know this question might sound off topic, but isn’t there a place where humans and beasts get together?”
Kiran folded his arms and looked at the ground as he tried to figure out something that could help. “Hmph.” Kiran unfolded his arms and looked at the two women. “There’s a place called a Furshack where humans and beasts meet, but that’s way on the north coast where the ships dock. Even if we could afford to refuel my quacycle, it will take around five days to reach there.”
Gatril frowned. “Nah, forget it. We don’t have enough resources or tools to defend ourselves. Let’s just finish up with your task and then we’ll get a move on. I’ll just stick around here by myself.”
“Are you serious?” said Kiran. 
“Boy,” said Gatril, “I’ve been living on my own for years. This won’t be anything.” Gatril abruptly pulled close and whispered in his ear. “Now go and have some fun with your new friend here. But make sure she washes the semen out of her mouth first.”
Kiran frowned at her. “Really, Gatril?”
“Stop being a wimp and let’s get going,” Gatril said, walking back to the quacycle with the others.
Kiran towed the vehicle next to him in a walking pace with the two females. Once they were close to the town, Gatril gestured a few trees that she would mark as the checkpoint for Kiran to meet her outside.
Aparna took Kiran by the hand and lead him through the streets, careful to avoid the prostitutes, police, back-alley merchants and other unscrupulous characters lurking about. Kiran’s interest in his new, taller companion wasn’t subtle either, as he kept sneaking stares at her face and chest. But it wasn’t by the influence of his hormones either, for he wondered what kind of magic she possessed in her arsenal.
They came to a white building that was the inn. Inside Aparna showed the receptionist her key and they allowed her and Kiran upstairs to the rooms.
“Right here, Kiran,” Aparna said as she brought them to a door at the end of the hallway, next to a window that glowed white from the sunlight.
Aparna opened the door and they went inside. The walls were made from clay, polished and painted in a beige color. The caretakers had put more effort in making the walls and ceiling more ornate, and the room carried a sweet scent of vanilla.
Aparna turned to Kiran and said as she took off her knapsack and cloak, “Make yourself comfortable.”
“…Sure.” Kiran put down his knapsack on the table next to Aparna’s and took off his shoes. 
He saw that one of the beds was untouched and chose that one to lay down in—and abruptly looked up when he saw Aparna stripping down to nothing but her underwear. Aparna’s slender frame manage to have enough curves to entice Kiran, and her bottom, though small, was well rounded.
Kiran realized his eyes weren’t coming off her and he closed them, finally looking away. Aparna hung her clothes on a rack and took out a beaded necklace from a drawer. “So Kiran,” she said, sitting on the other bed and looking across at him, “what kind of spells have you gathered so far?”
