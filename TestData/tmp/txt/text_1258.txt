The first thing I do when I leave the hospital is text Sam for the address of the party. The sensible side of me would be to not text her and go home where I can sit down with a good book or catch up with homework. After this week, I feel that going tonight to the party and having a few drinks couldn't hurt anybody because for once in my life, I can let my hair down and enjoy myself.
I won't have to worry about changing unexpectedly, I've proven all that I needed to prove, so for that I won't let anything stop me from having somewhat of a good time.
“So whereabouts is this party?” Max asks as he takes out his car keys and twirls them around his fingers.
“I don't know, but I've texted Sam to ask where it is because she's probably there right now dancing on the tables or something.”
He chuckles. “Is that something she does at every party?”
I shiver against the gust of wind that passes by which makes me rub both of my hands together. “She likes to have fun which is the complete opposite of me.” I sigh and shake my head in despair. “I don't even know why I'm going to this party. I mean I hate social activities.”
Max takes off his leather jacket and places it around my shoulders. “Here, this will keep you nice and warm.”
He presses the button to unlock his black Range Rover, stands on the passenger side, places his hand on the door and looks at me. “You're going tonight because you wanna look out for your friend, and that makes you a good person. Maybe you know deep down that she needs someone to look after her.”
I consider his words and slowly nod.
