CHOCOLATE VERSUS CAROB



Nutritional y, carob is everything that chocolate is not. Gram for gram, carob

contains three times the calcium that milk does. It is high in phosphorus and potassium,

plus it contains some sodium and iron. Carob is rich in protein and high in natural

carbohydrates. Although very sweet, it is 60 percent lower in calories than chocolate.

While chocolate is a robber of nutrients, carob is a replenisher. Carob has as much

thiamine (Bl) as asparagus or strawberries, as much niacin (B3) as lima beans, lentils or

peas, and more vitamin A than eggplant or asparagus. As an added bonus, it has 46



93

percent natural sugar, where cocoa has only 5 1/2 percent. Carob is low in fat whereas

chocolate is high in fat. Carob contains no caffeine or other stimulants, and best of al

contains no insect fragments.

Where does carob come from? It comes from the carob tree, a beautiful evergreen

tree rounded in form, with somewhat oval-shaped glossy leaves. The carob tree stands as

tal as 50 feet when ful grown. The pods are flat like lima beans and measure from 3 to 12

inches in length. They are rich dark brown in color. The pods contain 5-15 seeds which

are discarded.

CHOLESTEROL





Cholesterol is a substance that can only be found in meat, poultry, fish, and animal

products such as eggs, milk and cheese. Foods from the plant kingdom such as fruits,

vegetables, grains, nuts, etc., do not have any cholesterol.



There are two types of cholesterol: one is the high density lipoprotein cholesterol

(HDL) which the body manufactures and is necessary for the maintenance of optimum

health; the second type is low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) which is the bad

cholesterol that causes most of the trouble. Meat, animal products, oils, fats and grease of

al kinds are the foods most responsible for low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL).

Therefore, these items should be eliminated from the diet.(1) The ideal diet for lowering

cholesterol is a diet low in natural fats and protein (such as avocados, nuts, etc.) and high

in complex carbohydrates, which are whole grains, vegetables, legumes (peas & beans),

tubers (potatoes), fruits, honey, etc.



Cholesterol can also be reduced by eating a diet high in fiber. Al grains are high in

fiber. Hard red spring wheat was reported in 1978 by a United States Government

scientist to cause a 17% decrease in low density lipoprotein cholesterol.(2) If people ate

complex carbohydrate food that contain natural fiber we would not have today's epidemic

of high cholesterol. The more natural the food the better. Oat bran, for example, is not a

whole natural food, for the bran has been removed from the oat. It would be better to use

oatmeal as opposed to oat bran.



Another way to help lower cholesterol is by sunbathing. It is important to note that

cholesterol and Vitamin D are related, for when cholesterol in the skin is exposed to

sunlight, it may easily be changed to Vitamin D and thereby made harmless to the body. It

was in 1904 that one research scientist discovered that sunlight was able to transform

cholesterol to Vitamin D. Human skin has a very rich supply of cholesterol, and this

cholesterol keeps moving back and forth between the skin and the blood stream. If it is

removed from the skin, then the cholesterol from the blood stream moves into the skin to



95

replace the cholesterol that was lost. It has been found that sunlight wil cause a reduction

of cholesterol in the skin and it also affects the overal cholesterol metabolism of the whole

body. When the skin is exposed to sunlight, cholesterol is destroyed so rapidly and to

such a great extent that the total body cholesterol is decreased. A study was done using

30 patients who had hardening of the arteries. Each of these patient's blood cholesterol

level was taken before a sunbath. The results showed that there was almost a 13%

decrease in the blood cholesterol fol owing the treatment.(3)

You may wonder then, if I sunbathe to lower my cholesterol, what do I do about the

possibility of getting skin cancer from al the sunbathing? According to Dr. Kime, in his

book, Sunlight Could Save Your Life, if you take a moderate amount of sun and do not eat

meat, animal products or refined oils, your chances of getting skin cancer are rare. There

is little doubt in the research literature, as to whether or not a high fat diet promotes a

higher and earlier incidence of skin cancer due to ultraviolet light.(4)

For years we have accepted cholesterol levels of 250-300 mg% as "normal" in our

society because ninety percent of Americans fal into that range. While these levels may

be common for Americans, (where every second person dies of atherosclerosis), they are

not ideal. The ideal cholesterol is 100 plus your age, not to exceed 160 mg%. Dr. Antonio

Gotto M.D., president of the American Heart Association, stated in a U.S. Senate hearing,

that if we lower the cholesterol count of everyone in the United States to below 150 mg%,

we would probably wipe out heart disease. (5)



There are several cholesterol lowering drugs. Big expensive investigations of these

drugs report success in reducing blood cholesterol by levels of five to ten percent.

Unfortunately, none of these drugs improve life expectancy. On the contrary, they prove

more harmful than helpful. They produce unpleasant and distressing effects and

excessive mortality. (6)



The more we learn about cholesterol, the more we realize that by fol owing a

natural diet, the one given to us in the Garden of Eden, the healthier we wil be.

DEODORANTS

AND ANTIPERSPIRANTS





Perspiration is a normal body function. Basical y, three things are accomplished by

sweating: the body temperature is control ed by cooling, certain wastes are removed from

the body, and the skin is kept smooth and pliable.

Sweat never lets up: the body is constantly perspiring - up to a quart per day - even

when one is immersed in water.

Most perspiration is produced by a secretion from the endocrine sweat glands -

glands distributed over almost the entire surface of the body's skin. The eccrine glands are

usual y active only during exercise, on hot days or during nervousness or embarrassment.

Mil ions of Americans are concerned about the perspiration problem and what to

buy to combat the problem. Americans spend close to two bil ion dol ars ($1.7) on

deodorants and antiperspirants each year.

Mum was the first commercial personal deodorant product sold in this country in 1888. It

contained bacteria-squelching zinc oxide and was smeared on with the finger. Before this,

ammonia and water, talcum powders and perfumes had been used. Antiperspirants came

a few years later, but the early products in this field were plagued by a number of

problems. At that time, many antiperspirants were a solution of aluminum chloride.



Is there a difference between a deodorant and an antiperspirant? Yes! A deodorant

prevents the development of odor in perspiration. It is designed to combat odors, but wil

not keep you dryer since it does not reduce the amount of perspiration. Deodorants simply

mask odor. An antiperspirant reduces the amount of perspiration that reaches the skin's

surface. It is designed to reduce the amount of wetness.

Antiperspirants are more complicated, both in composition and action. Like

deodorants, they almost always contain bactericidal agents. However, they do not stop

there, as it's their intention to prevent moisture, as wel as odor. Their containers always

show a listing of active ingredients, the most common of which is aluminum salts -
