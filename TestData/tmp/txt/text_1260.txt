The only word that comes to my mind when I look at this house is utterly breath-taking. The house is surrounded by glass and from the exact spot to where I'm standing, I can see everything. From here I see people dancing together, playing beer pong and some even doing body shots.
Hopefully Sam wasn't embarrassing herself in there.
I decide to go inside before changing my mind and take the stairs two at a time. Max can choose whether to follow or stick around outside but I have someone that I need to find. I push through the bodies that are in my way, to which I receive dirty looks and murmurs that are too quiet for me to understand. I finally get myself into the living room where I see a lot of people kissing and some doing things that I wish they could take outside.
People dance in the middle of the room but Sam is nowhere to be seen. I look behind me to see Max pushing his way through with the look of annoyance on his face, I call out his name but it's drowned out by the sound of music.
Having looked around the living area more than once, I decide to look for Sam in the kitchen, and the first thing I see is a stunning girl propped up on the steel counter wearing a tight silver dress covered in sparkles. The minute Silver's eyes meet mine she rolls her eyes.
“If you're trying to get Ryder's attention, he won't spare you a glance dressed like that.”
She takes in my black skinny jeans, the band t-shirt and leather jacket.
I ignore her and get right to the point. “Have you seen Sam anywhere?”
“Why would I care about where your annoying little friend is?”
