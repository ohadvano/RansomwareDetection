The popobawa chuckled and held him close. Their love sounds filled the nest, with Aparna and Gatril watching from the other side. Once the popobawa felt Kiran’s grip tighten on her flesh she knew what was coming. She clenched her muscles and held him in place as Kiran’s warm juices flooded inside her. The popobawa closed her eyes and as the hot fluid nestled inside her, her flesh willingly absorbing everything he had to offer.
“Wow,” said Gatril. “That was…”
“Sensual,” said Aparna.
“Well,” Gatril said, “I was thinking more of, fricking aces!”

Kiran got some more rest, though a beast such as the popobawa, who called herself Trewanti, was already beginning to recover from the non-lethal wound. While Aparna went back to the inn to fetch Kiran some more supplies, Gatril and Trewanti got wet clothes and wiped down Kiran, also giving him mint sticks to remove the smell of crotch from his breath.
Trewanti kept any thoughts or opinions behind her sealed lips most of the time, raising both Kiran’s and Gatril’s interest. After they’d put on back his shorts, Kiran said, “Trewanti…”
“Yes?” the woman sat on the ground and crossed her legs. She was still naked, still in her humanoid skin. 
“So, what will you do now?” said Kiran.
Trewanti smiled with a playful charm. “I’m still a popobawa. I need to feed.on blood, and I still possess my urge for intercourse, especially with beasts and humans anally.”
Kiran sighed, and said, “Do you think could not feed on humans or beasts, just animals? I wouldn’t want to have to confront you like this again.”
“Ai,” said Trewanti, “you humans and your demands. Always acting like you have the right to everything.”
“The request is fair enough,” said Gatril, folding her arms. “Just stop killing and raping humans and beasts.”
Trewanti returned a contemptuous gaze at Gatril, and said, “Is that how he got you? He beat you up, captured you and force you to suck his cock?”
“Nope,” said Gatril, “I actually captured him when he tried to. I just so happen to have taken a liking to him and let him mount me.”
Kiran laid an annoyed scowl upon Gatril. “No one needed to know that?”
“And you believe they don’t think that?” said Gatril. She turned to Trewanti. “He’s my sex companion.”
“I’m a sorcerer too,” said Kiran assertively. “I’m on my way to enter the Witching Tournament. The last thing on my list is a j’bafofi.”
Gatril saw the chink in Trewanti’s smile and said, “What, you don’t think he can do it?”
“I never said that,” said Trewanti. “I’m just wondering how’ll he’ll deal with the competition.”
“What are you talking about?” Kiran’s displeasure lead him to ignore his discomfort and sit up. 
“I take it you mean the female j’bafofi,” said Trewanti. “In that case, she always has many of her males trying to impress her with the sole intent of planting their seeds inside her. If they fail, she simply eats them.”
“I know that,” said Kiran. “I have plans to take her down.”
“The simple traps you have?” Trewanti chuckled, her mocking tone reverberating in Kiran’s ear. “They’re around thirteen j’bafofi nests in this country, the closest being in the Preteblu Hills seven miles from here. Rumors say that they’ve already overrun a small town; the males in particular, trying their best to impress the female with special human trinkets.”
“All the more reason to go there,” said Kiran. “If I can stop that J’bafofi, I can make a name for myself too.”
Trewanti bent the stiffness out of her neck. “I wish you the best of luck. I’ll go back to my home in the forest—with your requests in mind. I might consider prostitution. I’m sure I can find some homosexuals who like their assholes plowed.”
Kiran grimaced. “Okay. It’s better than rape, I guess.”
“Are you coming with us Aparna?” said Gatril.
Aparna took a sip of her malt beverage and said, “No. My work here is done. I need to collect the last ingredients for my other spells.”
“We can help you if you want,” said Kiran. “It’s the least I can do.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Aparna replied. “My quests aren’t as dangerous as yours.”
Gatril smacked Kiran with her tail. He winced and rubbed his thigh. “Ouch, Gatril!”
“Stop being so pushy already,” Gatril said. “The women don’t have time to be your little sex maids. Trewanti has blood to suck and Aparna has...animals to attend to.”
Kiran said, “Well good luck then, guys.”
“Thanks,” said Aparna.
