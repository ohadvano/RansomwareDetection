As a way of an apology I lean forward, clutch him tightly to my chest in a friendly embrace, but as I pull back, his face is inches away from mine. I stay rooted to the spot not knowing what to do, and before I have the chance to process what's happening, Max's lips meet mine.
I jerk my head back quickly and move to put some distance between us.
Max closes his eyes and shakes his head. “I'm so sorry. I don't know what I was thinking.”
“No it's fine. You don't need to apologise.”
Max avoids eye contact, looks down at the floor to realize that his shirt is torn.
“I had to cut your shirt to see if you had anything underneath that needed some treatment.”
“Thanks.”
He climbs off the table and stands with his hands in his pockets. “I should be going. It shouldn't have been your responsibility to look after me so I really appreciate it. So, thanks.”
I shrug. “It's no big deal. Yu're my friend and friends help each other.”
