junk foods interfere with the working of the bodyâ€™s immune system.



ELIMINATE HIGH FAT DIET



Diets high in refined fats have long been associated with increased cancer risk. Breast

cancer is more frequent in women on diets high in both saturated fats, (whole milk), and in

animal fat.(2) A low fat diet not only prevents breast cancer but increases the survival of

women who already have breast cancer. (3)



EAT A TOTALLY RAW DIET



This is or wil be the hardest single thing to fol ow, but it is very important. Only raw fruits,

vegetables, nuts and sprouted grains are what you wil be eating until your aids or cancer

is in remission. Nothing cooked no cooked beans, bread, potatoes, etc. Sounds tough, but

let me tel you this is much easier then taking chemotherapy and having your hair fal out,

vomiting, being weak, etc. And, of course chemotherapy for cancer or AZT for aids wil

not build up your immune system. Instead it wil tear it down. Raw food is live food and

possesses the highest nutritive value. It is ful of vitamins, mineral, enzymes,

phytochemicals, etc. Cooked food is dead food, plant any seed and it wil grow. Cook the

seed and then plant it and it wil not grow, because itâ€™s life principle has been destroyed. .

Place cancer cel s in a cooked media and they wil proliferate. Now place the cancer cel s

in a raw matter and they wil disappear! This astounding fact is known to the Cancer

society, but the public was never informed. (4)



DO NOT EAT BETWEEN MEALS



A Swedish study indicated the frequency of snack eating may be related to the risk of

colon cancer. Earlier, largely ignored studies have suggested that each eating episode

over the course of the day increases colon cancer risk. Regular meal intake did not seem

to produce the same risk as did snack consumption. (Cancer Causes and Control3: 77-

81,1992)



72





DRINK ONE TO THREE GLASSES OF CARROT JUICE DAILY



Carrots are a very good source of Vitamin A, and the juice

should be taken 15-30 minutes before your vegetable meal. A

recent study done by Dr. Raymond J. Shamberger, Professor

of the Dept. of Biochemistry, the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio,

showed that Vitamin A is one of the most important aids to the

bodyâ€™s defense system fighting and preventing aids or cancer.

When subjected to carcinogens, this vitamin has a remarkable ability to inhibit the

introduction and or retard the growth of both malignant and non-malignant tumors. (5)



DRINK PLENTY OF PURE SOFT WATER



How much is plenty? It depends upon how much you weigh, you take your weight, divide it

in half and that is how many ounces of water you need in a 24 hour period. Of course if

you are working out in the hot sun and perspiring a lot you would need more. For

example: you weigh 160 lbs. Half of that is 80 so you need 80 ounces, which would be 10

eight ounce glasses. The type of water we need to drink is soft water that is water that has

no minerals, as the minerals in water are inorganic and are harmful to our health. Where

as the minerals in food are organic and our body needs these type of minerals. Two types

of water that have no minerals are distil ed water and reverse-osmosis water.



TAKE DAILY SUNBATHS



Expose as much of the body to the sun. If you have a light complexion start with ten

minutes and gradual y increase it to a minimum of one hour a day. While sun bathing use

no lotions, sunscreens (they can cause cancer), or oils. Do not wear glasses while sun

bathing as it is important for the ultraviolet light to get into the eyes, and glass of any kind

wil keep the rays out. Interferon is effective against several different kinds of cancer

including carcinoma, sarcoma and leukemia. This fact spurred the American Cancer

Society; to purchase interferon from Finland for experimental use. Dr. Hans Strander of

Finland discovered that he could give interferon to terminal bone cancer patients and

double the number of long term disease free survivors. White blood cel s in our bodies

manufacture this wonderful interferon that can help so dramatical y in cancer. Sunlight is a

great stimulus for increased white blood cel production and thereby increases the

production of interferon.



BARE FEET ON THE SOIL EVERY DAY



Everything on this earth has an electrical frequency, the earth, the seeds, the plants

animals, and the human body. Cancer cel s have a different electrical frequency than

normal cel s. Our bodies can easily get off the electrical frequency that they are suppose

to be on. How can we get it back on track? Very simply, by standing or walking bare foot

in the soil. Wearing shoes is not a natural thing, although we need to protect our feet, as

shoes insulate our body from the earth so it would be good to spend at least 10 minutes a

day outside barefoot in the soil.



73



GET PLENTY OF FRESH AIR



Deep breathing of fresh outside negatively charged air, (the good kind), helps cleanse the

lungs and increase circulation. Fresh air from the ocean, near a river or waterfal or after a

rain storm is not only negatively charged but is high in oxygen which is very beneficial for

cancer and aids. Be sure to have plenty of fresh air in your bedroom as you sleep, keep a

window open, even in the winter the window should be partial y open. A fact worth

knowing is that cancer cel s cannot live in the presence of oxygen. (6)



EXERCISE OUT OF DOORS



Brisk walking, no jogging, from one to five miles a day is excel ent exercise. If you do not

have the strength, start slowly and gradual y increase the distance. Exercise outside is 10

times more beneficial then indoors. When exercising inside you do not receive the suns

rays or the pure fresh air. Working out in a gym is like working out in a smel y tennis shoe.



GET 7-8 HOURS SLEEP EVERY NIGHT



The earlier you go to bed the better. Every hour of sleep before midnight is worth two

hours, every hour after midnight is worth one.



USE HERBS TAKE NO SUPPLEMENTS OF ANY KIND



There are many herbs for cancer, but the one I highly recommend is Red Clover. Note:

Red Clover is now being studied for the treatment of aids. You use only the flower, not the

stem or roots. Red clover contains the fol owing chemicals: biotin, choline, copper,

coumarins, glycosides, inositol, magnesium, manganesel, and selenium. It also contains

vitamins: A, B1, B3, B5, B6, B9, B12, B17, C, P and the mineral Zinc. This is quite an

assortment of minerals and vitamins for one herb. And possibly in the future we wil

discover it contains other important ingredients. Red Clover has been used in America for

over 100 years to treat and prevent cancer. It is good for cancer on any part of the body. I

have personal y used it for many years at my clinic and have seen many individuals

recover from cancer.



Use only the bulk red clover flowers, not the stem or roots, use no red clover capsules.

Make a tea by bringing the water to a boil, removing from the heat and adding the herb.

Let it steep for 20 minutes or longer. Use one to two teaspoons of herb per cup of tea. The

best time to take the tea is at night before bed on an empty stomach. If you take it twice a

day, then also first thing in the morning when you first get up on an empty stomach.

You can order the herb Red Clover from Frontier Herbs Phone 1-800-669-3275 or on line

at www.frontierherbs.com



Red Clover is now being studied for anti-aids and anti-diabetic activity. (7)



LEARN TO DEAL WITH STRESS

Almost everyone I have personal y known, who has come down with aids or cancer, have

been under a lot of stress prior to getting aids or cancer. We must learn to take the

problems we cannot handle to God, (The Greatest Healer Of Al Time). We cannot hold



74

anger, hate, selfishness, etc. inside ourselves or we wil not recover. The mind greatly

affects the body. I believe that 90% of al sickness starts in the mind.



Authors Note about Aids



There are many couples who are married, one of them has aids the other one does not, yet they

have a sexual relationship but the one does not come down with aids, why? The answer is simple,

because that person has kept their immune system at a high level by following many of the things I

have just outlined above.



WHAT CANCER CAN'T DO



It cannot cripple love,

It cannot shatter hope,

It cannot corrode faith,

It cannot eat away at peace,

It cannot destroy confidence,

It cannot kill friendship,

It cannot shut out memories,

It cannot silence courage,

It cannot evade the soul.

It cannot reduce eternal life,



IN CONCLUSION

If a person who has cancer or aids and fol ows these simple things I have outlined in this

article they wil notice improvement within less then two weeks, the closer you fol ow this

program the faster you wil improve. JUST THINK, it is possible for you to heal

yourself, you do not need surgery or expensive dangerous drugs. Al you need to do is

fol ow what I have outlined here.



ROSSANA WAS GIVEN LESS THAN ONE WEEK TO LIVE

I want to share with you the story of Rossana, she was 48 years old and had cancer.

When the doctors did surgery on her they saw that the cancer, which was original y in her

ovary had spread to the large and smal intestines and it was so extensive that they just

sewed her back up and gave her a week to live.

One of Rosannaâ€™s friends had heard me on the radio talking about cancer and so they

encouraged her to contact me. A friend and I went to her home visited with her and started

her on my special program at home, as it was another week before I was starting another

special 26 day clinic. She was very sick, in lots of pain and very weak.

She made it through the week at home and attended my special 26-day clinic. At the end

of the 26-day clinic she was stil alive, was up walking, in very little pain and had a lot of

energy and was even walking over a mile each day. Her doctor came to see her twice

while she was at the clinic and he could not believe how wel she was recovering without

the use of any drugs

ALZHEIMER'S

DISEASE AND

ALUMINUM





The body requires smal amounts of several organic metals for healthy functioning,

such as iron, zinc, and magnesium which are found in food. But there is no known human

need for aluminum, and the body is unable to handle the considerable quantities of

aluminum that it routinely encounters in modern food, water, and medications.

Much of the aluminum we ingest is excreted, mainly in the urine. Stil it is estimated

that 12% to 25% of ingested aluminum is absorbed into the body. A typical daily intake

may be 22 mil igrams of aluminum, although some people may get 100 times this amount.

Scientists formerly thought that aluminum was only poorly absorbed and was non-

toxic. But now we know that aluminum accumulates in various human tissues, especial y

the brain, lungs, liver, lymph nodes, bones, and parathyroid glands. Over the years

aluminum wil accumulate in the body, with older people having the largest accumulations,

resulting in major health problems.

Accumulation of aluminum in the brain has now been linked to three different kinds

of deterioration -senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, Parkinsonian dementia, and the

dialysis dementia found in patients with severe kidney failure who require blood dialysis.

The first report of aluminum poisoning came out in 1921. It cal ed attention to

tremors, memory loss, jerky movements, and uncoordination associated with aluminum;

but at that time very little was said or done about it. Several years ago aluminum once

again came into the lime light with dialysis centers treating patients with kidney failure.

Several times a week, patients would be connected to substitute kidney machines that

filtered body wastes from their bloodstreams. But some of the patients started going mad.

At first, the symptoms appeared only during dialysis - trouble with talking, confusion, and

muscle spasms. The symptoms would go away only to return with the next treatment.

Sliding swiftly downhil , patients became helpless, demented, bedridden, and final y they



77

died. Doctors cal ed the new disease dialysis dementia. They didn't know what caused it

or why some dialysis units had many patients with the mysterious il ness while others had

none.



The irregular but widespread distribution of cases suggested an environmental

poison or a trace element, says the man who final y found the answer, Dr. Alien C. Alfrey,

a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado. Autopsies of dialysis dementia

victims furnished a strategic clue: high concentrations of aluminum in the brain cel s.



It didn't take long to discover the source of the aluminum contamination. Large

amounts of tap water go into the dialysis solution used to flush wastes out of a patient's

bloodstream. (Many municipalities use aluminum to remove impurities from their water

supplies.) Although the dialysis treatment removed body wastes, aluminum eluded the

filtering system by attaching itself to blood proteins. As soon as it was recognized that

aluminum was the culprit, dialysis centers started using aluminum-free water for their

patients and there have been no new victims of dialysis dementia.



SOURCES OF ALUMINUM THAT WE INGEST



Aluminum salts are widely used as food additives, in non-prescription drugs, and as a

clarifying agent in the treatment of community water supplies.

Aluminum phosphates are the most commonly used aluminum-containing food

additives in the U.S., being frequently added to cake mixes, frozen doughs, self-rising

flours, processed cheeses, and cheese foods. They act as emulsifying agents, giving a

soft textured cheese which easily melts. Current U.S. regulations al ow 3% aluminum

phosphates in processed cheese products, which means that one slice of processed

cheese could supply up to 50 mg of aluminum.

Aluminum sulfates (alums) are common ingredients in household baking powders.

A teaspoonful of aluminum-containing baking powder may contain about 70 mg of

aluminum, so that a cake prepared with 2 tsp. of this powder would contain 10 mg of

aluminum per smal serving of cake. Aluminum sulfate is also being used as a food starch

modifier. Some companies use aluminum sulfate as firming agents in pickled vegetables

and fruits. A medium-sized pickled cucumber soaked in Dil alum solution may contain 5 to

10 mg aluminum.

Aluminum silicates are ordinarily used as anti-caking agents in dry, powdered

products. Some chewing gums contain aluminum at a level of 3-4 mg per stick.

Soft drinks have aluminum. Doctors at John Hunter Hospital analysed 106

aluminum cans and bottles representing 52 different beverages. Overal they found that

the most acidic beverages packaged in aluminum cans had the highest aluminum content.

Researchers found that non-cola soft drinks in aluminum cans contained the highest

levels of aluminum at an average of 33.4 me M/L. Cola drinks contained 24.4 me M/L in

cans and 8.9 me M/L in bottles. To put the fol owing figures in perspective, you should

know that the World Health Organization and the European Economic Community

recommend that drinking water not contain over 7.4 me M/L of aluminum.(Medical

Journal, August 92:156 (9): 604-5

Many non-prescription drugs also contain substantial levels of aluminum, including

antacids (for peptic ulcer, etc.), internal anti-pain medications (buffered aspirin for arthritic

pain and swel ing), diarrhea medicines (like Kaopectate) and hemorrhoidal medications.

Lipsticks and antiperspirants also contain high levels of aluminum. An antacid containing

aluminum hydroxide gel may provide up to 200 mg of aluminum per dose. Six grams of

buffered aspirin may provide over 400 mg of aluminum.



78



As one can readily see, aluminum is found in many items people use daily. It is

even in common table salt; however, sea salt, pickling salt, and rock salt contain no

aluminum.

Aluminum interferes with handling of iron by the body as wel as the formation of

heme (the pigment part of hemoglobin in red blood cel s). Thus, an excess of aluminum

can cause anemia.

Several reports suggest that a high aluminum intake may interfere with handling of

calcium, fluoride, and phosphorus by the body.

As mentioned earlier, accumulation of aluminum in the brain has now been linked

to Alzheimer's disease. Patients with Alzheimer's have brain aluminum concentrations that

are about four times higher than normal. In the U.S. almost 3 mil ion people have

Alzheimer's, and it kil s over 100,000 people a year. European studies have recently found

that communities with higher concentrations of aluminum in their drinking water had

substantial y more victims of Alzheimer's disease.



FACTS ON ALUMINUM COOKWARE



You buy a nice set of shiny aluminum cookware at the store, and six months later

the cookware is dul and pitted - what happened to it? The aluminum has left the cookware

and gone into the food that was cooked in it.

Boil some water in an aluminum kettle, pour it in a glass, and by holding it up to the

light you wil see aluminum particles floating in the water.

Peeled potatoes, if al owed to stand in an aluminum dish overnight, wil become

yel ow, and when cooked wil look shriveled and have dark streaks through the inner part.

Why? The potatoes absorbed some of the aluminum.

An acidic food heated and stored in aluminum cookware can add up to 4 mg of

aluminum to a serving of the food. One of the strongest indictments against aluminum

pots and pans was the testimony of Dr. H. A. McGuigan before the Federal Trade

Commission in docket Case No. 540.

A summary of Dr. McGuigan's findings, circulated by the National Committee

Against Fluoridation, charges that:

1. Boiling water in aluminum produces hydroxide poison.

2. Boiling an egg in aluminum cookware produces phosphate.

3. Boiling meat in aluminum cookware produces chloride.

4. Frying bacon in aluminum cookware produces a powerful narcotic acid, which in

large doses may cause coma.

5. Al vegetables cooked in aluminum produce hydroxide poison, which neutralizes

the digestive juices, robbing them of their value to digest food, and producing stomach

and gastro-intestinal troubles.

6. Aluminum poison wil produce acidosis which destroys the red blood cel s

producing a condition similar to anemia.



The wise thing to do is to throw away al your aluminum cookware and replace it

with stainless steel, glass, teflon, etc. cookware.

Aluminum is a poison to the human body; and the higher the concentration of

aluminum in the body, the more health problems one wil have. For optimum health one

must stop eating or drinking anything that contains aluminum, and begin drinking 8 or

more glasses of distil ed water or reverse osmosis water daily. Both distil ed and reverse

osmosis water is so pure and free of al minerals, chemicals, etc., that it wil start carrying

the aluminum deposits out of the body and you can once again begin to experience better

health.

AMALGAM FILLINGS

ARE HARMFUL



From the London Mal , November 13, 1983:

"Wife Gets Her Sight Back at Dentist's: Sweden....â€

Blind housewife Gun Thoresson regained her vision

at 43 after being blind since the age of 20. She had

her dentist remove three heavily fil ed teeth.

When a pre-dental student at the age of 21 in

1981, David Harden developed rheumatoid arthritis.

The prescribed drug therapy gradual y became

Ineffective. His father and dentist, too, removed two

amalgam fil ings from one tooth and that was the

end of David's rheumatoid arthritis.

Roy Kupslnel, MD, suffered from severe headaches since the placing of his first

fil ings of mercury amalgam when he was about five years old. At age 55 he is now

headache-free for one year. He had 29 fil ings removed and replaced with composites,

ceramic plastic resin materials.

Faye Dores had crippling arthritis, colitis, fatigue and memory loss. At age 35, she

was told that she would soon be confined to a wheelchair for life. Faye had her dentist

check her mouth for mercury vapor. The level was so astronomical that, If she had been a

building, the Environmental Protection Agency would have had to condemn her and tear

her down. She had her mercury fil ings removed. In three weeks she threw away her cane,

her tremors stopped and the swel ing went out of her joints. She states that she is 95%

cured.

Nancy Yost of San Jose, California, was told by her doctors that she had multiple

sclerosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by tests and she was declared "incurable". She

had worked in the dental Industry and so knew about mercury toxicity. Her doctors had

told her to "get real" and not to expect too much out of life. In other words, give up.

As a last resort, she had her five mercury fil ings removed. She left the dentist's

office using a cane and leaning heavily on the arm of a friend. The next day she was able

to walk without a cane.

How could these disastrous situations have developed? Doesn't the Food and Drug

Administration protect us from such occurrences? Unfortunately, at least In the case of

dentistry, the answer is no. The ADA's dental division is stacked with people from the

American Dental Association who tel the ADA what to do where dental regulation is

concerned. There Is virtual y no medical input or basic science, such as toxicology,

represented on the ADA's dental board. So your health is in the hands of a bunch of

political dentists who know nothing about mercury toxicity. Perhaps this explains why the

ADA refused to be interviewed by 60 Minutes concerning the mercury amalgam Issue.



The dental silver-mercury amalgam has been in existence for 165 years. In the

United States in the 1840's, the American Society of Dental Surgeons required its

members to sign an agreement not to put amalgam in a patient's mouth. Members

violated their agreement, the Organization dissolved, and the American Dental



80

Association was born. Over 140 years ago some wise individuals realized the dangers of

the toxicity of amalgams which contain approximately 50% mercury.



Since then, the American Dental Association has been stonewal ing the issue of

mercury amalgam toxicity. In fact, until several years ago, the ADA said no vapor at al

was released from these fil ings. But when the public got wind of the fact that

mercury/silver fil ings can damage their health the ADA met the issue head on. It denied

that there was any danger and started persecuting (and prosecuting) dentists who strayed

from the party line.



Dentists have been taught that mercury stays within a filling and does not come

out.

If mercury stays tightly bound in the amalgam compound as dentists are taught

then five-or-ten year-old-fil ings would stil contain 50 percent mercury. They don't. Actual

tests show that they contain 25 to 35 percent mercury. Some 20-year-old fil ings have less

than 5 percent mercury. In 1979 researchers established that mercury does leach from

fil ed teeth. In fact, fil ings can be the largest single source of exposure to inorganic

mercury. The next step came when scientists showed that the escaped mercury winds up

in body tissues; autopsies at Sweden's Karol nksa Institute found in 1987 that some

people with silver fil ings had three times as much mercury in their brain, and nine times

as much In their kidneys, for Instance, as those without fil ings.



Ask your dentist If the country of Sweden has banned mercury

amalgam fillings!!! He'll tell you they have. Ask your dentist if the

American Council on Dental Materials and Devices recommends that

dentists: 1) Avoid any contact with mercury, 2) Handle It only In

tightly sealed containers, and 3) Perform annual mercury-level tests

on their staff and themselves. He'll tell you they have.



Dr. Heber Simmons, Consumer Adviser for the American Dental Association, was

asked by Morley Safer, "You concede that there is a constant release of mercury vapor

(from amalgam fil ings)?"

"Oh, we don't dispute that at al . (Remember, the ADA'S position til seven years

ago was to total y deny any vapor release.) But the amount that Is being released when

you chew is such a smal amount that it Is not going to cause a problem."

When asked to explain the remarkable recoveries we described earlier, Simmons

reported that the cases were anecdotal and clinical y insignificant.



WHAT ARE DENTAL AMALGAM MADE OF?



Although we refer to our fil ings as "silver", amalgam Is actual y made up of about

52 percent mercury, with the remainder being copper, tin, silver, and zinc. There is a

wealth of scientific documentation proving that al five elements affect al the major organs

of the body, including the kidneys, liver, heart, central nervous system, and Immune

system. The five metals contained in the amalgam can combine to produce some 16

different corrosion products, al floating around in the body with unknown effects.





81

RECOMMENDATION



Since dental amalgam contains approximately 50% by weight of mercury (a

substance that is highly toxic to humans) and since the workshop failed to provide

evidence to substantiate the safety of dental" amalgam, the International Academy of Oral

Medicine and Toxicology recommends the fol owing:

"That the governments of the United States and Canada declare an Immediate

prohibition on the further use of dental silver-mercury fil ings until primary scientific

documentation can be provided proving that the mercury released from dental fil ings Is

not harmful to the public."

Without a doubt, mercury is extraordinarily toxic to humans. According to the

Toxicity Center at the University of Tennessee, which rates poisons for their lethal toxicity

to humans scores mercury at 1,600, compared to Plutonium, the deadliest, at 1,900. This

rating places It among the most toxic substances known to man.

Mercury is more poisonous than lead, cadmium or arsenic. Yet, no dentist would

dream of packing your teeth with lead or arsenic. Inhaled mercury vapor is at least a

hundred times more toxic than swal owed mercury. Mercury vapor is what comes off your

teeth from the fil ings when you chew your food. This occurs multiple times a day every

time you eat or grind your teeth together. Also, a battery-like effect, resulting from two

metal fil ings touching each other, can cause a continuous release of mercury vapor into

your mouth.



Don't let your dentist reassure you with a blood-level test for mercury.

The test is not reliable and tells you nothing about the amount of

mercury that your body has stored over the years.



DENTAL AMALGAM KILLS FOUR





It was late August, 1989. The place was Michigan. Four people; two men and two

women who had lived in a private home, lay dead.

Just over three weeks before, they were hospitalized, complaining of chest pain,

diarrhea, nausea and shortness of breath. Their breathing became more labored and

difficult. Four days into their hospital stay, it was learned that one of the men living in the

house had been col ecting mercury amalgam dental fil ings. He had been heating up the

fil ings in the basement in order to extract the smal amount of silver in them to sel .

Aggressive medical procedures to remove mercury from their bodies along with

substantial respiratory support were initiated, but to no avail. Al four people died of

mercury poisoning.

The house in which the amalgam was heated was extensively cleaned in the hopes

of removing the mercury. The cleaning failed and the contaminated house was declared

unfit for habitation and had to be torn down. According to environmental guidelines, the

mercury laden rubble was disposed of as hazardous waste.

These unfortunate victims died from breathing mercury vapor from the identical kind

of fil ings that are In 200 mil ion Americans' teeth. It is estimated that 100 mil ion new

amalgam-fil ings containing mercury are placed In teeth each year in the U.S.

I am aware of no other material except mercury amalgam that is implanted daily in

our bodies by medicine or dentistry that can contaminate whole buildings and kil people

simply by being heated.

Even The World Health organization concedes that the public's highest daily

exposure to mercury comes from dental amalgam fillings.



MERCURY DISTRIBUTION



From the amalgams, mercury vapors may be breathed into the lungs then absorbed

by the bloodstream. The mercury particles and ions may be swal owed and absorbed from

the gastrointestinal tract into the circulatory system. Now, it may travel to just about any

and every tissue, organ and cel . Mercury's target organs are kidneys, cardiac muscle,

lungs, liver, brain, and red blood cel s. Others are thyroid, pituitary, adrenals, spleen,

testes, ovaries, bone marrow, skeletal muscle, and Intestines.

There's very strong evidence that mercury in ' dental fil ings can cause a broad

spectrum of symptoms and diseases. Everything from depression to arthritis may be

involved in a particular case; it's extremely variable. Mercury poisoning has been

implicated in Alzheimer's disease, colitis, kidney disease, birth defects, brain damage, and

symptoms of multiple sclerosis.

As Dr. Alfred Zamm said on 60 Minutes "Doctors very rarely make a diagnosis of

mercury poisoning because of the difficulties of it. It has different faces. One (patient) has

headaches, one has tiredness, one has this, one has that. It's a very difficult diagnosis to

make especial y when it's micro-mercurialism in very smal amounts." Dr. Zamm Is an

al ergist and dermatologist and has reported hundreds of cases of patients who have

recovered from a variety of diseases after having their fil ings removed.



Dentists have double the number of brain tumors....



A study at Temple University, Philadelphia, showed that dentists....who work with

mercury fil ings al day long....have overwhelming evidence of mercury poisoning in the

form of high concentrations in the pituitary glands. The study also showed they had

double the number of brain tumors.

â€¢ Jack Levinson, president of the British Dental Society for Clinical Nutrition,

compiled studies showing that female dentists and personnel are 3 1/2 times more

likely to suffer sterility, stil -births, and miscarriages.

â€¢ Mercury linked to Multiple Sclerosis... The Journal of Epidemiology and

Community Health (Vol. 32, no. 155, 1978) and the Swedish Journal of Biological

Medicine (January 1989) have both shown an association between high mercury

levels and multiple sclerosis (MS). In the latter study, the mercury levels in MS

patients were on the average 7.5 times higher than in the control group- - those

without the disease.

â€¢ Mercury fillings weaken the immune system.... Mercury from amalgam fil ings

appears to lower T-lymphocyte cel s, which are among the most important

components of our Immune system. What's more, studies show that with removal

of mercury fil ings, T-cel levels increase dramatical y...and the patient's immune

system returns to normal. Dr. Hal Muggins, at the University of Colorado, has

measured T-cel rises of 100 percent to 300 percent after fil ings were removed.
