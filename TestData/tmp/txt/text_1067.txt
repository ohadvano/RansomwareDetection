He shushes me. “Just watch the movie.”
I try hard to concentrate on the movie, but all I can think about are Ryder's words.
We watch the whole movie in the same position without saying anything to each other. One thing for sure is that I won't be watching that movie ever again. I don't care if I'm paid to do it because that shit was fucked up.
The credits roll on the screen and I find this as a good chance to ask him about what he said earlier.
“Did you really mean what you said to Silver that you care for me?”
There's a long pause before he finally speaks. “I did mean it. Every single word.”
I face him and look into his eyes. “You're not lying to me, are you? I've had enough of people lying to me.”
He smiles gently. “I told you before that I'd never lie to you. All I'll ever give you is the truth.”
“Bullshit.” I say just as I attempt to get off the couch but stop when Ryder puts his hand on my hip.
