
normal is an unsafe time due to the fact that sperm can live up to 5 days.



If you want the absolute surest, most infallible form of natural birth control,

you only have an intimate relationship in the later part of the cycle (after the

rise in temperature for four consecutive days) until the time of the period. The

unsafe time being from the period to ovulation.





Note: Take your temperature within an hour of the same time each morning upon

awakening, If you sleep late, your temperature could show a false rise. Use a Basal

Thermometer, which measures in l/10th degrees instead of 2/10th degrees like a regular

thermometer. You should take your temperature rectal y or vaginal y rather than by mouth

because it is more accurate. A very important aspect of this method is keeping good

charts and records.



Herbs





Wild yam root contains diosgenin, used to manufacture progesterone. Most of the

steroid hormones used in modern medicine, especial y those in contraceptives, were

developed from elaborately processed chemical components. It is best to take this herb in

tea form, one glass just before bed each night. Use distil ed water or reverse-osmosis

water, bring to a boil, remove from stove, add 1 - 2 teaspoons of the herb and let steep for

20 minutes or longer.

OVERWEIGHT





Sixty-two percent of the American people are overweight -

that is more than one out of every two people in the United States!

Since intemperance in eating is such a major problem, I feel

compel ed to write about it. After twenty years of dieting, says a

national survey, the average American is now five pounds heavier.

The American Seating Company, one of the world's leading chair

manufacturers, has widened their standard seats by two inches to

accommodate the ever expanding American.





People are concerned about their weight. According to a

recent survey commissioned by the Calorie Control Council, 40 -

50 percent of those between the ages of 35 and 59 years old were

dieting. There is a difference between being overweight and being obese. If you can pinch

an inch of fat at your lower rib, you are overweight; and you are obese if you are 20% or

more overweight.



For every extra pound of weight, you shorten your lifespan by one month; so

someone who is 24 pounds overweight would die 2 years sooner. If you are obese, you

have a three times greater chance of having heart disease, are five times more likely to

develop diabetes, and are more likely to develop osteoarthritis and low back pain. You are

also more likely to develop cancer of the colon, breast, prostrate, cervix, uterus, and

ovaries. As the statistics plainly show, being twenty percent or more overweight, wil not

produce good health.



The reason that 62% of the people in this country are overweight is because of our

traditional eating habits. Americans eat a hearty breakfast, a hearty lunch, a hearty dinner,

and snack the rest of the time. Far more time is spent appropriating than eliminating, so

we carry around much excess fat.



Mankind believes that he can put large amounts of natural or unnatural foods into

his body and not have to take the blame for the sickness he brings upon himself by his

own improper choices.



If we eat three meals a day, we should have three eliminations a day. When natural

elimination is made difficult, then a special method for cleansing the body of these toxic

wastes is put into action, through sneezing, colds, discharges from the nose & eyes,

sores, and skin diseases of many kinds, such as pimples, boils, abscesses and ulcers.



Poor eating habits, and the taking of drugs, prevent or hinder our body from

keeping our system clean. Many of these toxins end up being stored in our bodies as fat,

or in our organs such as our kidneys as kidney stones, or in our gal bladder as gal stones;

or our arteries become plugged with arterial plaques which can cause a heart attack or



154

stroke. Al of these diseases, and many more, are the result of improper eating which

causes a high toxic build-up in the body.



It is important to realize that the body fluids, which contribute to the life processes,

are al alkaline except for the gastric juice;, and that the waste fluids are al acid, such as

the urine, perspiration, etc.. These acid products must be eliminated because the healthy

state of the body is one of alkalinity. If the tissues of the body become acid, il ness occurs.

This toxic acid build up in the body is the result of eating too many concentrated foods.

Ideal y, we should be eating a diet that consists of 80% alkaline forming foods, 20% acid

forming foods, as wel as a limited amount of high concentration foods (i.e. those

containing low water content).





First, let's look at some foods that are acid forming: meat, eggs, al grains (except

mil et and buckwheat), and al nuts (except almonds and brazil nuts). These foods should

make up 20% of our diet, except for the meat and eggs, which we should not use. The

other 80% of our diet should be made up of al alkaline-forming foods, which are fresh

fruits and vegetables. Concentrated foods (those with low or no water content) should be

eaten in limited amounts, whereas fresh fruits and vegetables have a high water content

and can be eaten in large amounts. Since our bodies are composed of a high percentage

of water, then we need to eat large amounts of fruits and vegetables which are also a high

percentage of water. This water in the food we eat transports the nutrients in the food to

al the body's cel s, and in turn removes toxic wastes.



So we see then that for optimum health we need to be eating meals that consist

largely (80%) of fruits and vegetables, and 20% of acid forming foods such as grains and

nuts; and that the concentrated foods (foods low in water) should be eaten in limited

amounts. As you eat more natural fresh foods, your caloric intake wil become less, but yet

you wil feel ful . For example, one apple has 80 calories, is 83% water, and is alkaline, as

opposed to l/6th of an apple pie, which has 405 calories, is quite low in water content, and

is both alkaline (apples) and acid (the crust). If we fol ow these guidelines, our

eliminations, in time, wil become normal, our body wil be able to get rid of the large

amounts of excess weight and toxins, and we wil start feeling great and losing weight.



So far, we have looked only at the physical disadvantages of being overweight; but

what about the mental disadvantages. Overweight or obese persons, as a general rule,

are insecure; they don't feel accepted because of their weight. They are not happy

inwardly, even though many try to put on an outward show. They are not as ambitious

when it involves physical activities. They are not happy with themselves because of their

weight problems; and consequently they usual y are not happy with others. They also tend

to be highly emotional; and most are unable to control their tempers.



These are just a few of the mental disadvantages associated with being overweight

or obese. I personal y believe that through the power of prayer, and fol owing God, a

person can get the victory and wil become temperate in their appetite; and this wil

change them spiritual y, mental y, and physical y. Then they can be the happy, healthy

person God has always wanted them to be.

It takes wil power and determination with God's help, to overcome appetite. Just

like any other habit you want to overcome, you must plan your strategy so you wil not fal

again and again and again. What can I do when those hunger pangs strike and I am

tempted to be intemperate? Drinking a glass of water can displace cravings for food.

Since dehydration encourages cravings for food, it is vital to consume adequate water

every day. You wil find that if you drink your water quota between meals (a minimum of

eight (8) glasses daily, you wil feel satisfied and be less likely to crave food between

meals.





Because exercise helps to curb hunger, taking a brisk walk outside in the fresh air

is an excel ent aid. During working hours or whenever time is limited, even a few minutes

spent deeply breathing fresh air can rejuvenate you and take your mind off food. Diversion

tactics are also helpful, such as going to visit a friend, working in the garden, or shopping.





First of al , exercising in the morning increases the body's metabolism, causing the
