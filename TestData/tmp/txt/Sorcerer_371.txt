Kiran’s face lit up gloriously, and he went and caressed her rump, giving it soft kisses. He licked the excess wetness from between her ass and buried his face in it. 
“Hurry up,” said Gatril. 
“Y-Yeah.” Kiran stooped, leveling his waist with her bottom. Gatril bent her tail over her back to allow him ease of access. Kiran pulled back the foreskin of his manhood and bumped the tip against Gatril, feeling her muscles tense just a little.
“Slowly now,” Gatril giggled. “You might hurt yourself.”
Kiran slowly entered her, feeling the squeeze of Gatril’s warm wetness. He winced and moaned softly. 
“Good work,” said Gatril. “You’re no longer a virgin. Now, start pounding. Slowly.”
Kiran cocked back his hip and swung inward, delivering his first thrust; a brief burst of sweetness. Kiran continued to do so until Gatril sunk into the flow of things, closing her eyes and moaning along with her human consort.
As the minutes passed, Kiran increased his speed and power. Both he and Gatril winced and clenched their fists.
“That’s it!” she said. “Faster…faster…”
Kiran closed his eyes as his moans grew louder, and before he knew it, he pulled out, spurting a thick jet of white fluid over Gatril’s head and onto the wall. He let out a deep, long sigh. Kiran’s body shuddered spasmodically. The painful throbs had become pleasurable contractions that dripped his semen each time.
Gatril lay on her chest and crossed her arms beneath her head. Kiran staggered to his feet, careful not to trip over his belongings. He sat back against the wall and wiped the tip of his penis, folding it back into his pants. “That was amazing!”
Gatril lifted her head, rolled on her back and sat up. “Not bad for your first time. Especially your tongue.”
Kiran blushed and looked away. “A few prostitutes live near me. They used to talk about how they like it to be done.”
“Really?” Gatril laughed. “I can’t believe it. Just word of mouth thought you? You’re a really good listener.”
Kiran got up, looking down at Gatril as if he knew her all along. “So,” Kiran was a bit hesitant with his words, “what does this make us now?”
“Hmm. Let’s just leave it at friends with benefits,” said Gatril.
Kiran nodded. “Yeah. Sure.” He looked around at the floor. “Well, I better start working on my spell now.”
While Gatril wiped herself, Kiran took the bowl and poured its contents into a clear jar. He took up two other jars and fetched the spell book. Along with the vaginal fluids of a bosdrake, he needed a little sulphur and powdered mango seed. Once he got the substances together, Kiran mixed them around in the jar.
Gatril sat and watched Kiran at work, wondering who his grandfather was, and also about Kiran’s profession and future. Not many beasts had the opportunity to see the intricacies of how humans developed their society.
When the queex began to take on a gelatinous form, Kiran took it out of the jar and placed it in his hands. He rolled it together until it hardened into a white, discolored orb.
“Got it!” Kiran said.
“What will you do with that?” said Gatril.
“Just watch…” Kiran’s movements were bouncy. He took up his staff and quickly carved a space at the top that he filled with glue. He placed the orb into it and waited for it to dry.
Kiran sprung to his feet, his pants still stained with semen and vaginal fluids. “It’s ready!”
Gatril got up. “Good. Now we can see what all that sex was for.”
Gatril followed him outside, squinting a little from the sunlight. Kiran looked around and found a large stone. He summoned forth his spirit energy and channeled it into the staff. “Okay Gatril, watch closely.”
“I am you little rascal,” she said.
Kiran tossed the rock. As the object fell, he channeled his energy into the orb in the staff. A shockwave snapped from it and hit the rock, sending it flying into the bushes like a missile. Kiran leaped and punched the air. “Yes! It worked!”
Smiling, Gatril said, “Congratulations.” She scratched her cheek. “What the hell was that anyway?”
Kiran said, “It was a basic force-counter spell. It produces a blast of kinetic energy that can repel objects of a certain size. Anything the size of a man will be sent flying.”
“Neat trick,” she said. Gatril swayed her tail as she assessed the situation. “So this competition that you’re going to enter, what else does it have?”
Kiran proudly stood with the staff before him like a cane. “We’re supposed to complete three trials, then face off against each other in the finals. The successful ten contestants will be chosen to serve on the Grand Magic Council, or as aids to nobles and the king. I need to create five spells, so I need the queex of five beasts.”
Gatril frowned. “Five beasts? Their queex? Really? Are you sure it’s not just an excuse for you to have sex with beasts?
Kiran dropped his staff and franticly waved his hands. “No! No! I swear!” He pointed back into the hut. “The spells I want require those specific parts! Honest!”
Gatril narrowed her emerald eyes at the human. “Hmmm. And you say I was the first?”
