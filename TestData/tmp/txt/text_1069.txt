After everything with Terry, I just want to be in Ryder's arms. I lean into him and wrap my arms around his neck. “I just want to forget for awhile, but I want this Ryder.
Please.” I find his neck and lightly place kisses on his skin. He doesn't stop me.
I can tell by looking at him that his self-control won't last long, and with those words being said it gives him the go ahead that he needs.
He stands from the couch and wraps my legs around his waist. He carries me effortlessly up the stairs and into his room, kicking the door closed on his way in.
He places me gently on his bed, stands between my legs and smiles down at me. “Has anyone ever told you that you're beautiful?”
I giggle. “I've been told several times in fact by my mother.” I tease.
He leans down and brushes his lips against mine. “Don't tease me.” He kisses me hard, but it's not enough.
I pull his body down towards mine; running my fingers along the length of his back and grab the end of his white wife-beater, making it obvious what I want him to do. He leans back, yanks his vest over his head and helps to take off my shirt too. His lips lower to touch mine and I can feel that he's growing impatient and when his fingers wander where no boy has ever touched before, I gasp. The sound of him growling gives me a feeling of empowerment.
I run my hands up and down his chest; craving that feeling of having his skin underneath my fingertips. When my hands touch his jeans, it's like my hands have a mind of their own, and they rush to unbuckle his belt.
