“Trust me,” said Gatril, “someone like you wouldn’t have much to fear. You just need to mark out your own territory. You can even stay with me if you wan to.”
“Really…?” Shirksire said, half rising from her seat. 
“Of course,” said Gatril. “I’m close to where Kiran lives. He can always visit us.”
Then Shirksire’s elation dwindled when she realized something. “…But my books…There are a lot of them.”
“If you’ve ready read them, then you don’t need them anymore,” said Kiran. “If you were trying to learn magic, they obviously weren’t helpful.”
Shirksire smiled. “Your offer does sound tempting. I must considerate, though.”
“No problem,” said Kiran, getting up. “Now let’s see if this works…”
Kiran channeled his spirit energy into the staff and pointed to the gun next to Gatril. A thick strand of silk spewed from the orb and attached to the weapon, and Karin yanked it towards him and caught it.
“A web…” Shirksire remarked.
“Just in case I can’t reach something from where I am,” said Kiran. “So, shall we all leave? This cave is getting a bit cramped now.”
Shirksire got up. “Right this way…”
Shirksire lead them to out of the cave into the ruins of the town, where the male spiders awaiting them, peering from atop the buildings and inside through the windows. However, any thoughts of making an attack on the human and bosdrake where stalled by the presence of their female.
“What will you do about them?” said Gatril as she walked by the arachnids.
“I’ll still keep them around as a deterrent from travelers,” Shirksire said, watching Kiran hurry towards his quacycle and check for any damages. 
The sun was setting in the distance, and long shadows were strewn from the trees across the ground. The air was cool, and Kiran felt relaxed now that his entire mission was complete. When they were out on the highway, Kiran and Gatril faced Shirksire, about to say their final goodbyes.
“When will you be back?” said Shirksire.
“Within a month’s time, after the tournament is finished,” said Kiran. “If I get my sorcerer’s license, I can keep beasts…or ferrans as my pets. In this case, you would be my partner. It means you could walk amongst human’s freely without any persecution. Then we can study new magic together.”
Shirksire smiled. “I like the sound of that.” She knelt over Kiran, held his cheeks and kissed him on his forehead. “I’ll be seeing you, Kiran…”
“You too, Shirksire,” said the young man.
“We should get going,” said Gatril. “bultungins usually get active at night. And we already pissed off a gang of them.”
Kiran and Gatril got on the quacycle and rode off, while Shirksire walked back to the town. 
“Well,” said Gatril, “you’ve acquired all your spells, young sorcerer. I guess you only need to prepare for your grand debut at the tournament.”
Kiran said, “Yeah, but that’s only the first part. After that I’ll need to raise money doing a lot of missions. I still remember my promise to carry you to Puzzland. And I want to discover different magical artifacts on the uncharted continents.”
Gatril’s arms slinked around Kiran affectionately. “Do you think we can say we are boyfriend and girlfriend now?”
“That’s if you mind sharing,” said Kiran. “The uncharted worlds are really dangerous, so I’ll need as much support as I can get. I think I really will each Shirksire how to use magic. Heck, maybe all the other girls can join me.”
“So long as you eat my crotch the most, I don’t mind,” said Gatril.
Kiran looked over his shoulder at Gatril, and said, “Don’t worry, you’ll always be my main girl.”
Gatril’s mouth was slightly ajar, and she closed it. She smiled at Kiran and kissed his cheek. 
Kiran turned his attention back to the road, grinning. Have I got a story for you, grandpa.
