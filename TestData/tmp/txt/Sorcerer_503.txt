“Wait,” she said. “before you go…at least know my name. I’m not a whore for a human to mount and leave.”
Kiran said, “Okay… What is your name?”
“Kundis,” she said. “That is the name I choose to go by.”
Kiran nodded. “Kundis. That’s a nice name.”
Kundis didn’t smile at the compliment, but simply said. “I need to rebuild my nest. Good night, Kiran.” And she turned and went into the trees.
Kiran held Gatril’s hand. “Come on. Let’s go back.”

After Kiran returned to the cottage and reported the news to Eyeka and the selkies, he was given their gratitude, which was enough for him, even though Gatril urged him to ask her for her queex.
The pair snuck back to the inn under the cover of night. Kiran had himself a bath in the shower, as Gatril had already cleaned herself in the river. When Kiran returned to his room he relaxed in the bed next to Gatril, both naked. There was no arousal amongst them, but they enjoyed the warmth of each other.
It was in the middle of the night when Kiran was awakened to Gatril munching on some meat in the corner of the room. He rubbed the stagnation out of his eyes and said, “Late night snack?”
“Well, I can’t exactly go downstairs,” she said, taking another bite of her jaguar meat.
Kiran chuckled and rolled out of the covers. He put on his underpants, ran his hands through his dreadlocks and went over to the wardrobe where he had his things. “I might as well work on the spell while I’m up.”
Kiran took out the jar of queex along with a paper containing fish scales and powdered aquamarine stone. He sat on the floor before Gatril, sneaking glances at her as he worked. 
“Is something wrong?” said Gatril.
“I was just thinking,” Kiran said as he poured the powder and fish scales into the jar, “why did you really come with me; a human?”
Gatril said, “You still don’t trust me?”
“No, I do trust you,” Kiran said. “I just find it strange that a beast would want to go on an adventure with a human. Don’t you have any beast friends?”
Gatril shook her head. “There aren’t many where I’m from.”
Kiran said, “I heard there aren’t many bosdrakes left in Aardel. Do you ever got lonely not being around others like you?”
“…Sometimes,” Gatril said. She stared out the window at the luminous moon. “I don’t even know where my family is. Our kind usually scatters once we grow older, tending to live by ourselves. We like our own territory, but…sometimes company can be nice.”
Kiran had finished rolling the substance into a green-blue sphere and put it in his staff below the white orb. He tapped the staff once and put it down, giving Gatril his attention. “Well, I’m here with you. And I’m really glad you’re with me, helping me out.”
Gatril turned to Kiran and smiled. “Yes. So am I.”

CHAPTER FOUR

Kiran and Gatril woke early the next morning to continue their journey. 
Kiran brushed his teeth and went to the kitchen to get them breakfast, returning with two plates dumplings, chopped pumpkins and stewed beef. 
After their meal Kiran gathered his things and went outside to his quacycle, then rode around the back of the inn where Gatril leaped over the fence to meet him. She wore her cloak to conceal her appearance. The bosdrake hopped onto the human’s quacycle, and together they rode out of Wopol and onto the main road.
“The popobawa,” said Gatril. “These are forest creatures, right?”
“Yeah,” said Kiran. “They’re a bit dangerous too. They come out at night to feed on blood. But they disguise themselves as humans in the day time.”
“They also have good agility, I heard,” Gatril said, “I’m not very good with flying foes either, and I still haven’t fully recovered from our fight with Kundis.”
“We can camp and rest when night falls,” said Kiran. “I heard reports of a popobawa in a forest near Dehafi Town. That’s three miles from here.”
“Okay, boss man,” said Gatril. 
Their journey took them around a small hillside that overlooked a vast plain and mountains in the distance, where the morning became brighter and warmer. Just beyond the mountains in the east lay the country of Gobanyi, where Kiran knew young magical practitioners like himself were prepare for the Witching Tournament. It got him wondering how well his spells would fare against the techniques of the others.
Of course I’ll do fine, he thought. I’m going through so much trouble to get rare spells after all.
