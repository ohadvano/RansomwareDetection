Kiran took out the jar of queex along with a paper containing fish scales and powdered aquamarine stone. He sat on the floor before Gatril, sneaking glances at her as he worked. 
“Is something wrong?” said Gatril.
“I was just thinking,” Kiran said as he poured the powder and fish scales into the jar, “why did you really come with me; a human?”
Gatril said, “You still don’t trust me?”
“No, I do trust you,” Kiran said. “I just find it strange that a beast would want to go on an adventure with a human. Don’t you have any beast friends?”
Gatril shook her head. “There aren’t many where I’m from.”
Kiran said, “I heard there aren’t many bosdrakes left in Aardel. Do you ever got lonely not being around others like you?”
“…Sometimes,” Gatril said. She stared out the window at the luminous moon. “I don’t even know where my family is. Our kind usually scatters once we grow older, tending to live by ourselves. We like our own territory, but…sometimes company can be nice.”
Kiran had finished rolling the substance into a green-blue sphere and put it in his staff below the white orb. He tapped the staff once and put it down, giving Gatril his attention. “Well, I’m here with you. And I’m really glad you’re with me, helping me out.”
Gatril turned to Kiran and smiled. “Yes. So am I.”

CHAPTER FOUR

Kiran and Gatril woke early the next morning to continue their journey. 
Kiran brushed his teeth and went to the kitchen to get them breakfast, returning with two plates dumplings, chopped pumpkins and stewed beef. 
After their meal Kiran gathered his things and went outside to his quacycle, then rode around the back of the inn where Gatril leaped over the fence to meet him. She wore her cloak to conceal her appearance. The bosdrake hopped onto the human’s quacycle, and together they rode out of Wopol and onto the main road.
“The popobawa,” said Gatril. “These are forest creatures, right?”
“Yeah,” said Kiran. “They’re a bit dangerous too. They come out at night to feed on blood. But they disguise themselves as humans in the day time.”
“They also have good agility, I heard,” Gatril said, “I’m not very good with flying foes either, and I still haven’t fully recovered from our fight with Kundis.”
“We can camp and rest when night falls,” said Kiran. “I heard reports of a popobawa in a forest near Dehafi Town. That’s three miles from here.”
“Okay, boss man,” said Gatril. 
Their journey took them around a small hillside that overlooked a vast plain and mountains in the distance, where the morning became brighter and warmer. Just beyond the mountains in the east lay the country of Gobanyi, where Kiran knew young magical practitioners like himself were prepare for the Witching Tournament. It got him wondering how well his spells would fare against the techniques of the others.
Of course I’ll do fine, he thought. I’m going through so much trouble to get rare spells after all.
As they descend onto flat grassland, the town of Dehafi rose into view. Its most dominant features were pillars of black smoke spewing from the factories. The distance between the town and the human-bosdrake pair was occupied by scattered trees that loomed over the swaying grass, grass being tended to by grazing gazelles and zebras.
Kiran and Gatril weren’t looking out for anything out of the ordinary, concerned only with reaching the town, yet something amongst the animals managed to snag their attention.
“Whoa, what’s that over there?” said Gatril.
“Huh?” Kiran parked his quacycle along the road. He looked in the direction Gatril gestured to, and spotted someone in a dusty robe kneeling next to one of the zebras. “Who is that?”
“There’s only one way to find out if you really want to know,” said Gatril.
Kiran turned off the engine and he and Gatril got off the vehicle. They made their way through the grass, kicking up bugs with each step. Some of the animals scattered but the one the person was next to didn’t budge an inch. And when they got close enough, they saw what was really happening.
The stranger was a woman. She wore a red tunic and a shiny, green fabric wrapped around her waist and draped over her shoulder. Kiran recognized it as a sari, and coupled with the woman’s brown skin and black, straight her, he deduced her origins as a Gabanyese from the neighboring country.
But it was what she was doing rather than her nationality that captivated Gatril and him.
The zebra’s penis was fully erect, which the woman stroked and sucked on fiercely with slurping sounds and lots of froth.
“Wow, she’s really working it,” said Gatril.
Kiran looked at her indifferently. He was not disgusted in the sense of the word, but he didn’t fancy sexual activity with animals. What differentiated beasts from animals was the fact that they had human intelligence and at least human-like features; breasts and genitals shaped like that of a human female. 
“Excuse me, lady?” Kiran said.
