“You know, I think what would be better is if I shift on my own without having anyone around. I want to be able to shift on my own without having an audience. I think she'll attack you guys if you surround her. She might think it's a threat, and I don't want anyone to get hurt because of me.”
“Fine. We'll do it your way, but as part of teaching your new abilities, I want you to come and find me.” Ryder winks at me just before he slides down his blue jeans along with his briefs.
Maybe I should have turned away when I had the chance because that image will forever be inside my head.
When I try to gather my thoughts after seeing Ryder's
naked body, I turn to see that Kellan and Bane have shifted already and started to run into the woods. I look back at Ryder when I find that I can't contain my breathing. The view right in front of me suddenly feels unrealistic.
He stands twice the size he was just now, I'd need to stretch my whole arm upwards to be able to touch his snout. He lowers his head as if he's studying me very carefully, and he probably recognizes my scent from before when I attacked him in Sam's house. I don't move a single muscle in case any kind of movement will aggravate the Alpha standing fearless in front of me.
A few minutes go by with him just staring intensely at me, a part of me is scared of what this beast might do to me, but I know Ryder wouldn't hurt me on purpose. Ryder takes one more look at me, turns around and follows the same footprints as Bane and Kellan.
I let out a breath of relief when Ryder's form disappears but I'm left feeling lost with what to do next.
I was told to keep calm but how can I when my heart is racing?
