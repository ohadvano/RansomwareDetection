I kiss him again. “Nope.”
He kisses me back and we both leave for class.
As I make my way towards English and round the corner, I see my best friend waiting casually outside the classroom. I call her name to see her looking not so impressed with me. “You know, best friends usually call or text each other on the weekends, but nothing from you. I may have to find another best friend.”
I run my hand through my hair. “I know, I'm such a terrible person. It was quite a weekend.”
Maybe now's not the time to say what happened to Terry.
She peers at me and inspects me from head to toe. “You sure seem different.”
Did it have it written on my forehead that I slept with Ryder or something?
The last time Sam and I spoke was at my house after bringing Max there from the party, and she didn't seem happy with me at all and we never argue, but you see with Sam, she forgives and forgets a lot quicker than most teenaged girls.
“I look different?”
