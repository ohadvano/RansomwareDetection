“Yes, but if I hadn't have been bitten, you probably wouldn't even be standing here, right?”
He looks away from me. “Probably not.” He lets go of my hand.
I nod in dismay. “You're unbelievable, you know that?”
He looks at me and frowns. “What do you want me to say, Alice?”
“I want you to say that you didn't care about me when I was a human!?”
“Alice..”
“You didn't, did you? The moment you started caring for me was when it turned out that I was an Alpha too.”
He cups my cheek. “That's not true. I always kept my distance from you. That Monday at school when I could sense another wolf, it finally gave me an excuse to interact with you. It's given me the chance to show you this new gift that you've been given. The bite is a gift, it gives you the ability to hear and smell things that no ordinary person can. Who wouldn't want that?”
I remove his hold on my cheek. “I don't want it and I never will want it either.”
