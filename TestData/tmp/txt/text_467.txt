“He's gonna do what!?”
I march to keep up with his long strides while he laughs at me. “How is he gonna do that if she can't stand him!?”
From out of nowhere, I feel somebody walking behind me, I turn around and smack right into Ryder's bare chest - who wears nothing other than blue jeans.
Why all of a sudden was everyone half naked?
“If she submits to me then I won't have to fight or hurt her for dominance which I shouldn't have to do anyway.”
He leaves with Kellan through a door at the back of the house where it leads out to the garden. I quickly have a look at the house and notice the white walls completely bare of any pictures or memories of either one of the wolves, and it makes me feel quite unhappy. Happy or sad, everyone should have pictures up on the wall. Now that I think about it, maybe I don't know these people as well as I thought I did.
I stand in a big archway that gives the view of the living area that I didn't see last night. I was so oblivious last night that I didn't see the beauty of this room, I feel downhearted that I missed seeing what I'm looking at now. The living area is enormous and by enormous I mean I could fit my kitchen and living room in this space. A large television takes up the whole wall on one side of the room with all sorts of consoles placed neatly on the floor. Potted plants are placed on either side of a glass desk with an expensive looking laptop left untouched. Two black sofas are placed on either side of each other with a black coffee table sitting between them, but what draws my attention is the white marble fireplace placed at the back of the room with flames already ignited. A sheepskin rug lying in front of the fireplace - making it look so tempting to lie on right this second.
I jerk in surprise when I hear my name being called from outside and rush to catch up with everyone. The moment I step out I see that all the wolves have gathered outside; waiting for me presumably.
Bane stands with his arms crossed over his chest with a bored look on his face.
