Kellan places his hands gently on my shoulders, “Alice, I advise you to think about Ryder's offer. You won't survive on your own.”
I take his hands away from me. “I can take care of myself.”
I walk towards my front door hoping they get the idea that I want them to leave. Kellan leaves first without a word, Bane follows with an expressionless look on his face while Ryder meets me by the door with a scowl on his face.
“Why don't you ever listen?” He crosses his arms over his chest.
“What?”
“You never listen to anything anyone ever tells you. I'm trying to help you! You have no idea what's coming to you! Have you thought about what this change might do to you? What about your mother? How is she gonna cope?”
“Stop it! I'm sick of you acting like you're already my Alpha! I don't want to be in your pack! So, stick your offer and shove it up your ass!”
“Alice!”
I turn to look outside to see my mother standing in the drive.
