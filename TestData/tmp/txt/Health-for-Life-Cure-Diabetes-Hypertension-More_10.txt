Sun baths improve our general health, stimulate the appetite, give a feeling of wel -

being, and enable us to sleep at night. Next time you're under stress, go out for a walk in

the sunshine and watch what it wil do for you. Those who take advantage of the weather

by sunbathing find that the sun definitely has a tranquilizing effect, more than the effect

one obtains from just lying down and relaxing or resting. In a study done at the University

of Il inois the effects of sunlight treatments on Student behavior were

observed.



The students who were given the sunlight treatments showed

greater interest in their class work, attended classes more regularly and

felt more wide awake during the day. They voted unanimously to

continue sunlight treatments fol owing the experiment. It has been

shown that sunlight treatments actual y affect the brain and can help

balance the nerve impulses. Sunlight can alter the flow of hydrochloric

acid, which may be the reason stomach and duodenal ulcers respond

so favorably to light therapy. The adrenal glands contain more adrenaline fol owing

sunlight treatments, and this may account for one's increased ability to withstand stress

after such treatments. It has been shown that in certain areas where one has a limited

amount of sunshine, such as Alaska in the winter, there is a higher rate of suicides. For

Optimum health, live in a home that is located on high dry ground with plenty of Windows

and with shade trees kept far enough from the home to let in plenty of sunshine.

When the sun is permitted to shine on the skin it quickly Stores up a tremendous

amount of energy in the body. Mil ions of nerve endings absorb the radiant energy of the

sun and transmit this energy to the entire nervous System of the body. That is why one

feels so ful of energy and life after a sun bath. Generous amounts of sunshine do give

one a cheerful sunny disposition. Clients that I work with often comment on how great they

feel after a series of sunbaths.

SUNBATHING

A sunbath is best taken in the morning when the air is clear,

and the heat not too great. In the summer it may be taken as

early as eight o'clock. In cool weather, it may be taken later in

the forenoon. Care must be taken to prevent overheating or

chil ing. In order to avoid a sunburn it is necessary to start with

a short exposure and to increase the time gradual y on

fol owing days. The ultraviolet light is the light that has proven

to be the most health restoring. Unfortunately, it is also one

that is most easily eliminated by window glass, sunglasses or

clothing. The most important part of our body that the sun's ultraviolet rays need to reach

is our eyes. Sunglasses and regular glasses wil not let the ultraviolet rays (the healing

rays of the sun) reach the eyes. So, when you are sunbathing use no glasses-just close

your eyes and look at the sun with your eyes closed so the ultraviolet rays can penetrate

the eye lids. It would be good to do this a minimum of 10 minutes each day. This is

especial y good for women with a hormonal imbalance (during their monthly cycle), and

anyone with a nervous disorder. During sun bathing the amount of ultraviolet light

available depends upon the location of the earth and the season. The more atmosphere

the ultraviolet light must pass through the less there wil be to reach the earth. In the

winter there is less ultraviolet light available as the northern hemisphere is tilted away from

the sun; so the best time to sunbathe is between 10 AM and 2 PM. In the summer

ultraviolet light is available over a longer period of time, so it is best to sunbathe between

8 AM and 4 PM.





SUNBURN

During the sunbath you should feel good. There should be no feeling of depression or

discomfort. If, as a result of exposure to the sun, you feel weak, too warm, or there are

signs of headache, stop at once. The degree of injury to the skin depends on the

concentration of ultraviolet rays, the duration of the exposure, and the amount of pigment

within the skin of the individual. Blondes and redheads are particularly susceptible. On

repeated exposure to sunlight, most persons develop an increased amount of pigment in

the skin (suntan) and thus become less susceptible to sunburn while the excess

pigmentation lasts. Drugs, cosmetics and soaps can so sensitize the skin that burning

becomes a real problem. One should not be afraid of sweating, as the sweating process

cools the body and eliminates toxins. One has to take into consideration, when

sunbathing, the time of day, location, season of the year, latitude and elevation. Sun

burning can take place faster in mile high Denver, Colorado, than it can at sea level, for

the sun's rays have a mile less of atmosphere through which to pass. If one is sunbathing

at the beach, he wil probably burn faster than on the back lawn. The amount of ultraviolet

light reflected from the environment can make a big difference. Snow wil reflect about

86% of the ultraviolet, dry sand 17% and grass 2.5%. Water is a poor reflector of

ultraviolet light.



Reflection of the sun's rays by a clear, blue sky overhead, may double the effect of

the ultraviolet rays which come from the sun itself. One other thing to remember is that

wet skin wil burn more rapidly than dry skin. While sunbathing, use no kind of lotions,

creams, sun screening agents, etc. Sunscreens containing a tanning ingredient may

promote skin cancer. Lyle Cartwright, M.D. of the University of California Medical Center

at San Diego, found tumors and skin changes in laboratory mice that had been covered



33

with the tanning ingredient and exposed to sunlight. The researchers reported that 100%

of the mice, having sunscreen applications and a dose of sunlight equal to one hour of

midday sun in a temperate climate, developed tumors. Mice, not treated with sunscreen,

but given large doses of sunshine, did not develop tumors. (American Medical News, June

24,1983, pg.18). Clean skin is the best for sunbathing. Natural sunshine is best for

sunbathing. There are no sun lamps made that can match our natural sun. Some are

different from the sunlight and may actual y be harmful. Light is a nutrient much like food;

and, like food, the wrong kind can make us il , and the right kind can keep us wel .





SUNSCREENS/TUMORS

Urocanic acid, found in sun screens, body lotions, foundations or make-up bases, may

trigger or stimulate growth of skin tumors. Laboratory animals exposed to sunlamps after

the applications of urocanic acid had four times more tumors than those not treated with

urocanic acid. (Medical Tribune, April 18, 1991)

What are natural foods? They are foods that are natural, such as apples, potatoes,

corn, almonds, etc. They have no added artificial flavorings, colors, or preservatives; and
