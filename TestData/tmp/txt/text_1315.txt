I approach the officer, stand next to Ryder and smile softly. “I'm Alice Smith.”
Tom takes in my whole appearance, moves to look at Ryder then at his own son. “Are you aware of what happened here today, Alice?”
I nod. “I am aware, yes. Terry was a good person.”
Tom looks at me as though I have piqued his curiosity. “You knew the victim?” He writes on his notepad.
“Yes, we worked together at the diner.” I can feel myself getting emotional just by talking about him.
“And were you and the victim	close?”
Ryder snarls. “What are you suggesting? That she was romantically involved with a guy that's old enough to be her dad?”
Ryder's words cause me to wince to which he notices straight away and looks at me apologetically.
I shake my head. “Terry was someone that I considered a very close friend of mine. He always kept to himself and he loved working at the diner. It was like his second home.” I wipe away a tear.
