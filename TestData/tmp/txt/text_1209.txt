Sam and I sit on her bed eating chocolates while watching Gossip Girl. Before we arrived at her house, I told her everything about Max and what he told me.
“Yeah, and I don't regret it either. Is that bad?”
Sam snorts. “Are you kidding me, he had it coming.”
“I just don't know who to believe.” I pick up a piece of chocolate and shove it in my mouth.
She shrugs. 'I mean, I can see where you're coming from. You've got Ryder who's an Alpha and has his own pack. We don't know what kind of pack they are and what they do or what they're capable of, but they don't really seem that bad. Yes, they might have anger issues but I've never heard or seen them beat up a random person before. As for Max, we have no idea who he is or his history. I mean we just met him yesterday, and he seems like a genuinely nice guy but again we don't really know him.” Sam turns the TV volume down. “We're at an impasse, Alice.”
I lie on my side and sigh. “It just doesn't make sense! Why would Max say that Ryder, Kellan and Bane beat him up? Unless Ryder's a good liar and he's brainwashed his pack to believing that they didn't do it.”
“Look, I think it's been a long day. We need to chill, not mention any boys and just watch Chuck Bass being sexy.”
“That sounds great, but I'm more of a Nate Archibald fan.”
After hours of watching episodes of Gossip Girl and eating piles of chocolate, we decide to turn in for an early night. I leave her room to go down the kitchen for a glass of milk, when I feel my head starting to pound. It's probably caused after the shouting and the stress of today.
