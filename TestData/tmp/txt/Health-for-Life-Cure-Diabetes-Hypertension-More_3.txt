

â€œShe can swim faster than anyone else in the country her age. She can swim faster

than most people far younger.â€



So wrote Pamela Livingston, staff writer for the Roswel Daily Record, Roswel ,

New Mexico, in the July 1, 1985, edition.



At 5â€™2â€ and 95 pounds, Catherine Cress is the fastest 75-79 year old breast stroke

swimmer in the United States.



In Milwaukee in the spring of 1985, she broke al the records of any previous

winners of 75 â€“ 79 year olds for the 50 yards, the 100 yards and the 200 yard breast

stroke. She has received al kinds of medals for swimming, recently and when she was a

15 to 20 year old girl.

How does Catherine Cress, now age 76, stay in shape to swim extraordinarily in

these meets? For the past 18 years, sheâ€™s been swimming one mile four to five mornings

a week. She says: â€œI never miss because I never get sick. For 25 years I havenâ€™t been to a



8

doctor.â€ Says Catherine: â€œI am 76 years young and so happy my body functions so

perfectly. Everyone I know my age and younger, al suffer from one thing or another and

take al kind of drugs.â€



Whatâ€™s Her Secret?





Catherine Cress has no secrets! Ask her and sheâ€™l tel you why sheâ€™s healthier than

her peers and most younger people. Sheâ€™l tel you why sheâ€™s in better shape than her

mother was at the same age. Not only does Mrs. Cress stay fit with regular exercise, but

â€œI gave up meat 15 years ago. I never eat sugar. Most of the time, I eat raw fruits and

vegetables and seeds and nuts.



â€œI belong to a food co-op and buy my fruits ad nuts there. People gobble up al

those vitamins. They ask me which ones I take. I say â€˜NOTHING!â€™â€.



To prove how healthy she is, Catherine told me: â€œLast night I slipped in water and

fel in the garage. I got up and wasnâ€™t even hurt. My bones must be strong.â€



For further proof of her unusual health, Mrs. Cress told me: â€œMy son is an oral

surgeon in Chicago. When he checks me, my blood pressure is always normal and my

temperature is only 97.2 degrees.



â€œIâ€™ve worn glasses since Iâ€™ve been 53 or 55. My family said, â€˜Get new glassesâ€™. I

said, â€˜I can stil see fine with these.â€™ I just want to stay healthy just as long as Iâ€™m living.â€

Introduction


When we mention living healthful y, many people groan. They immediately think of

tasteless food, rigid exercises, regimentation and unhappiness. This is not true; and this

book has been written to prove to you that true happiness is feeling good about yourself

because you are in control of what is happening to you.



Everybody wants to be happy, healthy and free from the threat of il ness and

disease. Every day countless numbers die from the dreaded cancer or from Aids, from

heart disease or from some other serious il ness. Al of these il nesses can be traced to

one source: failure to maintain a healthy immune system.



We al have within our bodies a certain number of germs, but the body has an

immune system to protect us from these germs. As long as our immune system is strong,

these germs cannot develop into ful blown, life-threatening diseases. However, if we do

not strengthen our immune system or if we weaken it by engaging in bad health habits,

then the disease germs multiply and we suffer. The secret to a healthy life then is to learn

how to strengthen and maintain a healthy immune system.



Many people visit our Center where we teach them how to strengthen their immune

system by eating properly, exercising and abstaining from putting harmful things in the

body system. Dozens of these clients have left us happier, healthier and free from

disease.



Margie is a classic example of what a healthful lifestyle can do to improve your

quality of life. She had suffered a toxemia pregnancy early in her marriage, leaving her

with chronic hypertension, which eventual y developed into a heart disease.



When she came to me, she was 30 pounds overweight and suffering from

congenital heart failure. She had a rapid pulse, dangerously high cholesterol and had

been taking blood pressure medication for over 30 years.



We immediately began her on a program of natural foods, exercise, daily walking

program and pure water. When she read in the Physicianâ€™s Desk Reference about the

side effects of the medications she was on, she decided to stop taking them.



During the 26-day program, Margie entered enthusiastical y into al activities; she

learned about how to take better care of her body and how to prepare delicious and

nutritious meals in a more healthful way. Every day she attended health classes to learn

how her body functions and what is required to maintain health. These are the same

health tips your wil learn in this book.



At the end of the program, she was 15 lbs. lighter, more energetic and happier

about her newly found lifestyle. One year later she was stil feeling good, maintaining a

healthy blood pressure, had a low pulse rate and has reached her target weight of 145 lbs.

She has also learned how to deal with the stresses in her life that was affecting her heart

condition.



â€œGod answered my prayers,â€ she said, â€œwhen He al owed me to learn about the

proper diet and lifestyle that al should fol ow if they plan to live in the New Earth.â€



In this book, I wil share these same health principles with you. There is no secret

magic formula, but fol owing these health principles produces miraculous results. If you

are underweight or overweight, suffering from some disease known or unknown, the

health principles outlined within the pages of this book can revolutionize your life.
