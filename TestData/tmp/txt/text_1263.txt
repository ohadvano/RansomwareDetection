I shake my head.
“We'll search the house. I'm sure she's fine Alice.”
Knowing Sam she's probably somewhere really obvious because she blends in so well with these people. Maybe she's found some guy to spend the night with and doesn't want to be disturbed, but as a concerned friend I just want to see for myself that she's okay.
“I think I'm gonna look for her upstairs to see if she's in one of the bedrooms. Do you mind checking outside?”
“Sure. We'll meet up in a few minutes by the campfire?” “Yeah.”
I rush out of the kitchen and make my way up the stairs. People are sitting on the steps which makes it extremely hard for me to pass - I slither my way as quickly as possible to reach the second level of the house and to my left, I see three doors, one of which is open, one ajar and one closed completely. I look to the right and see another three doors, two of which are open and one closed.
With my new ability, I try as hard as I can to reach out to hear Sam's voice but fail to hear her for I have no idea on how to use it.
With a disappointed sigh, I walk to the left side of the house and come face to face with the door that's ajar. The room is cast in blackness and the first thing I notice is the distinctive smell of beer and the sound of deep male voices. I open the door slowly only to see Bane and Kellan playing what looks like a first person shooting game, but the moment I step foot inside both of their heads turn in unison to my direction - it takes them a while to realize who I am. Bane looks at me for a second but loses interest and carries on playing the game, Kellan however smiles and gets up from his position on the couch.
“Alice! Didn't know you'd be attending our amazing party?” He picks me off the floor and crushes me tightly to his chest.
