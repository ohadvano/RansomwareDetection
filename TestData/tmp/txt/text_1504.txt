“What you did was unforgivable.”
Picturing Max's beaten face and him standing on crutches brings back the anger I had earlier today.
Ryder leans in close to my ear, his mouth slightly touching the top of my ear. “And I told you that I didn't do it.”
His whole body frames mine so perfectly that I lean slightly backwards into his tall frame. He leans forward, wraps his arm around my waist and pulls me tighter to him. I feel his warm, solid chest against my back.
“How do I know if you're telling the truth?” “Then, you'll just have to trust me.”
He rubs his nose behind my ear causing a shiver to run down my back.
I escape his hold. “Enough.”
I turn to face him to see him biting his lip with his eyes fixed on me, I pull my shirt down to cover myself. “What's the matter?” He strides over to me.
There's no way I'm getting close to him like that again. “You don't want me?”
