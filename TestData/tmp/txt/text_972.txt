Sam is practically begging me and she's causing a scene in front of our class.
Just as I'm about to respond to her, Mr. Edmund rounds the corner in his navy pea coat and black slacks. For a teacher he actually dresses quite smart.
He unlocks the classroom door and ushers everyone in. He waits in front of the classroom and stands opposite my desk with a smirk on his face. I take my seat when
suddenly the whole classroom goes silent, I understand why when I look up to see Ryder and his crew enter the room.
Mr. Edmund watches them very closely as they sit in their seats.
“Was I not clear yesterday?” Mr. Edmund's voice gathers everyone's attention.
The class remains silent.
I think about what Mr. Edmund's referring to and think about what happened in yesterday's lesson. The only events I can remember yesterday was the change, the fight with Ryder and Max's injuries.
Mr. Edmund looks at me with disappointment.
